"PLANET OF THE APES"
Screenplay

Michael Wilson
Based on Novel
By
Pierre Boulle
SHOOTING SCRIPT May 5, 1967
Stars glitter like diamonds on the black velvet backdrop of space.
The Belt of Orion is center screen, but much nearer and larger than ever seen by an Earth-bound astronomer.
A speck of light appears in the lower left corner of the screen.
No spaceship can be seen, but only a glowworm, a solitary sperma- tosoan gliding through the womb of the universe.
Over this we HEAR the voice of an astronaut.
He is concluding a report.
SHOOTING SCRIPT So ends my last signal until we reach our destination.
SHOOTING SCRIPT We are now on automatic, a mere hundred and five light years from our base ...
SHOOTING SCRIPT and at the mercy of com- puters.
SHOOTING SCRIPT I've tucked in my crew for the long sleep.
SHOOTING SCRIPT I'll join them presently.
The cabin is neither cramped nor spacious, but about the size of the President's cabin in Air Force One.
In the immediate f.g.
is a console of dials and switches flanked by four chairs.
Only one of the chairs is occupied.
The astronaut's back is to CAMERA.
There is a ladder amidships which leads to an escape hatch.
The after Dart of the cabin is obscured in darkness.
We hear the MUSIC of a Mozart sonata emanating from a phonograph of stereotape.
The astronaut is speaking into a microphone.
ASTRONAUT Within the hour we shall complete the sixth month of our flight from Cape Kennedy.
ASTRONAUT By our time, that is ...
He pauses, looking up at:
One clock is marked SELF TIME, but instead of twelve numerals it has twenty-four.
One of the needles is moving very slowly.
The other clock is labeled EARTH TIME, and its units, like those of a tachometer, are given by hundreds and thousands.
The largest needle of this clock makes one revolution every second.
Over this we hear:
ASTRONAUT But according to Dr. Hasslein theory of time in a vehicle traveling at close to the speed of light, old Mother Earth has aged a few thousand years since our de- parture -- while we have scarcely aged at all.
This is TAYLOR.
He wears simple dungarees (or Churchill suit) and comfortable boots.
He seems calm and pensive.
Extracting the butt of a cigar from the breast pocket of his dungarees, he lights it, then continues:
TAYLOR It may be so.
TAYLOR This much is probable: the men who sent us on this journey have long since been moldering in forgotten graves; and those, if any, who read this message are a different breed.
TAYLOR Hopefully, a better one.
TAYLOR He begins to roll up his left sleeve.
TAYLOR I leave the twentieth century without regret.
TAYLOR Who was it?
TAYLOR Marshall?
TAYLOR ...
TAYLOR said 'Modern man is the missin 'a link between the ape and the human being.'
TAYLOR He removes the cigar from his mouth, turns to look out through one of the portholes into the astral night.
TAYLOR One final thought -- nothing scientific, purely personal.
TAYLOR Seen from up here, everything looks different ...
TAYLOR Time bends and space is boundless.
TAYLOR It squashes a man's ego.
TAYLOR He begins to feel like no more than a mote in the eye of eternity.
TAYLOR And he is nagged by a question: ahat if any- thing, will greet us on the end of man's first journey to a star?
TAYLOR Are we to believe that throughout these thousands of galaxies, these millions of stars, only one, that speck of solar dust we call Earth, has been graced -- or cursed -- by human life?
TAYLOR I have to doubt it.
TAYLOR He extracts a hypodermic needle from his breast pocket and injects it into the vein of his forearm.
TAYLOR He continues speaking.
TAYLOR That's about all.
TAYLOR I wonder if Man, that marvel of the universe, that glorious paradox who has sent me to the unknown...
TAYLOR still makes war against his brother., and lets his neighbor's children starve.
TAYLOR Taylor withdraws the hypodermic needle from his vein and secures it in a drawer of the console.
TAYLOR Well then, Earthmen: A missing link salutes you.
TAYLOR Bless you, my descendants.
TAYLOR Taylor snuffs out the cigar butt and places it in the drawer beside the hypodermic.
TAYLOR Then, flicking a switch Au cut off the Mozart, he rises and
looks up again at:
The longest needle of this clock now makes nearly two revolutions per second.
The shortest needle points to the numeral 2105.
Space scientists have presumably solved the problem of weightlessness, for Taylor walks the short distance from; the console to the after section without particular effort.
CAMERA FOLLOWS him, and we can now see four glass capsules, or "caskets", in the rear of the cabin.
Taylor looks down at them.
10 One of them is open.
The other three are occupied by astronauts: DODGE, LANDON and STEWART.
They, too, wear dungarees and boots.
Dodge and Landon are thirtyish, clean-shaven, virile -- America's finest.
Stewart is a handsome young woman, her hair bobbed short.
Their eyes are closed and they do not appear to be breathing -- yet no undertaker could make them so alive.
He grasps the handle of his own casket and slowly pulls himself into it.
Continuing SILENCE.
CAMERA MOVES IN as Taylor Dulls the glass lid shut and secures it.
He adjusts two dials inside the capsule and lies back, buckling his safety belt.
CAMERA MOVES INTO A CLOSEUP of Taylor.
His eyes are open.
He seems serene, even enraptured.
(NOTE: Credits will appear here over a series of shots designed to convey a sense of loneliness, of separation, and of the passage of time.)
16 We see a strange and distant planet.
At first the globe occupies but a small area of the screen; but with each new VIEW it comes closer and looms larger, as if" observed from a spaceship in a spiraling orbit of descent.
The topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own.
Much of it is obscured by cloud cover; even more of-it appears to be cratered desert of reddish hue.
We can, however, make out a few narrow "green belts" and a patch of blue water.
In the FINAL SHOTS of this SEQUENCE we see the strange planet as it would be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand feet to one thousand feet.
It appears that the ship will fall into a vast lake surrounded by soaring sandstone pinnacles.
The water is blue-black, the pinnacles vermillion.
(This is the Lake Powell location, at Lone Rock.)
Four empty pilot seats are seen in f.g., the four glass caskets in b.g.
We HEAR the RHYTHMIC BLEAT of a WARNING SIGNAL, a RUSH OF WIND as in a rapid descent, and perhaps the ROAR OF RETROJETS.
Then, a great CRASH as the craft hits water.
The whole ship shudders on impact.
Loose equipment falls to the cabin floor.
CAMERA MOVES DOWN the cabin aisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and HOLDS on the four glass caskets.
There are THREE LOUD METALLIC CLICKS as the glass domes of the caskets swing open automatically.
He now has a full beard.
His eyes come open.
Instantly alert, he rises to a sitting position, gazing across at:
They, too, awaken and sit up, starring at Taylor.
They, too, are bearded.
TAYLOR You all right?
TAYLOR They nod.
He glances at the casket beside his own.
TAYLOR Stewart?
TAYLOR Stewart?
Its dome remains unopened.
The young woman is a skeleton in a Churchill suit.
Dodge and Landon have joined Taylor and-stare at the grinning skull of their dead comrade.
A low, descending HUM of equipment is heard.
Simultaneously the lights begin to FADE.
A moment later they brighten, but not as much as before.
TAYLOR There goes our primary power.
TAYLOR We're on auxilliary.
A slight CRACKING sound is heard.
Taylor turns quickly away and o.s.:
A trickle of water has begun to seep through a ruptured seam in the cabin.
Taylor darts to a porthole and peers cut.
water
The porthole is no more than six inches above the line.
In the distance we discern a shoreline of red desert.
TAYLOR We're in the soup.
TAYLOR We're sinking.
The leak in the seam becomes a growing spray of water.
Taylor turns away from the porthole, calling:
TAYLOR Dodge!
TAYLOR Read the atmosphere!
TAYLOR Dodge moves instantly to the ladder beneath an escape hatch and mounts it.
TAYLOR Taylor stumbles down the aisle of the rolling ship toward the console and addresses Landon, who is still staring at Stewart's skeleton.
TAYLOR Landon!
TAYLOR Send a last signal.
LANDON What signal?
TAYLOR To Earth!
TAYLOR That we've landed!
TAYLOR As Landon lurches toward the communications equipment in f.g.
ROCK, LAKE POWELL) We are looking at a lifeless desert of sandstone buttes and pinnacles.
ROCK, LAKE POWELL) There is no sign of vegetation anywhere.
ROCK, LAKE POWELL) CAMERA PANS DOWN to a body of water that could be the bay of an inland sea.
ROCK, LAKE POWELL) The deep blue of the sea contrasts sharply to the red sands of the shoreline.
ROCK, LAKE POWELL) CAMERA HOLDS on the stricken spaceship, wallowing like a beached whale a hundred yards offshore.
ROCK, LAKE POWELL) The portholes of the craft are beneath the water, and only its roof and the tail fin of its tail assembly are visible.
ROCK, LAKE POWELL) The red-hot skin of the ship vaporizes the water around it.
ROCK, LAKE POWELL) Suddenly a snorkel-like tube sprouts from the escape hatch, which is located amidships.
Dodge, standing halfway up the ladder., has fastened a kit of gauges to the end of the snorkel tube.
He reads the dials, removes the kit, sniffs the air in the tube and then, taking a deep breath, announces:
DODGE It's breathable.
DODGE Okay!
DODGE Blow the hatch before we lose auxilliary power.
DODGE Dodge reaches for a control mechanism near the escape hatch.
The spray of water coming through the ruptured seam is increasing.
The LIGHTS DIM again and the SOUND of the warning signal FADES.
While Landon fiddles with the radio, Taylor tries to get the tape recorder rolling, but all we hear are scrambled and unintelligible noises.
LANDON It's no use ...
LANDON there she goes.
TAYLOR Forget it.
TAYLOR Abandon ship.
The escape hatch is now open.
Taylor darts over to the ladder and passes a folded life raft up to Dodge.
When Landon reaches the ladder, Taylor hands him two neatly packed rucksacks, and Landon climbs through the escape hatch.
Taylor is about to follow with a third rucksack, then turns and crosses the cabin for a last look at:
Both clocks have stopped: the red needle of the clock labeled SELF TIME rests on the numeral 18; the red needle of the clock marked EARTH TIME rests on the numeral 3975.
Dodge inflates the raft with a cartridge of compressed air and tosses it into the water.
He and Landon jump into the water and climb onto the raft as Taylor emerges from the hatch, Taylor slips into the water and climbs onto the raft.
He and Landon begin to paddle toward shore, while Dodge immediately opens another kit and takes a sample of the water.
DODGE Briny...twenty-five percent salinity.
DODGE Near the saturation point.
LANDON She's still sinking...
Only the radio antenna and the tip of the tail fin remain visible.
LANDON Going ...
LANDON going...
LANDON The craft vanishes beneath the water.
Dodge is still busy with his kit.
Landon is still looking back, but Taylor doesn't bother to turn his head.
LANDON Gone.
TAYLOR We're here to stay.
They gaze at the forbidding sandstone battlements as they near the shore.
LANDON Well?
LANDON Where are we?
LANDON Have any notion, skipper?
TAYLOR We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth.
TAYLOR On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.
TAYLOR That could be Bellatrix.
Low on the horizon, seen through a dense envelope of dust particles.
TAYLOR Too red for Bellatrix.
Landon glances skeptically at Taylor.
LANDON You didn't have time to check the tapes, so you don't really know, do you?
LANDON What went wrong?
LANDON We weren't programmed to land in water.
DODGE The question, Landon, is not so much where we are as when we are.
TAYLOR We've had a nice snooze.
TAYLOR Let's start earning all our back pay.
As the three astronauts step out into shallow water and pull the raft ashore.
TAYLOR Take your soil test, Dodge.
TAYLOR I'll check the equipment.
TAYLOR Dodge moves inland about ten yards, removes a small hand drill from his belt, extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins to take some subsoil samplings.
TAYLOR Taylor begins to examine the contents of the three rucksacks.
TAYLOR Landon sits down on the beach., hands around his knees, gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship.
TAYLOR During this and succeeding scenes we sense that Dodge's obsession with scientific inquiry leaves him immune to fear: Landon is possibly more courageous and certainly more "human," for he has many fears to control: while Taylor -- detached, cool and misanthropic -- is something of an enigma.
TAYLOR Got your sensors?
DODGE Yo!
TAYLOR Geiger counter?
DODGE Yo!
TAYLOR One pistol...
TAYLOR twenty-four rounds of ammo.
TAYLOR two medical kits..
TAYLOR one camera...
TAYLOR one TX9.
TAYLOR We've enough food and water for three days.
DODGE But how long is a day?
TAYLOR Good question.
TAYLOR Landon -- check your communications kit.
He seems not to have heard.
TAYLOR Landon!
TAYLOR Join the expedition.
LANDON Sorry...
LANDON I was thinking of Stewart.
LANDON What d'you suppose happened?
TAYLOR Air leak.
TAYLOR Died in her sleep.
LANDON You don't seem very cut up about it.
TAYLOR It's a little late for a wake.
TAYLOR She's been dead nearly a year.
LANDON Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
TAYLOR By our time.
TAYLOR You've turned gray.
TAYLOR Landon involuntarily touches the gray hair of his temple as Taylor
adds lightly:
TAYLOR Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.
TAYLOR I read the clocks.
TAYLOR They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis.
TAYLOR We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.
TAYLOR Still can't accept it, huh?
LANDON long pause) You know it.
TAYLOR Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
LANDON Prove it.
LANDON If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
TAYLOR It's a fact, Landon.
TAYLOR Buy it.
TAYLOR You'll sleep better.
TAYLOR Dodge enters scene.
TAYLOR A handful of reddish sand dribbles through his fingers.
DODGE Nothing will grow here ....
DODGE there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
TAYLOR Any sign of dangerous ionization?
DODGE No.
TAYLOR Okay.
TAYLOR If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it.
TAYLOR That's when the groceries run out.
TAYLOR He picks up one of the rucksacks and puts it on.
TAYLOR The others follow suit.
DODGE Which direction?
TAYLOR That way.
DODGE Any particular reason?
TAYLOR None at all.
TAYLOR He moves out.
TAYLOR Dodge follows.
TAYLOR CAMERA PANS with them.
TAYLOR They have gone only a few paces when Taylor looks back over his shoulder and halts.
Landon is squatting in the sand, sticking something into the soil.
It is a small American flag, the size of a handkerchief.
Mirth bubbles up in Taylor's throat.
He explodes with wild laughter.
He is still laughing as they move out.
They descend from the plateau (Ochre Dunes)
Across the top of the hills there suddenly runs a line of fire (Black Dunes).
Jagged bolts of lightning flash across the sky, but bring, no rain, and thunder claps sound like heavy artillery.
(Gray Area)
58
SHOT - DAY Several huge boulders are dislodged, and the three astronauts run.
SHOT - DAY wildly to escape the falling rocks.
SHOT - DAY When the avalanche ends, they sprawl on the lifeless sands, breathing heavily and drenched with sweat, surrounded by enormous boulders.
SHOT - DAY Taylor looks about him.
TAYLOR Everybody all right?
TAYLOR Murmurs of assent from Dodge and Landon.
TAYLOR Taylor rummages through a limp rucksack, comes up with some empty food cartons,rummages again, coming up with a cigar butt.
TAYLOR Water check.
TAYLOR Dodge takes a plastic canteen from another rucksack and inspects it.
DODGE Eight ounces.
DODGE Dodge lies back and looks up at the sky.
DODGE It doesn't add up.
DODGE There's a mantle of dust around this planet and yet it's as humid as a jungle.
DODGE Thunder and lightning and yet no rain.
DODGE Cloud cover every night and that strange luminosity, and yet no moon.
DODGE Landon also looks up at the sky.
LANDON If only we could get a fix.
TAYLOR What would you learn?
TAYLOR I've told you where you are and when you are.
DODGE Taylor -- quit riding him.
TAYLOR You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet.
TAYLOR Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries.
TAYLOR Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
LANDON All right --
TAYLOR There's only one reality left.
TAYLOR We're here and it's now.
TAYLOR You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
LANDON I'm prepared to die.
LANDON Taylor turns to Dodge, throws up his hands.
TAYLOR He's prepared to die!
TAYLOR Doesn't that make you misty?
TAYLOR Chalk up another victory for the human spirit!
TAYLOR Dodge rises and moves off, o.s., either embarrassed by this colloquy or unwilling to hear it again.
TAYLOR Taylor, cigar clamped between his teeth, spins toward Landon.
TAYLOR Straighten me out on something.
TAYLOR Why did you come along at all?
TAYLOR You volunteered.
TAYLOR Why?
TAYLOR I'll tell you.
TAYLOR They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down.
TAYLOR Not without losing your All-American standing
LANDON Climb off me, will you!
TAYLOR And the glory, don't forget that.
TAYLOR There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere.
TAYLOR It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate.
TAYLOR But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
LANDON Taylor.
LANDON I'm telling you --
TAYLOR Oh, and one last item.
TAYLOR Immortality.
TAYLOR You wanted to go on forever.
TAYLOR Well, you damn near made it.
TAYLOR Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody.
TAYLOR And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain.
TAYLOR You got what you wanted, kid.
TAYLOR How does it taste?
TAYLOR Silence.
TAYLOR Taylor lies down, spent of his venom, pillowing his head on a rucksack.
LANDON Okay.
LANDON You read me well enough.
LANDON Why can't I read you?
TAYLOR Don't bother
LANDON Dodge ...
LANDON he's not like me at all.
LANDON But he makes sense.
LANDON Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew.
LANDON I understand why he's here.
LANDON But you...You're no seeker.
LANDON You're negative.
TAYLOR But I'm not prepared to die.
LANDON I'd like to know why not.
LANDON You thought life on Earth was meaningless.
LANDON You despised people.
LANDON So what did you do?
LANDON You ran away.
LANDON Taylor's eyes are closed.
LANDON He is silent for a moment.
LANDON When he speaks, his tone is soft, reflective.
TAYLOR No, not quite, Landon.
TAYLOR I'm a bit of a seeker myself.
TAYLOR But my dreams are a lot emptier than yours.
TAYLOR I can't get rid of the idea that somewhere in the Universe there must be a creature superior to man.
60	ANOTHER ANGLE - FEATURING DODGE who has been wandering around, studying the boulders and the barren soil.
Taylor and Landon can be seen in b.g.
Dodge spots something and squats down to examine it.
It is a tiny desert flower, no more than an inch high.
His eyes light up as he calls:
DODGE Taylor!
DODGE Over here!
63	CLOSE. GROUP SHOT - ANGLING DOWN as Taylor and Landon hurry over and kneel down on either side of Dodge.
The astronauts hover over the tiny flower like three magi perceiving the infant Deliverer.
DODGE Life.
DODGE He digs gently around the roots of the plant with a small instrument.
DODGE Where there's one there's another.
DODGE And another.
DODGE And another.
TAYLOR Let's find them all.
TO THE TAMARISK AREA Absolute desolation (Ochre Area).
TO THE TAMARISK AREA The astronauts start down the canyon.
As they move across the terrain (top of Crazy Canyon).
As they jump across a gap.
Thunder and lightning again (top of Crazy Canyon).
They march across Crazy Canyon overlook.
66-
(Wire Grass Canyon).
For a brief moment several "creatures" appear.
We cannot identify the species.
Blooming tamarisks border a.
dry stream bed.
Taylor and Landon hover over Dodge, who is probing the soil with his drill.
Their dungarees and faces are caked with dust.
DODGE It's a stream bed., no doubt about it -- but bone dry.
DODGE Landon strightens up and looks off, startled by something he sees.
LANDON Look.
68	LONG SHOT - A CLIFF BEYOND THE TAMARISKS with the astronauts in f.g.
In the distance, on the skyline, we can make out a long row of wooden crosses.
Some animal or vegetable matter appears to be tied to the crosses.
LANDON Scarecrows?
TAYLOR Let's take a look.
TAYLOR Taylor plunges into the thicket of tamarisks, followed by Dodge and Landon.
TAYLOR Their view of the cliff is momentarily obscured.
TAYLOR CAMERA HOLDS on the distant crosses.
TAYLOR For an instant only, three "creatures" again appear on the skyline near the crosses.
TAYLOR Then they vanish.
69	REVERSE ANGLE - THE ASTRONAUTS as they emerge from the tamarisk thicket-nearer to the base of the- cliff.
They halt and look up at:
We can now see the pelts of unrecognizable animals have been bound to the crosses and, thus mounted in a long row, seem to make a boundary or serve as a warning.
The living bipeds are no longer visible.
Dodge and Landon are still looking up at the strange crosses, but Taylor is scanning the terrain at the base of the cliff.
The sound of rushing water can be heard.
TAYLOR Never mind the scarecrows.
TAYLOR He breaks into a run, CAMERA PANNING with him as he moves toward a declivity in the face of the cliff.
Agonized with thirst, they follow Taylor.
For an instant we see the bipeds again, moving in the same direction.
He scrambles up a rock-strewn gorge and looks off at the terrain beyond.
The cascade is not spectacular, but the vegetation around it is startlingly lush.
(This location is not at Lake Powell, but at the Ranch).
His parched lips break into a smile.
The cascade has formed a cool and inviting pool.
Thick foliage grows to its very edge.
Dodge is on his hands and knees, testing the liquid with his kit.
The others wait expectantly.
DODGE It's loaded with minerals, but safe.
DODGE Without further ado Landon ducks his face into the pool.
DODGE Dodge scoops up water in his hands and drinks.
DODGE Taylor follows suit.
LANDON Can we take a dip?
TAYLOR Okay.
TAYLOR Landon and Dodge immediately remove their boots, strip down and plunge into the pool.
TAYLOR But Taylor does not yet disrobe.
TAYLOR Alert and curious, he strolls along the bank of the pool, looking around.
79	TAYLOR as he briefly looks around, then starts taking off his shirt.
80	DODGE AND LANDON as they arrive at opposite shore.
81	MED . SHOT - FAR SIDE OF POOL as Landon sees something on shore.
82	TAYLOR IN WATER as he swims across.
TAYLOR Hey, Taylor!
TAYLOR Look at this --
TAYLOR Dodge and Taylor climb out of the pool and squat beside Landon.
The print of a large five-toad foot is clearly visible in the wet sand.
Taylor rises and walks slowly toward the underbrush, scanning the ground for other sports.
Our view of the astronauts beyond the cascade in b.g.
is partially obscured by broad-leafed foliage directly in front of CAMERA, which PANS SLOWLY away from the waterfall and HOLDS on the astronauts' clothing at the edge of the pool.
Suddenly and inexplicably a pair of dungarees slithers away into the underbrush.
A few seconds pass.
Now a pair of bronzed and brawny shoulders fill the SCREEN, blocking our view.
Or is it human?
The hair is matted, the face bearded, the jaw prognathous, the orbital rim prominent.
A brown thick-fingered hand appears from behind heavy foliage and plucks at a boot.
The boot vanishes.
Dodge is standing near Taylor and looking back at the spot where they left their clothing.
Suddenly he seizes Taylor's arm and points silently at the far bank of the pool.
Another pair of dungarees slithers into the underbrush and disappears.
Led by Taylor, they dive back into the pool and swim to the other bank.
Emerging from the water, they look around in bewilderment.
Taylor makes hand signals to indicate absolute silence and a reconnaissance.
The three astronauts fan out and move cautiously into the jungle (or rain forest).
91-
ASTRONAUT'S Little sunlight penetrates this dense vegetation.
ASTRONAUT'S These SHOTS are
INTERCUT with:
fleeting forms as yet unidentified; trembling foliage; brown shadows against a green backdrop.
95	EXT. A SMALL CLEARING - FAVORING THE THREE ASTRONAUTS who stop at the edge of the clearing, startled by
a number of primitive bipeds, male and female, scarcely visible behind trees and bushes on the other side of the clearing -- here a face, there a portion of a head and torso.
Throughout this sequence, the primitives are never seen clearly or at close range.
97	BACK TO THE AST40IONAUTS reacting.
They speak in whispers.
LANDON My God..they look almost human.
DODGE They -- there's a herd of them.
TAYLOR Show them we're friendly.
TAYLOR CAMERA PULLS BACK as Taylor advances a few steps into the clearing, extending his empty hands and beaming like a politician.
TAYLOR Greetings!
There are perhaps a dozen of them.
They shrink back as Taylor advances -- hostile, frightened or both.
We now see that some of them are clutching articles of the astronauts' clothing and equipment.
Taylor stops, stares at them glumly.
TAYLOR No cigar.
LANDON Try telling them our names.
LANDON Taylor grimaces at Landon.
TAYLOR Well, if we're looking for an icebreaker...
TAYLOR Listen, folks .....
TAYLOR More shrinking back by the frightened primitives.
DODGE I'm afraid they aren't having any.
102
105
A pistol goes off with a deafening crash, and the primitive creatures scatter in panicky flight.
After a while, quiet returns to the jungle.
They examine the remnants of their clothing and equipment and start to don whatever is able to be worn.
Taylor puts on what remains of a ripped pair of trousers; Dodge starts to improvise from the remnants of the kit (it is a torn shelter half).
Landon, like Taylor, has the remains of his pants.
DODGE They didn't leave much did they?
LANDON Shall we follow them?
TAYLOR Haven't much choice.
TAYLOR As they walk off down the jungle path.
This need not be a cultivated grove.
A few trees (peach or apricot or avocado, it matters not) grow wild in a pleasant glade.
Nor is the grove extensive.
The three astronauts sit under a tree in f.g.; the primitives sit under a clump, of trees some fifty yards away.
Each camp is feeding and warily watching the other.
In the distance beyond the fruit trees is an open grassy plain or cultivated field.
They too are sitting under trees, munching fruit.
There are no more than a dozen altogether.
TAYLOR Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
DODGE Blessed are the vegetarians.
Squatting on her haunches, eating fruit, gazing back at Taylor.
Her hair is long and black, her skin nut brown, her face hauntingly lovely and hauntingly stupid.
This is NOVA.
Landon looks o.s.
at the primitives.
LANDON We got off at the wrong stop.
TAYLOR You're our optimist Look at the bright side.
TAYLOR If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
DODGE Look...
They appear to be agitated although neither we nor the astronauts have yet heard or seen any cause for alarm.
The primitives get to their feet, sniffing, listening
Puzzled and alarmed by the primitives' behavior, they too get to their feet.
LANDON Think they'll attack us?
Taylor turns, looks back at:
From which they recently emerged.
There is no sign of life.
They suddenly run laterally across the grove, heading back toward their jungle.
A rumble becomes audible it is the SOUND of HOOFBEATS.
Twelve "horsemen" suddenly emerge from the trees, riding abreast at a canter, like a squadron of cavalry about to charge.
The horses look huge.
So do the riders, but at this distance we cannot identify them.
Cut off from their natural habitat, they reverse direction and flee toward the tall grasses of the savanna (or cultivated field).
With an exultant battle cry they break into a gallop.
The hunt is on.
Stupefied, frozen in place.
Coming closer.
We HEAR a rifle shot, then a flurry of shots.
A bullet spanks into the fruit trees above their heads.
They run, CAMERA PANNING with them as they race toward the tall grass in deep b.g.
124 As the "horsemen" close in on the creatures fleeing on foot.
He reins in, raises his rifle and fires.
For the first time, we se that he is a GORILLA.
He wears a simple quasi-military uniform -- tunic, trousers and boots.
Running through the high grass.
He is shot in the back and falls.
He drops at the side of his fallen comrade.
As Taylor rolls him over.
Dodge is dead.
The beaters are all GORILLAS.
They carry long sticks and nets, and their task is to flush out the terrified primitives cowering in the tall grass.
135 (a) Landon flees from one rider only to be cut off by another.
He stumbles and a rearing stallion tramples him.
(b) A third mounted gorilla flings a net over a running female.
She is hopelessly entangled.
This is Nova.
(c) Landon lies unconscious on the grassy plain, an ugly gash on his forehead.
(d) Taylor crawls through the tall grass on his hands and knees.
A rider crosses his path without seeing him.
(e) The beaters close in on Taylor, blocking his escape route.
(f) Taylor changes direction and decides to run for it.
Bent low, he flees through the tall grass.
A SHOT rings out.
Taylor falls.
Lying on his back.
His fingers go to his throat.
Blood appears between his fingers.
He opens his mouth in pain, but no sound comes forth, as Taylor sinks into unconsciousness.
The hunting party has reassembled here beneath the fruit trees.
Some of the gorillas have dismounted; others are still on horseback.
In the middle distance is a crude horse-drawn wagon.
The sides and top of the wagon form a wire cage.
Three captive males and one female are visible within the cage.
Dodge and Landon are nowhere to be seen.
Two gorilla porters enter scene, dragging a male human corpse by the ankles, as two other bearers enter scene with a living burden on a long carrying pole.
Taylor dangles from the pole, held aloft by the bonds around his wrists and ankles.
CAMERA PANS with the two gorillas as they dump Taylor into the wagon and close the tail gate.
140
His throat is smeared with blood.
His eyelids flutter as he regains consciousness.
Three primitive males bound hand and foot.
They seem docile in captivity.
The female, Nova, clasps bound wrists around her bound ankles and gazes blankly at Taylor.
There is a JOLT of MOVEMENT as the wagon gets underway
With a great effort he raises himself on one elbow and looks out from the cage.
A gorilla hunter stands over a dead man, one foot planted he chest of his kill and his rifle butt resting on the on abdomen.
Facing him is another gorilla with an old-fashioned camera on a tripod.
APE PHOTOGRAPHER Smile.
APE PHOTOGRAPHER The hunter bares his teeth.
He faints.
The surgery is dimly-lit.
(If possible we should be unaware of the source of illumination.)
Taylor lies strapped to the nearer table.
He appears to be unconscious.
The young female captive, Nova, is strapped to the table beside him.
She is conscious.
Taylor is receiving a direct blood transfusion from her.
Hovering over Taylor are a NURSE and a surgeon named GALEN.
Both are chimpanzees.
Galen wears a bloody surgical apron, the nurse a white smock.
Galen is removing a filthy bandage from Taylor's neck.
A door behind them opens and DR.
ZIRA, an animal psychologist, enters.
She, too, is a chimpanzee and wears a smock like the nurse's.
ZIRA Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
GALEN Him.
GALEN Zira looks down at Taylor.
ZIRA Will he live?
GALEN I don't know.
GALEN This beast lost a lot of blood.
GALEN Galen paws through a tray of surgical instruments.
GALEN The equipment is obsolescent and the room untidy -- like that of a callous small-town veterinarian.
GALEN There's no probe here.
GALEN Find one!
NURSE Yes, sir.
NURSE She exits.
NURSE Zira runs a forefinger across a dusty table.Her voice is soft and well-modulated.
ZIRA This place is dirty, doctor.
GALEN These animals are dirty, doctor.
GALEN They stink, and they carry communicable diseases.
GALEN Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
His eyes come open.
Over this we hear:
GALEN You don't sound happy in your work.
GALEN I'm nothing more than a vet in this laboratory...
GALEN Taylor feebly turns his head and looks at Nova.
GALEN She returns his gaze with an unchanged empty stare.
GALEN We sense that Taylor realizes her blood
is flowing into his veins.
Over this we hear:
GALEN You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius about me.
GALEN I did.
GALEN But you know how he looks down his nose at chimpanzees.
GALEN Taylor rolls his eyes toward the apes.
GALEN Weak as he is,we see his astonishment at hearing them talk.
148	BACK TO GROUP AROUND OPERATING TABLE as the Nurse reenters with a probe and hands it to Dr. Galen, who protests to Zira:
GALEN But the quota system's been abolished!
GALEN You made it.
GALEN Why can't I?
ZIRA What do you mean, made it?
ZIRA I'm an animal psychologist, that's all.
ZIRA We don't have any authority.
GALEN You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
ZIRA That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
GALEN Hmph.
ZIRA The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
GALEN They're still dirty.
GALEN And their bite is septic.
GALEN Look at that ...
GALEN He shows Zira infected teeth marks on the back of his left hand.
GALEN Hold his head.
GALEN The Nurse complies, gripping Taylor's skull with both hands.
GALEN Galen leans down and begins to probe the throat wound.
GALEN Taylor passes out.
The cages are no larger than small jail cells.
There are four of them.
Bars, not walls, divide the cages, so that all four are visible.
Each of the first three cages is occupied by a primitive male.
At the moment the first two are quiet -- dozing or scratching apathetically.
The third occupant is stolidly regarding a half-dozen brightly colored hollow wooden boxes, or blocks, Of varying sizes and proportions on the floor of his cage.
He is trying to stack the boxes in such a way as to reach a banana dangling from a cord twelve feet overhead.
He has correctly selected the first two large, sturdy blocks for his tower under the banana -- but the tall third block is too unstable on its small base to support the broad-based fourth block.
Taylor, Looking much stronger, sits on a pile of dirty straw in the fourth cage.
There is a clean bandage around his throat.
He watches the block-building primitive with contemptous amusement.
Both the third and fourth blocks tumble to the floor when the primitive tries to mount his tower.
He stands there, staring dully at the scattered blocks, then up at the unattainable banana.
A door at the end of the aisle opens and a gorilla named JULIUS enters, dressed in a keeper's uniform.
He quickly closes the door, snatches up a broom, starts sweeping.
Julius is obviously late for work.
Taylor struggles to his feet, moves to the bars of the cage, tries to call out.
TAYLOR Hey!
TAYLOR Hey!
TAYLOR The three other primitives move toward the bars of their cages.
TAYLOR Julius barks at them.
JULIUS Simmer down!
JULIUS You especially.
JULIUS The third primitive goes back to stacking his blocks.
JULIUS Julius comes up to Taylor's cage, indicates a like set of blocks strewn across its floor, extends his broom handle to whack the banana overhead.
JULIUS Better give it a try, stupid.
JULIUS Unless you like going hungry.
JULIUS He returns to his sweeping.
JULIUS Taylor glowers at him.
JULIUS A moment later, the door at the end of the aisle opens and Dr. Zira enters.
JULIUS Good morning, Dr. Zira.
ZIRA Good morning, Julius.
ZIRA How's our patient today?
JULIUS No change.
JULIUS The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
JULIUS She starts down the aisle toward Taylor's cage.
JULIUS He grasps the bars, awaiting her anxiously.
JULIUS As she passes the second cage, the primitive in it shakes the bars, jumps up and down.
JULIUS His tongue is hanging out.
JULIUS Zira smiles, stops, digs into the pocket of her smock.
ZIRA Well, what do we want this morning?
ZIRA Do we want something?
ZIRA Speak!
ZIRA Come on, speak!
ZIRA The primitive continues to jump up and down energetically.
ZIRA Zira takes a cube of sugar from her pocket, holds it up for his inspection.
ZIRA Do we want some sugar, old-timer?
ZIRA The man eagerly sticks his hand through the bars.
ZIRA She drops the cube in his hands.
ZIRA He jams it into his mouth.
JULIUS You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
ZIRA Don't be silly.
ZIRA He's perfectly tame.
ZIRA She moves toward Taylor's cage, Julius behind her.
JULIUS They're all tame until they take a chunk out of you.
Taylor starts to open his mouth as Zira comes up to the bars.
ZIRA Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
TAYLOR Listen, listen -- I can speak --
TAYLOR He winces, puts his hand to the bandage.
ZIRA Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
JULIUS See?
JULIUS He keeps pretending he can talk.
JULIUS Taylor glares at Julius, slams the bars.
TAYLOR I'm not pretending!
TAYLOR I can talk!
TAYLOR Zira hurriedly takes a pen and notebook from the breast Docket of her smock, starts to scribble.
ZIRA Did you see that?
ZIRA It's remarkable!
JULIUS Huh?
ZIRA He's trying to form words.
JULIUS Well, you know what they say.
JULIUS Human see, human do.
JULIUS Taylor is staring in silent fascination at the open and notebook.He stops mouthing, points at them.
JULIUS Now what?
JULIUS Taylor gestures for Zira to come closer to the bars.
ZIRA He seems to want something.
ZIRA She advances tentatively toward the cage.
JULIUS I'd be careful, doctor.
JULIUS Taylor suddenly reaches through the bars, tries to snatch the pen and notebook from Zira.
JULIUS Julius instantly jabs his broom handle through the bars, hitting Taylor in the ribs.
JULIUS What did I tell you!
JULIUS Try that again, I'll break your arm!
JULIUS Zira draws back, looking at Taylor in surprise.
His face is twisted in frustration.
TAYLOR What's the matter with you?
TAYLOR I can talk!
TAYLOR Can't you see that?
TAYLOR Over this a door is heard opening o.s., and Julius' voice, nervous,
deferential:
TAYLOR Good morning, Your Excellency.
TAYLOR Taylor looks o.s.
160
Julius and Zira cross to a stout, imposing orangutan who has just entered the laboratory.
Julius bows to him.
This is DR.
ZAIUS.
Like the other apes, he wears a simple tunic and trousers, but his garments are of a Costlier material, and several decorations are woven into the sash of his tunic.
ZIRA Dr. Zaius, I'm so glad you could come.
ZIRA He's over here.
ZIRA Zaius crosses with them to Taylor's cage.
ZIRA Beneath his austere manner, we sense tension, worry.
ZIRA Zira looks up at Taylor, her tone an appeal.
ZIRA Bright Eyes, show him!
ZIRA Go ahead!
ZIRA Do your trick!
ZIRA Taylor just glares at her.
ZIRA Speak!
ZIRA Go on.
ZIRA Speak again.
TAYLOR My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
ZIRA There!
ZIRA Can you believe it?
ZIRA I looks like he's talking.
ZAIUS Yes, amusing.
ZAIUS A man who acts like an ape.
ZAIUS Taylor turns to Zaius.
TAYLOR I'm not acting!
TAYLOR I can talk!
TAYLOR How much proof do you want?
ZIRA Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
ZAIUS He shows a definite gift for mimicry.
ZAIUS Zira wiggles her fingers excitedly.
ZIRA I wonder how held score on a Hopkins manual dexterity test?
ZIRA Zaius' voice is quiet, but there is steel in it.
ZAIUS An animal?
JULIUS Look!
JULIUS Taylor is frantically wiggling his fingers.
ZIRA He's moving his fingers!
ZAIUS Of course.
ZAIUS He saw you moving yours.
ZIRA But perhaps he understood --
He is pleading silently as Zaius' voice is heard over the SHOT.
ZAIUS' VOICE Man has no understanding, Dr. Zira.
ZAIUS' VOICE He can be taught a few simple tricks.
ZAIUS' VOICE Nothing more.
ZAIUS' VOICE I beg to disagree.
ZAIUS' VOICE According to my exper- iments --
A warning burns out of his eyes as he stares at Taylor.
ZAIUS A word to the wise, Dr. Zira.
ZAIUS Experimental brain surgery on these creatures is one thing.
ZAIUS I'm all for it.
Fear clouds his eyes.
Abruptly, he stops moving his lips.
Zaius sees the effect his words have had on Taylor.
He turns to Zira, goes on in a more detached tone.
ZAIUS But your behavioral studies are another matter entirely.
ZAIUS To suggest that we can learn something about simian nature from a study of man is nonsense.
ZAIUS Besides, men are a nuisance.
ZAIUS They outgrow their own food supply in the forest and migrate to our green belts and ravage our crops.
ZAIUS The sooner they're exterminated, the better.
ZAIUS He turns toward the door.
ZAIUS A disappointed Zira follows him.
ZAIUS Zaius looks back at Taylor just before going out.
ZAIUS It's a question of simian survival.
He stares after Zaius, than looks away, slumps to the floor.
A pause, then a VOICE is heard.
APE GUARD Is this the one you wanted, Doctor?
APE GUARD Yes, thank you.
APE GUARD Bright Eyes?
APE GUARD Taylor looks up.
APE GUARD I've got a present for you.
Standing outside the cage, held on a leash by an APE GUARD is Nova.
She looks at Taylor without expression.
Zira gestures at JULIUS.
ZIRA Put her in with him.
ZIRA Julius unlocks the cage door-, leads Nova inside, removes her leash and collar.
ZIRA Taylor has gotten to his feet.
ZIRA Julius goes out, locking the door behind him.
ZIRA Nova hesitates, then slowly reaches out, takes Taylor's hand.
ZIRA Zira beams at them.
169
It is nothing elaborate, A wire fence encloses a dirt yard.
This compound is situated on the outskirts of Apetown and the town is visible in the distance.
There are about a dozen adult human captives within the enclosure, no more than a third of them females.
Some of them trudge around the dusty yard like convicts in a penitentiary.
Others squat against the sun- drenched wall.
A big male suddenly runs to the fence and tries to climb it.
Several guides, armed with whips and torches, immediately close in on him.
The primitive recoils in fear from a fiery torch and rejoins the captives' circle.
He plods sullenly back and forth across the rear of the yard, occasionally glancing off toward the approaches to the compound.
Nova is at his heels.
He ignores her.
Once again he looks off, stops suddenly.
Nova bumps into him.
He turns, impatiently shoos her away, then looks o.s., again.
Zira can be seen approaching with a young chimpanzee, DR.
CORNELIUS.
He wears a simple smock over his tunic and trousers.
Cornelius glances surreptitiously around, covertly takes Zira's hand.
CORNELIUS Do you have to work tonight?
ZIRA No.
CORNELIUS Neither do I.
CORNELIUS He gives her a quick peck on the cheek.
He drifts toward the fence, Nova behind him.
They come up to the fence.
Zira nods toward Taylor.
ZIRA That's Bright Eyes.
ZIRA The one I was telling you about.
CORNELIUS What's so special about him?
ZIRA Watch.
ZIRA Hello, Bright Eyes.
ZIRA How's our throat today?
ZIRA Taylor stares at her impassively, then looks around to a that no guards are watching, hunkers down, begins to scratch in the dust.
ZIRA Nova extends unclean fingers to touch the bandage on his throat.
ZIRA Taylor flinches, pushes her hand away.
ZIRA Nova touches a bluish bruise on the inside of her own forearm, then searches for a similar bruise on Taylor's forearm.
ZIRA Look -- she remembers.
CORNELIUS Remembers what?
ZIRA The blood transfusion.
CORNELIUS Zira, come on.
CORNELIUS You know they can't --
CORNELIUS Oh oh.
CORNELIUS Here comes Number One.
CORNELIUS Taylor looks up and o.s., quickly rises.
Who is approaching the two scientists from deep b.g.
Zaius is followed by a huge and much decorated gorilla Whom we recognize as the Leader of the Hunt Club.
ZIRA Something's bothering him.
ZIRA He's been prying around the lab for the last two days ...
ZIRA Good morning, Dr. Zaius.
ZIRA You know Dr.
ZIRA Cornelius, my fiance.
ZIRA Cornelius bows respectfully.
ZIRA Zaius is patronizingly polite.
ZAIUS Oh, yes -- the young ape with a shovel.
ZAIUS I hear you're planning another archeological expedition.
He has stepped back from the marks he made in the-dust, is watching Zaius with concern.
ZAIUS Yes, sir.
ZAIUS If the academy agrees.
ZAIUS The project will require my support, of course.
A primitive male squats down to see what Taylor has marked on the ground.
In letters a foot high he has written:
I CAN WRITE Nova, at once petulant and playful, erases the WRITE with a bare foot.
I CAN WRITE Taylor angrily flings her aside.
I CAN WRITE This violence provokes the primitive male, who snarls at Taylor and cuffs him.
I CAN WRITE Over this we HEAR from a
distance:
I CAN WRITE I hope I can count on it, sir.
ZAIUS' VOICE A friendly warning, Cornelius -- when you're digging for artifacts, don't bury your reputation.
ZAIUS' VOICE Taylor slugs the snarling male, who wades in, trying to bite him.
ZAIUS' VOICE Guards!
Two gorilla guards rush in to break up the fight.
One of them lashes out with his whip.
The other pokes his torch at Taylor.
Its flame brushes his arm.
Taylor opens his mouth, gives a silent yell of pain, shrinks back.
Zira runs to the fence.
ZIRA Stop!
ZIRA You've hurt him!
ZIRA Take them inside!
ZIRA Prodding the malcreants with their torches, the two guards herd them toward a doorway in the wall.
ZIRA Zira hurries around the side of the fence and o.s.
ZAIUS Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
CORNELIUS Certainly, sir.
CORNELIUS I'll get my notes and come right over.
CORNELIUS He exits hurriedly.
CORNELIUS The Hunt Club Leader turns to Zaius.
HUNT CLUB LEADER I don't understand these animal psychologists.
HUNT CLUB LEADER What's Dr. Zira trying to prove?
ZAIUS That man can be domesticated.
The hunter guffaws.
Zaius turns away and looks down at:
Just beyond the fence we can make out the letters:
I CAN Zaius' extended foot appears beneath the bottom wire of the fence.
I CAN The foot wipes out the letters.
His face is a mask.
He is slumped against the bars of the cell, gingerly touching a large, reddening blotch on his arm.
Julius watches him uncertainly from a few yards away .
In the b.g., the outside door opens and Zira rushes in, hurries down the aisle.
JULIUS What happened?
ZIRA Those fools and their torches!
ZIRA Do you have any ointment?
JULIUS I'll see.
JULIUS He moves to a cabinet at the other end of the laboratory, rummages through some drawers.
Zira comes up to Taylor's cage, studies him solicitously.
ZIRA I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.
He looks steadily at Zira, who is only an arm's length away.
CAMERA MOVES IN on them.
Suddenly Taylor reaches out, snatching the pen and notebook from the pocket of her smock.
Zira leaps back with a cry.
Julius grabs a club, races up to the cage, unlocks the door.
JULIUS I told you what you'd get!
Taylor is scribbling furiously on a sheet of note paper.
The guard moves in, his club upraised.
ZIRA Julius, don't.
ZIRA It doesn't matter.
ZIRA Julius swings his-club at Taylor's head.
ZIRA Taylor lifts his right arm to ward off the blow, and the stick strikes him sharply on the hand.
ZIRA He drops the pen and notebook.
ZIRA The guard swings again, driving Taylor to the wall.
ZIRA Then Julius retrieves the stolen articles.
The guard returns her pen and notebook with the comment:
JULIUS Natural born thieves, aren't they?
JULIUS Zira glances at the notebook.
JULIUS Her face clouds.
A hasty, almost illegible scrawl:
Her eyes afire with a wild surmise.
Her eyes never leave Taylor as she tells the guard:
ZIRA Get me a collar and leash.
ZIRA I'm taking him to the infirmary.
JULIUS He's vicious, Doctor.
JULIUS Besides, it's against the rules.
ZIRA Do as I say.
ZIRA The guard shrugs and moves Off 0.3.
ZIRA Zira beckons to Taylor.
ZIRA He comes forward to the bars of the cage.
ZIRA You wouldn't hurt me, would you...
ZIRA Taylor?
The office is simple, almost Spartan.
There are books but no bric-a- brac; several painted portraits of Great Apes but no tape recorder or other modern office equipment.
Taylor sits at a desk, scribbling furiously on a sheet of paper.
His leash has been removed, but not his collar.
Zira stands at his elbow.
Cornelius paces nervously up and down, reading a sheaf of notes Taylor has already written.
CORNELIUS It's a stunt.
CORNELIUS Humans don't write.
ZIRA Dear, you're a scientist.
ZIRA Don't you believe your own eyes?
CORNELIUS Where did you learn to do this?
Taylor scribbles something on a small desk pad, rips off the page, hands it to Cornelius.
CORNELIUS Jefferson Public School, Fort Wayne, Indiana?
CORNELIUS He looks at Taylor narrowly.
CORNELIUS Taylor nods.
CORNELIUS Back on that planet you say you came from?
CORNELIUS Um-hm.
CORNELIUS He may be intelligent, but he's also mad.
CORNELIUS Taylor scribbles something else on the pad, hands it to Zira, points at Cornelius.
ZIRA 'And you're a fool'.
ZIRA She smiles.
ZIRA Cornelius bristles.
CORNELIUS Now, just a minute --
ZIRA Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
ZIRA Taylor has resumed writing.
ZIRA He hands the sheet to Zira, who reads aloud.
ZIRA 'Dodge was killed in the hunt.
ZIRA What happened to Landon?'
ZIRA I don't know.
CORNELIUS And they fell out of the sky with you?
CORNELIUS Taylor writes quickly, hands the note to Zira.
ZIRA 'Not fell -- flew!'
ZIRA Taylor impatiently begins to fold a sheet of paper.
CORNELIUS Flight is a scientific impossibility.
ZIRA And even if it weren't, why fly?
ZIRA Where would it get you?
ZIRA Taylor points to the floor and mouths the word "Here."
ZIRA He flings the paper plane he has just fashioned into the air.
ZIRA It describes a graceful arc around the room and lands at the feet of Cornelius, who slowly picks it up, then exchanges a long glance with Zira.
CORNELIUS Well, now...
CORNELIUS Taylor scribbles on a piece of paper, hands it to Zira.
ZIRA 'Do you have maps?'
ZIRA Cornelius puts the paper plane on his desk, crosses to a wall map designed like a window shade.
ZIRA He pulls it down Taylor and Zira join him at the map.
It's not a map of the whole planet, of course, but only of that portion known to the apes.
Therefore it has the antique and fragmentary aspect of a map drawn by some Babylonian cartographer.
A swatch of blue at the right margin indicates a sea.
In the southwest quadrant are the "greenbelts" of the ape civilization, looking on the map like jade stones strung on crescent-shaped necklace.
Rubyidots in the lade indicate ape communities.
The northwest quadrant, colored brown, is apparently uninhabited.
East of the green belts is a patch of green savanna, and next to it the darker green of a jungle.
The eastern quadrants are rendered in yellow, and except for a blue lake, appear to be lifeless desert and barren mountain.
This area is marked FORBIDDEN
ZONE. Using a pointer, Cornelius orients Taylor, indicating a red dot in the middle of the green belt.
CORNELIUS We are here ...
CORNELIUS You were captured about here.
CORNELIUS Taylor studies the map, then pointing at the lake in the eastern desert, he goes into a brief charade, dramatizing the astronauts' landing and trek.
ZIRA You fell in the water here?
ZIRA ...
ZIRA you came ashore ...
ZIRA you marched across the desert ...
ZIRA the mountains ...
ZIRA many days and nights ...
ZIRA and reached the jungle.
ZIRA Taylor nods, smiles gratefully.
CORNELIUS Out - of - the - question!.
CORNELIUS Taylor slams his fist against the wall in frustration.
ZIRA Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
CORNELIUS No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone.
CORNELIUS I've been there.
CORNELIUS I've seen it.
Taylor strides to the desk, writes something, hands it to Zira.
ZIRA 'Then how do you account for me?,
CORNELIUS I don't.
CORNELIUS And I'm not going to try.
ZIRA But what about your theory?
ZIRA The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
CORNELIUS Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
ZIRA Don't be foolish.
ZIRA If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
CORNELIUS No, they won't -
CORNELIUS Taylor touches Zira on the arm, makes a gesture of inquiry.
ZIRA Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
CORNELIUS It's probably wrong --
ZIRA -- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man.
ZIRA In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
CORNELIUS The evidence was very meager --
ZIRA You didn't think so then.
CORNELIUS That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
ZIRA How can scientific truth be heresy?
ZIRA What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed?
ZIRA A mutation.
ZIRA A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
ZIRA Taylor bangs his fist on the desk, mouths the word "No!" scribbles something on a piece of paper.
CORNELIUS He's touchy, isn't he?
CORNELIUS Taylor thrusts the sheet at Zira, who reads it aloud.
ZIRA 'I am not a missing link.'
CORNELIUS Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
ZIRA Well, maybe they're not.
CORNELIUS No, thank you'.
CORNELIUS I won't get into that battle.
ZIRA Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
CORNELIUS Zira, listen to me.
CORNELIUS We've got a fine future ahead of us.
CORNELIUS Marriage.
CORNELIUS Stimulating careers.
CORNELIUS I'm up for a raise --
CORNELIUS At that moment there is a.
CORNELIUS loud RAP at the door o.s.
CORNELIUS All turn.
Dr. Zaius enters with another portly figure, DR.
MAXIMUS.
Like Zaius., Maximus is an orangutan.
CORNELIUS Dr. Zaius --
ZAIUS Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
CORNELIUS Oh., no., sir.
CORNELIUS I was just assembling my notes.
ZAIUS You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
CORNELIUS Certainly, sir.
CORNELIUS It's a pleasure to see you again.
CORNELIUS He hurries to his desk, starts gathering papers.
CORNELIUS Maximus notes Taylor with distaste.
MAXIMUS What is that?
ZIRA A man, Dr. Maximus.
MAXIMUS I know it's a man.
MAXIMUS And you know the rules.
MAXIMUS No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
During the ensuing exchange, Zaius wanders idly through the office.
He glances at the scattered handwritten notes, but does not read them.
Meanwhile a rattled Zira replies to Maximus.
ZIRA Yes, Sir.
ZIRA But this -- creature is a special case.
MAXIMUS Why special?
ZIRA We're -- conducting a new experiment.
ZAIUS Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
ZIRA Yes, Sir.
MAXIMUS Guards?
MAXIMUS The gorilla GUARDS enter from outside.
MAXIMUS Return this beast to the compound.
He regards the apes with hostility as they cross to him.
One picks up his leash.
Over THE SHOT we hear:
MAXIMUS What's this?
Zira stiffens, looking at Zaius.
He is holding the paper plane fashioned by Taylor.
ZIRA A toy.
ZIRA It floats on the air.
ZIRA Try it.
CORNELIUS Zira....
CORNELIUS Zaius looks down at the paper plane in his hand, then back to Zira.
CORNELIUS He smiles tolerantly.
ZAIUS Nonsense.
ZAIUS He crumples the paper plane into a b all., drops it on the desk.
ZAIUS The ape hooks the leash to Taylor's collar, starts leading him out.
ZAIUS Zira follows them.
The caged primitives are asleep.
Julius, the keeper, dozes in a chair outside Taylor's cage.
CAMERA PIVOTS MOVING IN ON Taylor, who is lying on his side, also asleep.
Nova is curled up behind him.
At the sound of a door opening, she comes instantly awake, sitting up and clutching Taylor's arm.
He comes groggily awake, raising his head in time to hear:
ZAIUS What's up, Lieutenant?
TWO GORILLA OFFICERS have just entered the compound.
They wear side arms.
Julius has just risen from his chair.
APE LIEUTENANT We're taking Number Four over to surgery in five minutes.
APE LIEUTENANT Have him ready.
JULIUS How come?
JULIUS The beast's throat is nearly healed.
LIEUTENANT It's not his throat this time.
LIEUTENANT The vet's going to geld him.
He stiffens but does not move.
The apes, of course, speak freely in front of him, believing the animal cannot understand.
LIEUTENANT Dr. Zira won't like it.
LIEUTENANT She wants this pair to mate.
As the Lieutenant replies:
LIEUTENANT These orders came from Dr. Zaius himself.
LIEUTENANT There's nothing she can do about it.
LIEUTENANT The two gorillas exit.
LIEUTENANT The guard crosses to a wall peg for a collar and 'Leash.
Pushing Nova aside, Taylor rises.
As Julius unlocks the door and cautiously approaches Taylor, carrying the collar and leash.
JULIUS If only you knew, Bright Eyes, what they're going to do ...
JULIUS Stand still now...don't give me any trouble.
JULIUS The heel of Taylor's right palm crashes into the keeper's, chin, nearly snapping his neck.
JULIUS Julius falls unconscious.
JULIUS Taylor leans over him, taking his night stick and a set of keys on his belt.
The male has awakened.
He stares stupidly at Taylor.
Nova is whimpering, little strange cries of fear.
Taylor moves o.s.
He leaves the cage, moves swiftly to the nearby door and exits.
Barefoot, Taylor silently pads down the corridor to a locked door.
Which is visible because of a beam of sunlight from the half-open door of a guard room.
We HEAR a murmur of ape voices and LAUGHTER.
Taylor fumbles with the keys, finds one that fits the lock and opens the door.
He emerges, quietly locking the door behind him.
Two tethered horses can be seen in deep b.g., and another gust of LAUGHTER can be heard from the nearby guard room.
Taylor looks off.
As already established, the animal compound is situated on the outskirts of the apes' community.
The strange skyline of the town can be seen in the distance.
He starts to cross an open field outside the compound.
At that moment we HEAR a shrill police WHISTLE from the guard room.
Taylor breaks into a run.
As the two gorilla officers emerge from the building and run toward their horses.
He runs down the road, starts across the long causeway that bisects a small lake, looking over his shoulder.
The community we sue at the end of the causeway is small and arcane.
There are no power lines, no street lamps -- indeed, no streets as such, but only a small cluster of buildings around a pleasant mall.
The architecture of the buildings is faintly derivative of the simpler and less rococo work of Antonio Gaudi -- columns and pillars of brick or exterior masonry look like the trunks and branches of great trees and suggest an arboreal past.
A small number of apes are visible on the mall:
Taylor darts behind the buttress of a building, casing the situation.
He looks back at:
The two mounted gorilla-police can be seen on the causeway, galloping straight toward CAMERA.
It is evident they will soon spot Taylor.
He retreats from the buttress to a dark archway and vanishes inside the building.
The vestibule is nothing, no set required, a dark space through which Taylor moves toward a shaft of light.
We HEAR faintly the discordant chords of an organ.
Or is it an organ?
At any rate,a strange and melancholy tune.
Taylor arrives at a font.
He appears out of darkness into half-light.
The rear of the temple is obscure.
Taylor darts behind a screen.
Crouching there, he observes:
The temple itself is small and austere.
There is no altar, but against a plain backdrop we see a statue of the Lawgiver, a Great Ape holding a book.
Below the Lawgiver is an ORANGUTAN MINISTER clothed in black robes.
He stands in front of a closed coffin.
A dozen mourners, seated on comfortable wicker chairs, form a semi-circle around the coffin.
The ape ladies wear cowls.
MINISTER Weep if you must, but make an end of sorrow.
MINISTER He lives again.
MINISTER Yes, he has found peace in Heaven.
Crouching, listening, wide-eyed.
MINISTER He was a model for us all, a gorilla to remember; hunter, warrior, defender of the Faith.
As the minister continues his eulogy, a small ape boy detaches himself (as children will) from the group of mourners and comes marching up the aisle toward the rear of the temple.
MINISTER Cherished husband, beloved father, generous master -- yes, he was a font of simian kindness.
Who is still crouching behind the screen in deep b.g.
The small fry is coming closer.
Over this we hear:
The dear departed once said to me: 'I never met an ape I didn't like'...
The small fry spots Taylor.
CHILD Look!.
CHILD It's a man!
CHILD The mourners' heads turn.
CHILD Taylor slinks toward the vestibule.
He is aghast.
MINISTER In Heaven's name ...
MINISTER Get rid of that creature.
MINISTER Two ushers rise, moving past CAMERA and o.s.
Staying close on the temple wall, Taylor moves stealthily away from the vestibule door.
The two ape ushers appear.
There he is:
They move toward Taylor.
He runs out onto the mall.
Taylor belatedly sees that he is running straight toward his two mounted pursuers.
Darting off in another direction, he races past startled pedestrians.
They do a slow take.
FIRST CHIMP You see what I saw?
SECOND CHIMP Must've escaped from the zoo.
He has spotted Taylor.
Drawing a folded net from his saddlebag, he swings it overhead (like a cowboy with a lariat) and gallops off in pursuit of the man.
231
Taylor runs frantically from building to building, rounding corners, vanishing momentarily and reappearing on another part of the mall.
At one point the mountie nearly overtakes him and flings his net, which falls short.
Taylor runs on.
It is an open-air structure, like a Greek theater, located near the central mail.
Steeply tiered, it seats no more than fifty apes.
The dais in the pit is some fifteen feet above ground level.
Taylor enters scene, running toward the amphitheater.
Changing direction, he darts into what appears to be an access tunnel.
A moment later the pursuing cop rides into' scene, dismounts and walks toward the amphitheater, looking around for Taylor.
Taylor suddenly emerges from the access tunnel and runs up a ramp encircling the amphitheater.
(A retaining wall shields him from the view of the apes.)
Pausing for breath at the top of the ramp, Taylor crouches behind the uppermost tier of seats and peers down:
THE AMPHITHEATER - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V. The cop looks around, spots Taylor at the top tier, and starts up after him.
237
He starts to run back down the ramp, but is suddenly confronted by his original pursuer (the dismounted cop coming up the ramp.
Reversing direction, Taylor runs around the rim of the amphitheater and vanishes into an exit tunnel.
The cop blows his whistle, summoning another cop, who joins him in the chase.
244
In which we see the fugitive, his pursuers and the reactions of ape shoppers and workers.
248
A market has been set up on one side of the mall, where street vendors behind carts or tables hawk their wares: fruits, vegetables, wearing apparel, etc.
As Taylor runs frantically through the market place, several apes join the chase.
In the ensuing pandemonium, like the proverbial Chinese fire drill, several tables are overturned.
Taylor runs into scene, pauses, panting, and looks back at his pursuers.
Then he darts through the archway into the building.
For the moment he is the sole visitor in this wing.
His pace slows to a walk as he and we observe fleetingly the specimens in what is a simian museum: Possibly several stuffed and unfamiliar animals; primitive artifacts and fossils; possibly the skeleton of a dog, a cat, etc.
Over this we hear a shrill police WHISTLE.
He runs again.
Looking at the stuffed animals as Taylor races past.
The mother gives a startled SCREAM.
He starts after the fugitive.
He runs past displays of other stuffed animals toward CAMERA and halts abruptly in close f.g., shocked by:
255	WHAT HE SEES: 	DODGE stuffed and mounted, Dodge bares his teeth at the world.
Reacting in horror.
He hears another police WHISTLE and the echoing FOOTSTEPS of approaching guards, which mufffle his strangled gasp:
TAYLOR Dodge ...
TAYLOR Taylor vanishes in a BLUR of movement.
Order has been restored in the open-air market.
Taylor bursts suddenly into view from a building on the far side of the mall, running in panic from ape guards in close pursuit.
A mounted policeman spots him and heads him off.
Changing direction, Taylor is intercepted by another mounted Gorilla.
And then a third.
CAMERA HOLDS, ANGLING DOWN on the center of the mall.
We are witnessing a hideous game: "baiting the man."
The mounted police do not shoot or club Taylor, for he cannot escape -- but they circle him, their long whips CRACKING over his head.
258	CLOSER ANGLE - THE CIRCLE AROUND TAYLOR - FAVORING A MOUNTIE who unfolds his net, swings it overhead and flings it at Taylor.
This time he bags his quarry.
Taylor gives up.
Spent, docile, entangled in the net, he stands stock-still in the center of the mall.
Guards and civillians on foot join the circle around the man at bay.
They regard him warily.
She pushes through the simian crowd around Taylor and hurries to his side.
She paws at the net, crying impulsively:
ZIRA Taylor, why'd you run away?
ZIRA Zira removes the net from his face.
ZIRA Panting with exhaustion, Taylor flicks a wild glance at her.
ZIRA He looks demented.
261	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TWO GORILLA OFFICERS who approach Taylor and Zira.
(They are the same gorillas introduced in Scene 198.)
One of them carries a collar and leash.
The other presents an I.D. card to Zira.
LIEUTENANT Security police.
ZIRA I'm in charge of this man.
LIEUTENANT No longer, madame.
LIEUTENANT He is now in the custody of the Ministry of Science.
LIEUTENANT His colleague moves toward Taylor with a muzzle.
He speaks at last, his voice hoarse but audible.
TAYLOR Get away from me, you dirty ape!
The arresting officer steps back involuntarily.
All the apes freeze, staring at the speaking animal with mute astonishment as we:
The compound is dimly lit.
Taylor, the bandage now gone from his throat, is back in his old cage.
The other cages, however, are empty -- their occupants presumably having been moved to the surgery or the zoo.
He is seated on a pile of straw in the rear corner, Nova's head cradled on his lap.
Idly he strokes her coarse hair.
There is a dull glow of madness in his eyes, and his manner is one of abstract soliloquy, like a man talking to a dog.
TAYLOR ...and that's when I decided to take up astronautical engineering., you see.
TAYLOR I was halfway through college and I...
TAYLOR It's an old trick!
TAYLOR The silent treatment.
TAYLOR Four weeks and three days, and not a word from anyone.
TAYLOR Not Zira.,or Cornelius...or that damn Julius.
TAYLOR No one'll listen...
TAYLOR only you.
TAYLOR You...Nova.
TAYLOR NO-VAH.
TAYLOR His manner is now more direct, and educative., but she stares in blank comprehension.
TAYLOR She brushes his moving lips with her fingers.
TAYLOR He shrugs wryly.
TAYLOR Yeah...me Tarzan, you Jane.
TAYLOR That's all right ...
TAYLOR I had a puppy once that never barked.
TAYLOR He just licked my hand.
TAYLOR He's dead now.
TAYLOR They're all dead.
TAYLOR Everything...
TAYLOR I think maybe they'll kill me, too.
TAYLOR Are they afraid of me?
TAYLOR I can't hurt them...
TAYLOR but I threaten them somehow.
TAYLOR Threaten their faith in simian superiority.
TAYLOR Yeah ...
TAYLOR you're right.
TAYLOR They'll have to kill me.
TAYLOR Faint footsteps are heard o.s.
TAYLOR Taylor and Nova look in the direction of the sound.
TAYLOR A sudden stream of water shoots through the bars and strikes Taylor in the chest.
An ape GUARD has a high pressure hose trained on Taylor.
It forces him back toward the rear of the cage.
Julius, whip in hand, unlocks the cage, steps inside.
He unlimbers the whip., cracks it-'in Nova's direction.
She recoils.
The jet of water hold Taylor at bay.
Julius grabs Nova, begins to pull her toward the door of the cage.
Taylor tries to fight his way through the water toward Julius.
TAYLOR Let her alone!
TAYLOR Julius swings the whip.
TAYLOR It cracks against Taylor's legs, biting into the skin.
TAYLOR Taylor stumbles, falls to one knee
TAYLOR Where are you taking her?
TAYLOR What are you going to do?
TAYLOR Julius drags and pushes the girl through the door, slamming and locking it behind him.
TAYLOR Taylor, fights through the stream of water, flings himself against the bars.
TAYLOR Take your hands off her, you black monster!
TAYLOR You filth!
TAYLOR Julius shoves Nova across the aisle to a cage opposite Taylor's, locks her inside.
TAYLOR Why are you doing this?
TAYLOR Say something, you hairy scum!
TAYLOR Julius gestures toward the ape guard
JULIUS Turn it off!
JULIUS The ape guard shuts off the hose.
TAYLOR Answer me!
TAYLOR Julius strides over to Taylor's cage.
JULIUS Shut up!
JULIUS The reason no one'll talk to you is because you're a freak!
TAYLOR Where's Dr. Zira?
TAYLOR Why--?
JULIUS I said shut up!
JULIUS He slashes viciously with his whip handle against Taylor's fingers.
JULIUS Taylor yells in pain.
JULIUS Julius and the ape guard start out of the compound.
TAYLOR Ape!
TAYLOR Apes wearing clothes!
TAYLOR It's a madhouse!
TAYLOR A madhouse!
TAYLOR He sinks to the floor as the apes go out.
Taylor looks desolately through the bars across to Nova's cage.
She eyes him sadly.
TAYLOR Now I don't even have you.
TAYLOR Imagine me -- needing someone.
TAYLOR Back on Earth there was nobody.
TAYLOR Women, yes.
TAYLOR Lots of them.
TAYLOR Love making ithout love.
TAYLOR That's the kind of world it was turning into, with the help of cynics like myself.
TAYLOR So I left it -- because there was no one dear enough to keep me there.
TAYLOR Did I tell you about Stewart?
TAYLOR There was a lovely girl.
TAYLOR The most precious cargo we brought along.
TAYLOR If human life could survive here, she was to be the new Eve.
TAYLOR It's probably just as well she didn't live to see this.
TAYLOR He looks at Nova.
TAYLOR She stretches her hands through the bars toward him.
TAYLOR I wonder if it's Love between us.
TAYLOR What a place to find it.
Two gorilla officers enter, carrying torches.
(These are the same apes introduced in Scene 198.)
One carries a double set of manacles.
Julius comes to meet them.
The Lieutenant takes the two sets of manacles from the other officer, hands them to Julius, whispers something.
Julius comes over and unlocks the door of Taylor's cage.
He advances to Taylor, who does not move, bends down and clamps the manacles around each of his ankles.
Then he straightens, lifts Taylor's arms, pulls his wrists together, snaps on the cuffs.
Taylor looks across at Nova, blows her a kiss.
Julius leads him out of the cage, takes his leash from a snaps it onto Taylor's collar, hands the other end to the Lieutenant.
Nova and Julius watch in silence as Taylor is led down the aisle and out the door.
272
Taylor, wearing his manacles, is seated at a table in the otherwise deserted chamber.
There is an empty chair on either side of him.
Across the room stands a dais with three rude, high-backed chairs.
There is a small table directly below the dais.
A third table stands at right angles to the dais.
Taylor looks around the empty room.
A door is opened by a gorilla BAILIFF, and Zira and Cornelius come into the room, sit down on each side of Taylor.
A moment later, DR.HONORIUS, the Prosecutor and a CLERK enter, take their seats at the third table.
TAYLOR Where have you been?
TAYLOR Why didn't you come to see me?
ZIRA Shhhh!
TAYLOR What is this?
ZIRA A hearing.
CORNELIUS Be clever.
CORNELIUS Be quiet,
BAILIFF All rise!
BAILIFF Everyone gets up as THE PRESIDENT, Dr. Zaius and Dr. Maximus enter and mount the dais.
BAILIFF The President takes the center chair; the other two flanking him.
BAILIFF Be seated.
BAILIFF All sit down.
PRESIDENT This ad hoc Tribunal of the National Academy is now in session.
PRESIDENT President of the Academy presiding.
PRESIDENT On my right, Dr.
PRESIDENT Maximus, Commissioner for Animal Affairs.
PRESIDENT On my left, Dr. Zaius, Minister of Science and Chief Defender of the Faith...
PRESIDENT Appearing for the State, Dr. Honorius, Deputy Minister of Justice.
PRESIDENT Honorius rises and bows.
PRESIDENT Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.
PRESIDENT You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
ZIRA By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
ZIRA The President appears to be taken aback.
ZIRA He glances at his colleagues.
MAXIMUS You asked for the opportunity to present your case.
MAXIMUS Surely you must know why you're here.
ZIRA My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
MAXIMUS And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
ZIRA At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
HONORIUS Objection.
HONORIUS The accused is indeed a man.
HONORIUS Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
PRESIDENT Well, Dr. Zira?
PRESIDENT This is a man, is he not?
Sensing that the President has given them an opening, Zira smiles confidently.
ZIRA He is unlike any man you have ever seen - as we hope to prove.
ZIRA Answer the question.
ZIRA Is he a man?
Sir?
The question is the point at issue: Is he a man?
Or a deviate?
Or a freak of nature?
CORNELIUS Objection!
As the Prosecutor continues:
PRESIDENT Sustained.
PRESIDENT In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
ZIRA Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
ZIRA Honorius seems confounded.
ZIRA Zaius takes over.
ZAIUS This man is not being tried.
ZAIUS He is being disposed of.
ZAIUS It is scientific heresy that is actually on trial here.
MAXIMUS Well put, Dr. Zaius.
MAXIMUS Let us warn our friends that they endanger their own careers by defending this animal.
Both Cornelius and Zira appear shaken by this threat.
Sensing their predicament, Taylor rises impatiently.
TAYLOR Then I'll defend myself.
Although the judges and Prosecutor have been told that this man can speak, they react in stunned silence to the first sound of his voice.
Flustered, the President bangs his gavel.
PRESIDENT Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
TAYLOR My name is Taylor.
TAYLOR The President refuses to address Taylor directly.
TAYLOR Checking a document, he speaks to Zira.
PRESIDENT It says here that his name is Bright Eyes.
PRESIDENT You gave him that name yourself.
TAYLOR This hearing is absurd!
TAYLOR Let me tell my story...
PRESIDENT Bailiff!
PRESIDENT Make the animal be quiet.
PRESIDENT The Bailiff quickly crosses to Taylor and shoves him roughly into his chair.
PRESIDENT State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
HONORIUS Learned Judges: My case is simple.
HONORIUS It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Taylor has begun to write something on a sheet of paper.
Zira and Cornelius remain attentive to:
HONORIUS These sacred truths are self-evident.
HONORIUS The proper study of apes is apes.
HONORIUS But certain young cynics have chosen to study man - yes, perverted scientists who advance on insidious theory called 'evolution.'
As the Prosecutor continues:
HONORIUS There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
PRESIDENT Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
HONORIUS Directly, Mr. President.
HONORIUS This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy.
HONORIUS We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture.
HONORIUS The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
ZIRA ThatOs a lie!
PRESIDENT Mind your tongue, madame.
ZIRA Did we create his mind too?
ZIRA Not only can this man speak.
ZIRA He can write.
ZIRA He can reason.
HONORIUS He can reason?
HONORIUS With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
PRESIDENT Proceed.
PRESIDENT But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
PRESIDENT Honorius crosses to the defendant's table and favors Taylor with an evil smile.
HONORIUS Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
TAYLOR I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
HONORIUS Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.
HONORIUS Tell us why all apes are created equal.
TAYLOR Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
HONORIUS Ridiculous.
HONORIUS That answer is a contradiction in terms.
HONORIUS Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls?
HONORIUS What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
TAYLOR Show this to the President.
TAYLOR Zira moves toward the dais.
TAYLOR Honorius returns to his own table.
ZIRA Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
PRESIDENT Read it yourself.
ZIRA 'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system.
ZIRA I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization.
ZIRA On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
PRESIDENT Stop right there.
PRESIDENT Bring me that paper.
PRESIDENT Zira crosses to the dais, handing the statement to the President.
PRESIDENT He glances at it, laughs derisively and passes it to Zaius.
PRESIDENT This is a joke in very poor taste.
ZIRA Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
ZAIUS Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
ZIRA I do not state it, sir.
ZIRA The prisoner does.
ZAIUS Do you believe him?
ZIRA Like you, I find it difficult.
ZAIUS But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?
ZAIUS You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
ZIRA This is his assertion.
ZAIUS Where are they now?
TAYLOR One is in a museum!
PRESIDENT Dr. Zira!
PRESIDENT Silence that man!
PRESIDENT Returning to her table, Zira gestures to Taylor to remain silent.
ZAIUS How sad.
ZAIUS Stuffed and mounted, eh?
ZAIUS Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories.
ZAIUS And his other companion?
ZIRA He doesn't know.
ZAIUS Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
HONORIUS That's true, Dr. Zaius.
HONORIUS My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
PRESIDENT Very well.
PRESIDENT I suggest we go and look at them.
PRESIDENT The President rises, starts out, followed by the others.
PRESIDENT Taylor is last, being led on a leash by the bailiff.
The inquiry group files through a door into the amphitheater.
Two APES stand guard over a number of leashed and nearly naked human beings in the center of the pit below the dais.
There are three primitive males, the female Nova -- and Landon.
He is dirty and bearded, but his hair is cropped close.
He turns to Zira, his eyes shining with vindication.
TAYLOR It's him...Landon.
ZIRA Which one?
TAYLOR Second from the left.
Zaius glances at the accused.
ZAIUS Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
TAYLOR With one of them.
ZAIUS Identify him, then.
ZAIUS Speak to him.
ZAIUS Taylor moves forward for a few paces, stops.
TAYLOR Landon?
Landon looks catatonic.
His face is in shadow
Stunned by Landon's imbecility.
TAYLOR John ...
TAYLOR it's me, Taylor.
TAYLOR Taylor steps forward to grasp his arm.
TAYLOR There is still no response.
TAYLOR Taylor takes Landon's head in his hands and looks at his face.
TAYLOR There is a fresh scar running from his forehead to the top of his cranium.
As Taylor whirls on Zira.
TAYLOR You!
TAYLOR ...
TAYLOR You knew about this?
ZIRA No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
TAYLOR You did this to him!
TAYLOR You've removed his frontal lobes!
PRESIDENT Silence!
PRESIDENT Bailiff, take the prisoner inside!
PRESIDENT The bailiff Jerks brutally on Taylor's leash, pulling him toward the door leading under the amphitheater.
The bailiff enters, dragging Taylor behind him, shoves him into his chair.
Moments later the other apes enter the room.
All take their seats but Zaius.
Taylor glares at him furiously.
ZAIUS Mr. President, a word of explanation: the creature in question suffered a skull fracture during the hunt.
ZAIUS Two fine veternary surgeons under my direction were able to save his life.
ZAIUS But the beast could not speak, of course.
ZAIUS Nor will he ever speak
ZAIUS Taylor leaps from his chair, livid with rage, approaches the dais.
TAYLOR You destroyed his memory!
TAYLOR His mind!
TAYLOR His identity!
TAYLOR And, you want to do the same to me!
PRESIDENT Bailiff!
PRESIDENT Stop this outburst!
PRESIDENT Gag that monstrosity!
The bailiff and a husky guard seize Taylor, who continues shouting:
TAYLOR You barbarians!
TAYLOR The powerful guard twists Taylor's arms behind his back and the bailiff lashes his wrists together.
TAYLOR Then the bailiff gags Taylor.
TAYLOR His voice is cut off as the bailiff ties the twisted kerchief around his open mouth.
TAYLOR The guard holds Taylor's leash during the rest of this scene.
TAYLOR Meanwhile, Cornelius has risen to his feet.
TAYLOR His tone is firm, but conciliatory.
CORNELIUS May it please the Tribunal: I for one grant that this being cannot have come from another planet.
CORNELIUS But this much is certain -- he comes from somewhere in the Forbidden Zone.
CORNELIUS He has described the region to us, and described it accurately, for I have been there.
PRESIDENT You visited the Forbidden Zone?
CORNELIUS Why, yes, sir.
CORNELIUS A year ago.
CORNELIUS With the special permission of the Academy.
ZAIUS He exceeded his orders.
ZAIUS His travel permit was promptly revoked.
CORNELIUS Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you.
CORNELIUS But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
HONORIUS Objection!
HONORIUS These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
PRESIDENT Sustained.
PRESIDENT Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
ZAIUS Let them talk, Mr President.
ZAIUS Let them talk.
ZIRA Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
PRESIDENT How so?
ZIRA Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false.
ZIRA But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own.
ZIRA Yes, sprang.
ZIRA As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
HONORIUS Objection!
PRESIDENT Sustained.
ZIRA Their speech organs are adequate.
ZIRA The flaw lies not in anatomy but in the brain.
HONORIUS Objection!
PRESIDENT Sustained.
ZIRA Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
ZIRA Cornelius has regained his courage.
ZIRA Rising to Zira's support, he points at Taylor.
CORNELIUS Yes!
CORNELIUS Behold this marvel, this living paradox, this missing link in an evolutionary chain!
PRESIDENT Silence!
PRESIDENT You have gone too far.
ZAIUS There you are, Mr. President.
ZAIUS I warned you these two would use this hearing as a forum for subversion.
MAXIMUS You were right!
MAXIMUS The advocates of heresy have revealed themselves.
ZAIUS Mr. President, I think an indictment is in order.
HONORIUS Yes, sir.
HONORIUS The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
PRESIDENT Be it so ordered.
PRESIDENT The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.
PRESIDENT This hearing is adjourned.
PRESIDENT All rise.
PRESIDENT The guard drags Taylor from the inquiry room.
PRESIDENT Zira and Cornelius stand there, stunned by the entrapment into which Zaius has maneuvered them.
The office is as unadorned and Spartan as that of Cornelius -- in fact, with minor changes in decor, the same set can be used.
There are many thick leatherbound books on this scholar's desk.
Zaius is reading one of them and taking notes.
He looks up as someone KNOCKS at the door.
The two agents push Taylor through the doorway.
ZAIUS Wait outside.
ZAIUS The officers withdraw, closing the door.
ZAIUS Collared, wrists manacled, Taylor stands facing the desk.
ZAIUS The verdict is in.
ZAIUS At the moment your simian friends -- and sponsors -- are free on bail.
ZAIUS But they'll soon be brought to trial for heresy.
292	ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING ZAIUS who falls silent, as if this were the only news of import.
We note at once a change In Zaius' tone and attitude.
He no longer treats Taylor like a freak animal, but addresses him as an imaginative adversary who must be intimidated by the threat of terror.
TAYLOR What about me?
ZAIUS Oh, your case was preordained.
ZAIUS In a way, you performed a service for the State ...
ZAIUS Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.
ZAIUS And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition.
ZAIUS Do you know what that means?
TAYLOR No.
ZAIUS Emasculation, to begin with.
ZAIUS Then experimental surgery.
ZAIUS On the speech centers.
ZAIUS On the brain.
ZAIUS Ultimately, a kind of living death.
ZAIUS Taylor stiffens but says nothing.
ZAIUS Zaius lets this prospect sink in, then continues.
ZAIUS However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.
ZAIUS That is why I summoned you here tonight.
ZAIUS Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
TAYLOR I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
ZAIUS You lied.
ZAIUS Where is your tribe?
TAYLOR My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
ZAIUS Then how is it we speak the same language?
ZAIUS Even in your lies, some truth slips through!
ZAIUS That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
TAYLOR What about it?
ZAIUS A fort!
ZAIUS Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.
ZAIUS Where were you nurtured?
TAYLOR I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
ZAIUS Certainly not.
ZAIUS You're a mutant.
TAYLOR That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim.
TAYLOR You're talking heresy, doctor.
ZAIUS Of course.
TAYLOR All right, suppose I am a mutant?
TAYLOR Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
ZAIUS Because you're not unique.
ZAIUS There was the one you call Landon --
TAYLOR Then you admit --
ZAIUS I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another.
ZAIUS And another.
ZAIUS A nest of them.
ZAIUS Where's your nest, Taylor?
ZAIUS Where are your women?
TAYLOR Thank you for calling me Taylor.
TAYLOR Dr. Zaius, I know who I am.
TAYLOR Who are you?
TAYLOR How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
ZAIUS You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level.
ZAIUS And deservedly.
ZAIUS The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.
ZAIUS Save yourself, Taylor.
ZAIUS Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
TAYLOR I don't know.
ZAIUS If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
TAYLOR I'm not protecting anybody!
TAYLOR That hearing was a farce.
TAYLOR What have I done?
ZAIUS You're a menace!
ZAIUS A walking pestilence.
ZAIUS I do know who you are, Taylor.
ZAIUS As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.
ZAIUS You have just six hours to make a full confession.
ZAIUS After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.
ZAIUS Guards!
ZAIUS The two burly security agents open the door and enter.
ZAIUS Take this creature back to his cage.
ZAIUS The guards seize Taylor, start to shove him toward the doorway.
ZAIUS He twists around, faces Zaius.
TAYLOR All right, you can cut me to pieces.
TAYLOR It's within your power.
TAYLOR But know this, doctor.
TAYLOR You do it because you're afraid of me.
TAYLOR You do it from fear!
TAYLOR Zaius jerks his head silently toward the door.
TAYLOR The apes drag Taylor through it.
A few hours have passed.
Nova is watching Taylor from her cage across the aisle.
He sits on the pile of straw.
There is an ugly welt on his cheek made by the security officer's whip.
FOOTSTEPS are heard.
Taylor and Nova look up and off.
A solemn, teen-age chimp named LUCIUS appears outside the cage.
The guard Julius rises from his chair.
LUCIUS Are you Julius?
JULIUS What do you want?
LUCIUS I'm from the Office of Animal Affairs.
LUCIUS This male's to be transferred to the zoo.
JULIUS At this hour?
JULIUS Who says so?
JULIUS Taylor enters scene, coming over to the cage bars as Lucius continues gravely, with just a note of disdain.
LUCIUS Don't they tell you anything?
LUCIUS The Anti- vivisectionist Society is up in arms.
LUCIUS They're going to save this beast from those butchers in the lab.
LUCIUS If he can speak he belongs in the public zoo.
LUCIUS But what'll probably happen is that some money-mad grown-up will put him in a circus.
LUCIUS And then we'll have to pay to see what rightfully should have --
JULIUS Stop making speeches and show me the order.
JULIUS Lucius hands the guard a document.
JULIUS It is dark here, so Julius crosses to a beam of light near the bars and studies the document.
JULIUS Lucius, behind the guard's back, signals frantically for Taylor to seize or strike the guard.
JULIUS Taylor is slow to understand.
JULIUS Lucius shakes his head impatiently.
JULIUS This order's no good.
JULIUS It must be counter- signed by Dr. Zaius --
JULIUS Lucius suddenly gives Julius a violent shove.
JULIUS The guard's head crashes against the bars and he is stunned.
LUCIUS Hit him!
LUCIUS Taylor complies bringing down the heel of his fist on the nape of the guard's neck.
LUCIUS Julius collapses.
LUCIUS The youngster immediately squats down, gags him, and begins to bind him hand and foot.
LUCIUS CAMERA MOVES IN.
TAYLOR Who are you?
LUCIUS So you can talk.
LUCIUS I'm Dr. Zira's nephew.
LUCIUS This abduction was her idea.
LUCIUS You're not really going to the zoo.
LUCIUS That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.
LUCIUS Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
TAYLOR Come on.
TAYLOR Get me out of here.
TAYLOR Taking the guard's keys, Lucius rises and unlocks the cage.
TAYLOR Nova enters the scene, coming to the bars of her cage.
He gazes at her, tense with indecision.
She flashes an imploring smile, a mute appeal that cannot be denied.
Over this we hear:
TAYLOR We've got to move fast.
296	WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE LUCIUS as Taylor leaves his cage.
TAYLOR She comes along too.
LUCIUS Zira doesn't want your female.
TAYLOR I want her.
LUCIUS If you insist.
LUCIUS But I'm not taking any orders --
TAYLOR Fine.
TAYLOR Just let her out.
TAYLOR Lucius unlocks Nova's cage.
TAYLOR She comes out quickly, takes Taylor's hand.
TAYLOR They follow Lucius out of the compound.
A horse-drawn caged wagon (like that used in the hunt) stands near the building.
Zira waits at the rear of the wagon.
Lucius, Taylor and Nova emerge from a doorway or archway and join her.
Zira notes Nova's presence with disapproval.
They speak in undertones.
ZIRA I told you not to bring the other one.
LUCIUS He wouldn't leave her.
ZIRA All right...
ZIRA Get in...hurry.
ZIRA Put this on.
TAYLOR Listen-
ZIRA Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this.
ZIRA Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
ZIRA Taylor and Nova comply, climbing into the cage.
ZIRA Lucius closes the tailgate.
ZIRA Lucius and Zira move to the front of the wagon and climb
aboard.
Lucius takes the reins.
As they move off:
As previously established, the animal compound is on the outskirts of Apetown.
The abductors must cross the causeway on their route of escape.
In the distance, near the gazebo, we can see the lights of several torches.
The caged wagon rolls into scene and out onto the causeway.
At the same time a mounted gorilla leading two pack animals appears on the far side of the causeway, coming toward CAMERA.
Lucius stops the wagon.
LUCIUS Gorilla hunters ...
ZIRA Keep moving.
ZIRA We can't turn back now.
As the mounted hunter nears the wagon, we can see two bodies slung across the backs of the pack animals.
They look out at:
The bodies on the horses are naked human corpses.
In immediate f.g., near the gazebo, is a similar wagon.
It has lost a wheel, and its rear axle lies on the edge of the causeway.
Two naked primitive males can be dimly seen within the cage.
Four or five armed gorilla hunters stand near the wagon: two of them carry torches; the others are passing a jug from hand to hand-.
The leader of the Hunt Club, still on horseback, holds up his hand as the lab wagon approaches.
LEADER Hold it!
LEADER Lucius obeys.
LEADER The hunters on foot swarm around his wagon as their
leader calls authoritatively:
LEADER Ah, Doctor Zira!
LEADER Our wagon broke down!
LEADER I'm afraid we'll have to commandeer yours.
304	CLOSER ANGLE - THE LAB WAGON as the Hunt Club Leader rides over, recognizing the animal psychologist.
ZIRA You can't!
ZIRA I've two sick humans in the cage.
ZIRA We're taking them to the chief vet at the zoo ...
LEADER We bagged two live ones today.
LEADER I'll have to ask you to take them along.
LEADER He moves to the rear of the wagon.
ZIRA No, no, my animals are diseased...
ZIRA Leave them alone!
ZIRA They're diseased, I tell you!
ZIRA Lucius jumps down and runs toward the rear of the wagon.
The hunters have opened the tailgate and are shining their torches on the humans.
They sound ready for sport.
FIRST HUNTER Give him a taste of fire!
FIRST HUNTER One of the hunters points his torch at Taylor, who, quite naturally, shrinks back as Lucius runs into scene.
LUCIUS Stand back!
LUCIUS He's dangerous!
FIRST HUNTER Why?
ZIRA He's rabid!
ZIRA His bite is fatal!
FIRST HUNTER You serious?
LUCIUS You would die in agony!
LUCIUS Frothing at the mouth!
LUCIUS The hunters fall back.
LUCIUS Lucius promptly locks the tailgate and he and Zira run back to the front of the wagon.
LUCIUS Lucius snaps the reins and the wagon moves off.
LUCIUS The hunters follow it a few paces, pausing near their mounted leader.
FIRST HUNTER They treat those animals better than they treat us.
LEADER I still say the only good human is a dead human.
The fugitives' wagon recedes beyond the gazebo, as we:
The horse-drawn wagon is silhouetted-against the dawn light, bumping across a semi-arid plain studded with mesquite and sage.
(This SCENE can be SHOT either on the Navajo reservation near Page or on the Ranch).
This is the same area described on page 24, where the hunt occurred.
As the wagon rolls along a dirt track, the tall grasses of the savanna (or cultivated field) can be seen in b.g.
Taylor is dozing, but the girl is alert and nervous.
She peers out at the field, apparently recognizing or remembering this terrain.
She nudges Taylor, waking him.
This, too, is the location described on page 24.
CAMERA PANS with the wagon as it rolls into the grove and HOLDS on three horses.
Cornelius sits astride one horse; the other two nags are heavily burdened with packs and saddlebags.
He dismounts as Zira and Lucius jump down from the wagon and hurry toward him.
Cornelius and his fiancee embrace and kiss lightly, ape-fashion.
CORNELIUS How did it go?
ZIRA There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
LUCIUS I pursuaded them our beasts had rabies.
The apes discussing the abduction are out of earshot.
Exasperated to be thus ignored and caged, Taylor kicks the tailgate, shouting:
TAYLOR Let me out of here!
Lucius hurries back to unlock the tailgate.
Taylor gets out of the wagon, stretching his stiffened joints.
Nova follows suit.
During the ensuing exchange the girl seems strangely agitated, pacing to and fro, her eyes scanning the grove and fields in search of someone or something.
CORNELIUS Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
TAYLOR Do you have any weapons?
CORNELIUS The best.
CORNELIUS But we won't need them.
TAYLOR Just the same, I want one.
TAYLOR He moves toward one of the horses.
TAYLOR Cornelius starts after him.
CORNELIUS Look here, Taylor.
CORNELIUS I'm in charge of this expedition --
CORNELIUS Taylor takes a rifle from one of the packs, examines it.
TAYLOR Fair enough.
TAYLOR But you're no longer in charge of me.
TAYLOR And I don't mean to be captured again.
TAYLOR Zira and Lucius have come up.
CORNELIUS As you wish.
TAYLOR Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone.
TAYLOR That's what we'll try for.
TAYLOR What about you?
ZIRA Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy.
ZIRA Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
TAYLOR You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
CORNELIUS To the diggings I worked at a year ago.
CORNELIUS It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
TAYLOR You still don't believe me, do you?
CORNELIUS It's a long detour to Dead Lake.
CORNELIUS What would we find?
CORNELIUS Taylor makes a helpless gesture, realizing that he cannot present sure proof.
TAYLOR Nothing much.
TAYLOR The remnants of a life raft.
TAYLOR Maybe a small flag.
TAYLOR The emblem of my countrymen.
CORNELIUS Sorry, Taylor.
CORNELIUS The terrain around that lake is poisonous.
CORNELIUS There is no fresh water, no vegetation.
CORNELIUS Nothing.
TAYLOR I know ...
TAYLOR Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us.
TAYLOR You'll be in trouble for going there.
ZIRA We've been in trouble since the moment we met you.
ZIRA Nova seizes Taylor's arm to get his attention.
ZIRA Trying to communicate,
she makes whimpering sounds and points at:
This is the same view of the jungle that Taylor saw when the gorilla hunters emerged from the trees.
(Page 25)
ZIRA What's she pointing at?
Taylor smiles at Nova, gives her a reassuring shrug.
TAYLOR That's the way home.
TAYLOR And she knows it.
TAYLOR Nova turns away, still holding Taylor's arm, tries to lead him toward the jungle.
TAYLOR Nova!
TAYLOR We can't stay there.
TAYLOR It's not safe.
TAYLOR She looks at him sadly.
ZIRA We'd better get started.
ZIRA If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
CORNELIUS Right.
CORNELIUS Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
CORNELIUS He and Lucius move off toward the horses.
ZIRA Are you going to take her with you?
TAYLOR Yes.
ZIRA Actually, you're a different breed.
ZIRA This creature will never evolve.
TAYLOR Maybe not.
ZIRA You want her that much?
TAYLOR You threw us together, remember?
TAYLOR And you guessed right.
TAYLOR Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
TAYLOR He walks off to help Lucius and Cornelius.
TAYLOR Nova tags along behind him
as we:
The caravan is crossing, in a reverse direction, the route taken by the astronauts on page 17.
The three apes are on horseback.
Taylor and Nova follow in the wagon.
They are nearing the row of sinister scarecrows on the bluff above the dry wash.
They halt briefly and look up at the crosses.
Lucius is impressed.
LUCIUS Who put them up?
ZIRA The Hunt Club.
LUCIUS To scare off humans?
CORNELIUS To scare us, too.
CORNELIUS We're entering the Forbidden Zone.
CORNELIUS They move off again, riding across the dry wash.
They, too, have stopped and are looking up at the scarecrows.
Nova is plainly terrified.
She grabs Taylor's arm, whimpers.
TAYLOR Don't worry.
TAYLOR You'll be safe with me.
TAYLOR Here.
TAYLOR It's time you learned to earn your keep.
TAYLOR He hands the reins to Nova.
TAYLOR She just sits there.
TAYLOR He demonstrates.
TAYLOR You can do it.
TAYLOR Like this ...
TAYLOR Nova flicks the reins, reacting in wide-eyed, open-mouthed disbelief as the horse obeys her.
The party is traversing a red desert to the east of Dead Lake.
Great sandstone monoliths rise from the desert floor.
From this vantage point the horses look no bigger than ants.
This is terrain never before seen in this picture.
(Lake Powell location, a few miles northeast of Wahweap).
The party can be seen on the rim of a flat desert tableland that falls away abruptly to a vast, irregular river of deep blue water.
Taylor, Cornelius and Lucius are unloading the wagon and repacking their provisions and equipment on the backs of horses.
Zira watches them.
Zira wanders off, falls to her knees.
LUCIUS Something's wrong with your mate.
LUCIUS Taylor looks off.
LUCIUS He and the others move quickly to Nova, CAMERA PANNING with them.
She has been retching.
Taylor lifts her up.
She is faint with nausea.
Zira squats down beside them.
ZIRA Let me handle this.
ZIRA You may be smarter than I am, but I'm the veterinary on this planet.
ZIRA Assisting Nova to her feet, Zira leads her off toward the wagon.
Taylor watches the departing females, then looks down at the river.
TAYLOR Where does the river lead?
CORNELIUS It empties into a sea some miles from here.
CORNELIUS That's where the cave is.
The river winds o.s.
between the sheer sandstone Cliffs rising from either bank.
CORNELIUS And beyond that?
CORNELIUS Don't know.
CORNELIUS At high tide you can't ride along the shore, and we had no boats on the last expedition.
TAYLOR You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
CORNELIUS No one really knows.
CORNELIUS It's an ancient taboo.
CORNELIUS Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls.
CORNELIUS The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
LUCIUS Shouldn't we be moving on?
TAYLOR I'm for that.
TAYLOR They start toward the horses and wagon.
Zira is looking curiously at Nova, who stands in the shade leaning against the wagon as the males enter the scene.
Nova's nausea has passed, and she comes smiling to Taylor.
TAYLOR What's the diagnosis, doctor?
TAYLOR A touch of the sun?
ZIRA She's not sick at all.
ZIRA She's pregnant.
Consternation slowly gives way to wonder.
He grins.
TAYLOR So I'm not an altogether different breed, you see?
To reach the camp site -- a beach at the base of the gorge -- the party must lead the horses along a narrow trail that zigzags down the face of the sandstone cliffs.
They have abandoned the wagon.
Sand bars and two narrow beaches are in evidence here.
The camp itself consists of several lean-tos against the cliff wall.
Above the camp, reached by ladders connected to scaffolding, is the mouth of a cave.
Zira is cleaning up the breakfast things; Zaius and Lucius are sorting out equipment.
A small bowl of water rests on the ground in front of Taylor He has nearly finished shaving himself with a sharp hunting knife.
Nova watches, a look of fascinated approval on her face.
Taylor rinses off his knife, starts to dry it.
Nova reaches out, gently strokes his smooth -- if nicked -- chin.
TAYLOR You like it?
TAYLOR Lucius and Cornelius come up, Zira with them.
LUCIUS Why did you do that?
LUCIUS Scrape off your hair?
TAYLOR In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
CORNELIUS It makes you look somehow ...
CORNELIUS less intelligent.
CORNELIUS Taylor grins wryly at Cornelius, picks up his rifle.
TAYLOR When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
CORNELIUS Right now, if you like.
CORNELIUS They cross the beach to the ladders, when suddenly they hear the sound of horses.
CORNELIUS They look o.s.
Dr. Zaius and five armed and mounted apes have come around the corner of the beach and ride toward them through the rocks.
Taylor scrambles up onto the lower scaffold.
Lucius runs to a lean-to, scoops up his rifle.
CORNELIUS Lucius -- don't fire at them.
CORNELIUS The party rides up.
ZAIUS You're all under arrest!
ZAIUS You seditious scoundrel.
ZAIUS Drop that rifle.
348
He wavers, lowering his piece.
Zaius' gorillas ride forward a few paces, but halt again as Taylor shouts:
TAYLOR Stop right there.
ZAIUS Don't be a fool.
ZAIUS You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Taylor aims at Zaius and calls out:
TAYLOR If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die.
TAYLOR Depend on it.
CORNELIUS Taylor, you're not in command here.
CORNELIUS Put down that gun.
TAYLOR Shut up.
TAYLOR Silence.
TAYLOR Zaius knows Taylor isn't bluffing.
ZAIUS Very well.
ZAIUS Lower your weapons.
They obey.
Taylor calls again:
TAYLOR Tell them to move around the point.
TAYLOR Out of range.
TAYLOR Zaius turns and whispers to his apes.
TAYLOR They rein about and ride away through the rocks.
TAYLOR Zaius dismounts and approaches the fugitives alone.
TAYLOR He is unarmed.
As Zaius draws nearer) Lucius lowers his rifle.
But Taylor keeps his at the ready.
CORNELIUS How did you know we'd come here?
ZAIUS It wasn't difficult.
ZAIUS Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.
ZAIUS I see you brought along the female of your species.
ZAIUS I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
TAYLOR On this planet -- it's easy.
TAYLOR Zaius laughs derisively, then turns to the apes.
ZAIUS I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken.
ZAIUS If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years.
ZAIUS But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
CORNELIUS We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.
CORNELIUS But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
ZAIUS I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts.
ZAIUS They're worthless.
TAYLOR And that's your Minister of Science.
TAYLOR Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
ZIRA Taylor, please --
TAYLOR Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
ZAIUS There is no contradiction between faith and science.
ZAIUS True science.
TAYLOR All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
CORNELIUS Taylor, I'd rather you -
TAYLOR No.
TAYLOR You saved me from this fanatic.
TAYLOR Maybe I can pay you back.
ZAIUS What is your proposal?
TAYLOR When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
ZAIUS Twelve hundred years ago.
TAYLOR Very well.
TAYLOR If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
ZAIUS Of course.
TAYLOR Okay.Up to the cave.
TAYLOR He gestures toward the path leading to it.
TAYLOR Zaius, Zira, and Cornelius start upward.
TAYLOR Lucius starts to follow them.
TAYLOR Sorry, Lucius.
TAYLOR You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
LUCIUS Always giving orders.
LUCIUS Just like every other adult.
TAYLOR Relax.
TAYLOR You'll see it all later.
TAYLOR He pats the barrel of Lucius' gun, in the manner of a stern but benevolent non-com, then starts up the trail with Nova at his heels.
TAYLOR Lucius, unused to taking commands from an animal, scowls after him, then shrugs, adjusting to the Idea.
AFTERNOON The sun hovers over the lofty rim of the lake like a great red balloon.
AFTERNOON The wall of the gorge, in shadow, is a darker hue.
The crenelated east wall, looking like a red cathedral, is aglow with sunlight.
So is the mouth of the cave as the three apes, Taylor and Nova pass through it and o.s.
Nature has formed a vaulted room here.
It need not be enormous, but should be as weird and fantastic as production capabilities permit.
There is an ape-made excavation in the floor of the cave, some ten feet square and eight feet deep.
Some small objects lie on the rim of the excavation.
Zaius, Cornelius, Zira, Taylor and Nova enter from the outside.
(AUTHOR'S NOTE: The effect should be an eyeful.
I wish to create an illusion of sunlight penetrating this cave, flooding it with direct, refracted illumination, transforming it into a kaleidoscopic cavern.)
ZAIUS Present your evidence, Cornelius.
ZAIUS Cornelius clambers down into the pit, followed by Zira.
ZAIUS Taylor bends down, examines some of the artifacts lined along the edge of the excavation.
ZAIUS Nova sits beside him.
CORNELIUS It was at this level I discovered traces of an early ape creature -- stage of primitive barbarism, really -- dating back roughly thirteen hundred years.
CORNELIUS It was here I found cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz and the fossilized bones of carnivorous gorillas.
CAMERA (ON BOOM) MOVES IN SLOWLY as Cornelius continues:
CORNELIUS But the artifacts lying at your feet were found here, at this level.
CORNELIUS And that's the paradox.
CORNELIUS The more ancient culture is the more advanced.
CORNELIUS Admittedly, many of these objects are unidentified, but clearly they were fashioned by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.
CORNELIUS CAMERA KEEPS MOVING IN on the group in and around the excavation as
Cornelius continues:
CORNELIUS Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own.
CORNELIUS Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
ZAIUS Don't speak to me in absolutes.
ZAIUS The evidence is contestable.
CORNELIUS I apologize.
ZAIUS To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least.
ZAIUS There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
TAYLOR Perhaps that's why they're on your staff.
TAYLOR Zaius flicks a hostile glance at Taylor, then looks down at the artifacts.
TAYLOR He nudges them with his foot.
ZAIUS Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
ZIRA But there's the doll, sir.
ZAIUS What?
CORNELIUS Right there.
CORNELIUS The human doll.
CORNELIUS Zaius deigns to stoop and pick it up.
It is only a porcelain fragment, but the head is intact, and it is unmistakably the form of a human child.
ZAIUS What does this prove?
ZAIUS My grand- daughter plays with human dolls.
Exasperated, Zira turns to the man for confirmation.
ZIRA Taylor!
ZIRA Tell him.
TAYLOR He has a point.
TAYLOR On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
TAYLOR Zaius idly tosses the doll to the ground near Nova.
TAYLOR She picks it up, studies it.
Cornelius tries again.
CORNELIUS A doll alone proves nothing.
CORNELIUS True.
CORNELIUS But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
ZAIUS Your conclusion is premature.
ZAIUS Have you forgotten your Scripture?
ZAIUS The Thirteenth Scroll?
ZAIUS 'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
CORNELIUS No sir, I haven't forgotten.
ZAIUS Well?
ZAIUS For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.
ZAIUS Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed.
ZAIUS Keep digging Cornelius.
ZAIUS You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
As Zira again appeals to the man.
ZIRA Are you going to let that pass without an answer?
ZIRA Taylor, who has been toying with objects in the dirt, looks up.
TAYLOR Yes.
TAYLOR I have to agree.
TAYLOR From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
CORNELIUS What are you doing there?
TAYLOR Reconstructing a life.
TAYLOR Care to have a look?
TAYLOR Cornelius and Zira cross the pit and Zaius walks around the rim of the excavation.
As the apes come close.
A number of artifacts have been arranged in front of Taylor.
TAYLOR These were found near the human doll, right?
TAYLOR Well, whoever owned them was in pretty bad shape.
TAYLOR He picks up the twisted fragment of a pair of spectacles.
TAYLOR Defective eyesight..
TAYLOR As Taylor continues his monologue, he picks up the other objects one by one.
TAYLOR He wore false teeth.
TAYLOR He suffered from a hernia and used this truss to hold up his insides ...
TAYLOR And toward the end, these little rings of stainless steel enclosed a prefab- ricated valve in his failing heart.
TAYLOR Taylor pauses.
TAYLOR Zaius picks up two of the steel rings, studies them.
TAYLOR I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.
TAYLOR Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
ZAIUS That's lunacy.
ZAIUS I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours.
ZAIUS But it would be conjecture, not proof.
She is poking her finger inside the decapitated head of the doll.
From it comes a distorted SOUND.
DOLL'S HEAD Mamma!
DOLL'S HEAD Mamma!
DOLL'S HEAD Mamma!.
DOLL'S HEAD The apes stare at the doll in astonishment.
DOLL'S HEAD Taylor snatches the doll from Nova, brandishes it at the astonished Zaius.
TAYLOR Dr. Zaius!
TAYLOR Would an ape make a human doll that talks?
TAYLOR Zaius looks at him, speechless.
TAYLOR At that moment the CRACK of a distant rifle shot reverberates through the cavern.
TAYLOR All present freeze, listening.
ZIRA Lucius....
Taylor alone is armed.
Raising his rifle, he glowers at Zaius.
TAYLOR You louse!
TAYLOR Cornelius is already crossing the pit.
TAYLOR He climbs out arid races toward the mouth of the cave.
TAYLOR Taylor runs after him.
TAYLOR Zira and Nova hurry after Taylor.
Expressionless, he looks down at the doll, then moves toward the mouth of the cave.
Cornelius emerges from mouth of the cave and runs down the trail toward CAMERA.
He halts in f.g., looking down at:
Two of Zaius' gorillas have disarmed Lucius and are clubbing him with their rifle butts.
Two other mounted apes are driving the scientists' horses back beyond the trees.
Cornelius, Taylor, Nova and Zira (in that order) can be seen high above, descending the trail.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO DISCLOSE A GORILLA SNIPER in immediate f.g., crouching behind a boulder near the water.
He sights his rifle at the man on the trail.
Taylor is still too distant to make a sure target, and so the sniper waits.
This portion of the trail has no cover or concealment.
Unaware of the sniper, Taylor looks down at the camp as he makes his descent.
The gorilla fires.
The bullet ricochets off the rock wall a foot above his head.
Taylor scans the terrain bewlow, looking for the sniper.
Nova comes to his side, pointing at:
His head is visible behind the boulder as he reloads his piece .
He aims and fires.
Taylor has missed him, but the sniper ducks behind the boulder.
Taylor takes her hand and they race back up the trail to where Zira is standing.
Outcroppings of rock offer some cover here.
Taylor pushes Nova down behind a rock and signals for Zira to follow suit.
The sniper's SECOND SHOT rings out.
Instead of returning the fire, Taylor looks up the rail at:
He is standing impassively on the trail a short distance below the mouth of the cave.
Bent low, he comes charging up the trail toward Zaius.
The sniper's THIRD SHOT splatters rock fragments around him.
Zaius starts to retreat to the cave, but stumbles and falls on some loose shale.
No sooner has Zaius regained his feet than Taylor overtakes him.
Seizing the ape around the neck with his left arm.
Taylor drives the muzzle of his pistol into Zaius' kidney.
He spins Zaius around, using him as a shield.
Taylor releases the pressure on Zaius' throat but keeps the gun pointed at his back.
TAYLOR Tell him to pull back!
ZAIUS Cease fire!
ZAIUS Withdraw!
ZAIUS His command echoes from the west wall of the canyon.
The sniper emerges from behind a boulder near the shore, and walks off along the beach.
Taylor lift's the muzzle of his rifle and presses it against the back of Zaius' head.
TAYLOR I ought to kill you right now.
TAYLOR Let's go.
TAYLOR They move off down the trail.
Zira rushes down the trail to Lucius, who is sprawled on the ground.
He has a bloody nose and a lump on his forehead.
Nova and Cornelius come next, then Taylor, prodding Zaius ahead of him at gun point.
Lucius appears to be more humiliated than hurt.
LUCIUS They took me by surprise.
LUCIUS Sneaked up on me while I was watering the horses.
LUCIUS What's happened to honor?
LUCIUS I got off one round to warn you.
CORNELIUS They've taken everything.
TAYLOR Not everything.
TAYLOR They left a hostage.
TAYLOR How do you feel, Lucius?
LUCIUS Disillusioned...
LUCIUS But vindicated!
LUCIUS I've been right all along.
LUCIUS You can't trust the older generation.
LUCIUS It's a matter of values --
TAYLOR All right, all right.
TAYLOR Will You do me a favor?
TAYLOR No orders.
LUCIUS What is it?
TAYLOR I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
LUCIUS Yes, I can do that.
TAYL0R Good.
TAYL0R Say I want a week's supply of food for the woman and myself.
TAYL0R A horse.
TAYL0R A spade.
TAYL0R And fifty rounds of ammunition.
LUCIUS What if they won't agree to your terms?
TAYLOR Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
ZIRA Taylor, you can't.
ZAIUS Oh yes he can.
ZAIUS He's a born killer.
ZAIUS Deliver the message.
ZAIUS Lucius looks to Taylor for confirmation.
ZAIUS Taylor nods.
ZAIUS The young ape hurries away through the rocks.
ZAIUS Taylor crosses to a useless saddle, picks up a coil of rope, gestures at Zaius, indicating a nearby tree.
TAYLOR Sit down.
TAYLOR Over there.
TAYLOR Zaius squats on the ground beside the tree.
TAYLOR Taylor sets his rifle against the trunk, fashions a noose and places it around Zaius' neck.
TAYLOR Then, using an ingenious combination of knots, he ties Zaius' hands behind his back, and finally fastens the rope around the base of the tree.
TAYLOR Now, Minister of Science - let me explain certain principle stress and strain.
TAYLOR If you exert pressure to remove these bonds, you'll choke yourself to death.
TAYLOR It'll be suicide, you see?
TAYLOR Zira and Cornelius look down at the captive mandarin.
TAYLOR Their rebellious spirit has evaporated, and they are clearly afraid.
ZIRA Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
TAYLOR Why not?
ZIRA It's humiliating.
TAYLOR Wasn't I humiliated?
TAYLOR By all of you?
TAYLOR Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
CORNELIUS That was different.
CORNELIUS We thought you were ....
CORNELIUS inferior.
TAYLOR And now you know the truth.
TAYLOR Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor.
TAYLOR He proved it.
TAYLOR Man preceded you here.
TAYLOR You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
ZAIUS Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
TAYLOR He might have been wiped out by a plague.
TAYLOR Natural catastrophe.
TAYLOR Like a fiery storm of meteors.
TAYLOR From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
ZIRA, But we can't be sure.
TAYLOR He is.
TAYLOR He knew all the time.
TAYLOR Long before your discovery, he knew.
TAYLOR Defender of the Faith.
TAYLOR Guardian of the terrible secret.
TAYLOR Isn't that right, doctor?
As Zira and Cornelius look at him expectantly.
ZAIUS What I know of man was written long ago -- set down by the wisest ape of all -- our Lawgiver.
ZAIUS Open my breast pocket.
ZAIUS Cornelius crosses to Zaius, and takes a small book bound in black leather from the breast pocket of his tunic.
ZAIUS Read it to him: the twentythird Scroll, ninth Verse.
Cornelius thumbs through the book, finds the citation and reads aloud:
CORNELIUS 'Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn.
CORNELIUS Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport, or lust or greed.
CORNELIUS Yes, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land.
CORNELIUS Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours.
CORNELIUS Shun him.
CORNELIUS Drive him back into his jungle lair: For he is the harbinger of death'.
CORNELIUS Cornelius falls silent and looks down at Zaius.
ZAIUS I found nothing in the cave to alter that conception of man.
ZAIUS And I still live by its injunction.
Lucius hurries out of the rocks leading a saddled horse.
Zaius' five mounted gorillas appear behind him.
Taylor calls out to them:
TAYLOR Stay where you are!
TAYLOR Lucius comes up with the horse.
TAYLOR Taylor checks the provisions in the saddlebags.
TAYLOR Lucius is frowning.
LUCIUS They think you're behaving foolishly.
LUCIUS I must say I agree.
LUCIUS Where will you go?
TAYLOR I'll start by following the shoreline.
TAYLOR And my nose.
ZIRA But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland.
ZIRA How will you survive?
ZAIUS He won't survive.
ZAIUS Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor?
ZAIUS That of an animal.
ZAIUS If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
TAYLOR Then there is another jungle?
ZAIUS Of course, you could return with us.
ZAIUS Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
TAYLOR Sure.
TAYLOR In a cage.
ZAIUS Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
TAYLOR No, thanks.
TAYLOR I'll take freedom.
TAYLOR Taylor mounts the horse, extends a helping hand to Nova, who vault's nimbly onto the horse's rump.
TAYLOR Taylor looks at Zira and Cornelius.
TAYLOR Would you like to come along?
ZIRA We can't.
TAYLOR It's better than going to prison for heresy.
CORNELIUS They can't convict us of that.
CORNELIUS You proved our innocence.
CORNELIUS Besides...
CORNELIUS ...
CORNELIUS his culture is our culture.
TAYLOR Good luck then.
TAYLOR He reaches down, grasps Cornelius' hand, then grins crookedly.
TAYLOR Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
ZIRA All right, but....
ZIRA ...you're so damned ugly!
ZIRA Taylor smiles, leans down, kisses her.
ZIRA Go with God, Taylor.
ZIRA That's an old expression.
ZIRA it comes from both ape and man.
TAYLOR God bless you.
TAYLOR He extends his hand to Lucius, who takes it.
TAYLOR Lucius.
LUCIUS I think you're making a mistake.
TAYLOR That's the boy.
TAYLOR Keep 'em flying.
LUCIUS What?
TAYLOR The flags of discontent.
TAYLOR It's the only way anything ever gets changed.
TAYLOR Don't try to follow us.
TAYLOR I'm pretty handy with things like this.
ZAIUS Of that I'm sure.
ZAIUS All my life I've awaited your coming and dreaded it.
ZAIUS Like death itself.
ZAIUS Taylor looks piercingly at Zaius, more troubled than offended.
TAYLOR Why?
TAYLOR From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor.
TAYLOR And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me.
TAYLOR Why?
ZAIUS Because you are a man.
ZAIUS And you were right -- I have always known about man.
ZAIUS From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy.
ZAIUS His emotions must rule his brain.
ZAIUS He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
TAYLOR What evidence?
TAYLOR No weapons were found in the cave.
ZAIUS The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise.
ZAIUS Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
TAYLOR We're back at the beginning.
TAYLOR I still don't know the why.
TAYLOR A planet where apes evolved from men.
TAYLOR A world turned wrong side up.
TAYLOR A puzzle with one piece missing.
ZAIUS Don't look for it, Taylor.
ZAIUS You may not like what you find.
Taylor shakes his head, still baffled, digs his heels into the horse's flank.
It canters off along the sandy shore.
Zira, Cornelius and Lucius sadly watch the departure.
ZAIUS Untie me!
ZAIUS Cornelius moves quickly to remove the rope from Zaius' neck.
ZAIUS Behind them, the five mounted gorillas gallop forward.
ZAIUS Zaius gets up, waves them to a halt.
ZAIUS No, no!
ZAIUS Let him go!
Taylor looks back, sees that Zaius has stopped the mounted apes, slows his horse to a trot, smiles at Nova.
405
Zaius watches as Taylor's horse moves farther away along the beach.
Then he turns to an ape called MARCUS.
ZAIUS Fetch your explosives.
ZAIUS We're going to seal the cave.
MARCUS Yes, sir.
MARCUS He remounts his horse and rides o.s.
CORNELIUS Seal the cave?
ZAIUS That's correct.
ZAIUS And you will both stand trial for heresy.
ZIRA But the proof?
ZIRA The doll?
ZAIUS In a few minutes there will be no doll.
ZAIUS There can't be.
ZAIUS I'm sorry.
ZAIUS Cornelius throws himself at Zaius.
CORNELIUS You mustn't!
CORNELIUS You gave your 'word!
CORNELIUS Zaius looks emptily at one of his apes.
ZAIUS What I do, I do with no pleasure.
ZAIUS Silence him.
ZAIUS A hairy hand is clapped over Cornelius' mouth.
ZAIUS He is dragged off, struggling, kicking.
ZAIUS Julius, unafraid, glares at Zaius.
LUCIUS Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable!
LUCIUS Why must knowledge stand still?
LUCIUS What about the future?
LUCIUS Zaius looks benevolently at Julius.
ZAIUS I may just have saved it for you.
ZAIUS Julius and Zira look at each other, befuddled.
ZAIUS Once more their eyes follow the retreating figures of Taylor and Nova.
ZAIUS The beach separating the water from the canyon becomes narrower as they move downstream.
LUCIUS What will he find out there, doctor?
His face is A mask, his tone enigmatic.
ZAIUS His destiny.
A moment later, as they watch, Taylor and Nova vanish around the bend.
408
Taylor and Nova are already far downstream.
There is a striking change in the terrain.
The area is still desolate,but some vegetation can be seen on the palisade above the narrow beach, and the river has widened to form a vast tidal basin where it meets the sea.
A NOTE ON PRODUCTION: If feasible at new location site, this scene should be shot at high tide, so that the water laps at the base of the cliffs, making a passage difficult and risky.
He is alert, sniffing the salt air, sizing up the situation.
Hearing the CRIES of birds, he reins in and looks' up.
Sea gulls are soaring overhead.
His expression is expectant, searching.
Nova emits a whimper of anticipation, pointing off.
A verdant forest atop a distant palisade.
Their view of the beach below the forest, is cut off by a rocky promontory in the middle distance.
He smiles at her hopefully.
TAYLOR Yes, Nova -- I see it.
TAYLOR In my old profession green meant safe.
TAYLOR Green meant go.
TAYLOR The horse moves off at a trot, CAMERA PANNING.
TAYLOR But they have gone only a short distance when they hear the distant THUNDER of an EXPLOSION.
TAYLOR Taylor reins in and looks back.
A column of smoke and dust rises from the exploded cave far upstream.
Frowning with concern, Taylor gazes for a moment at the smoke, then decides this is no time to linger.
He digs his heels into the horse's flanks and they move off at a canter, riding toward the promontory that splits the beach.
They are nearing the promontory that blocks their view of the beach beyond.
418
As they round the promontory, the tip of a strange rock formation comes into view.
it appears to be jutting from the sea.
He reins in momentarily, baffled by what he sees.
Then he rides on.
An immense column juts from the beach at a thirty-degree angle.
We can now see that it is not rock, but metal.
Green metallic tints show through its gray salt-stained surface.
As we draw closer, the object takes on the appearance of a massive arm, its top shaped like a hand holding a torch.
Frowning with consternation.
His horse proceeds at a slow walk.
Near the base of the column, where the shore and water meet, are a row of metal spikes.
From this angle they look like tank traps.
Dumbfounded, he slides from his saddle, approaches the spikes.
Nova dismounts and follows him.
TAYLOR My God!
TAYLOR He falls to his knees, buries his head in his hands.
TAYLOR CAMERA SLOWLY DRAWS BACK AND UP to a HIGH ANGLE SHOT disclosing what Taylor has found.
TAYLOR Half-buried in the sand and washed by the waves is the Statue of Liberty.
