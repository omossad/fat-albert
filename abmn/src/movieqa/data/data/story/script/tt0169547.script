On VIDEO: JANE BURNHAM lays in bed, wearing a tank top.
She's sixteen, with dark, intense eyes.
JANE I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school.
JANE What a lame-o.
JANE Somebody really should put him out of his misery.
Her mind wanders for a beat.
RICKY (O.C.) Want me to kill him for you?
Jane looks at us and sits up.
JANE Yeah, would you?
We're FLYING above suburban America, DESCENDING SLOWLY toward a tree-lined street.
LESTER (V.O.) My name is Lester Burnham.
LESTER (V.O.) This is my neighborhood.
LESTER (V.O.) This is my street.
LESTER (V.O.) This...
LESTER (V.O.) is my life.
LESTER (V.O.) I'm forty-two years old.
LESTER (V.O.) In less than a year, I'll be dead.
We're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD:
LESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens, face down, wearing PAJAMAS.
An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS.
Lester gropes blindly to shut it off.
LESTER (V.O.) Of course, I don't know that yet.
LESTER (V.O.) He rolls over, looks up at us and sighs.
LESTER (V.O.) He doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect of a new day.
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) And in a way, I'm dead already.
He sits up and puts on his slippers.
Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower.
ANGLE from outside the shower: Lester's naked body is silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door.
It becomes apparent he is masturbating.
LESTER (V.O.) Look at me, jerking off in the shower.
LESTER (V.O.) This will be the high point of my day.
LESTER (V.O.) It's all downhill from here.
CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE.
A gloved hand with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.
CAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham house.
A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools.
Lester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor, peeping out through the drapes.
LESTER (V.O.) That's my wife Carolyn.
LESTER (V.O.) See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs?
LESTER (V.O.) That's not an accident.
In the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS repeatedly.
A MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #1) chastises the barking dog.
JIM #1 Hush, Bitsy.
JIM #1 You hush.
JIM #1 What is wrong?
LESTER (V.O.) That's our next-door neighbor Jim.
A second MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #2) comes out of the house.
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) And that's his lover, Jim.
JIM #2 What in the world is wrong with her?
JIM #2 She had a walk this morning.
JIM #1 And a jerky treat.
JIM #2 You spoil her.
JIM #2 Bitsy.
JIM #2 No bark.
JIM #2 Come inside.
JIM #2 Now.
Lester watches all this from the window.
CAROLYN Good morning, Jim!
Jim #1 walks toward the fence to greet Carolyn.
JIM #1 Morning, Carolyn.
CAROLYN I just love your tie!
CAROLYN That color!
JIM #1 I just love your roses.
JIM #1 How do you get them to flourish like this?
CAROLYN Well, I'll tell you.
CAROLYN Egg shells and Miracle Grow.
Jim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is watching them.
LESTER (V.O.) Man.
LESTER (V.O.) I get exhausted just watching her.
Lester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying, but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host.
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) She wasn't always like this.
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) She used to be happy.
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) We used to be happy.
JANE is seated at her desk, working at her computer.
LESTER (V.O.) My daughter Jane.
LESTER (V.O.) Only child.
CLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR: A PERSONAL BANKING SOFTWARE window suddenly disappears to reveal another window: a PLASTIC SURGERY WEBSITE, featuring clinical "before" and "after" photos of surgically augmented breasts.
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Janie's a pretty typical teenager.
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Angry, insecure, confused.
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass...
Outside, a CAR HORN BLARES.
Jane stuffs items into her
(CONT'D) But I don't want to lie to her.
We HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside.
Jane studies herself in a mirror, then shifts to get a good profile of her breasts.
Carolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ ML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the HORN again.
Jane shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her shoulder.
CAROLYN Jane.
CAROLYN Honey.
CAROLYN Are you trying to look unattractive?
JANE Yes.
CAROLYN Well, congratulations.
CAROLYN You've succeeded admirably.
Jane gets in the car.
Lester hurries out the front door, carrying a BRIEFCASE.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Lester, could you make me a little later, please?
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Because I'm not quite late enough.
Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill all over the driveway.
He drops to his knees to gather everything.
JANE Nice going, Dad.
Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.
His POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.
LESTER (V.O.) Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and...
LESTER (V.O.) they're right.
Carolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window.
Lester is asleep in the back seat.
LESTER (V.O.) I have lost something.
LESTER (V.O.) I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this...
LESTER (V.O.) sedated.
LESTER (V.O.) But you know what?
LESTER (V.O.) It's never too late to get it back.
Lester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES.
He's staring at a computer monitor and talking on a HEADSET PHONE.
The beleaguered expression on his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his voice.
LESTER Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr.
LESTER Tamblin, please?...
LESTER Well, we're all under a deadline here, uh, but you see, there is some basic information about the product launch that isn't even covered in your press release and I...
LESTER Yeah.
LESTER Can I ask you a question?
LESTER Who is Tamblin?
LESTER Does he exist?
LESTER 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in...
LESTER Yeah, okay, I'll leave my number...
BRAD, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes Lester, who is unaware of his presence.
LESTER (CONT'D) It's 555 0199.
LESTER (CONT'D) Lester Burnham.
LESTER (CONT'D) Thank you!
Lester disconnects the call, obviously irritated.
BRAD Hey Les.
BRAD You got a minute?
Lester turns around, smiling perfunctorily
LESTER For you, Brad?
LESTER I've got five.
Brad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office.
BRAD I'm sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here.
Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated.
LESTER Oh, sure.
LESTER Times are tight, and you gotta free up cash.
LESTER Gotta spend money to make money.
LESTER Right?
BRAD Exactly.
BRAD So...
Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out.
LESTER Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St.
LESTER Regis for, what was it, like, three months?
BRAD That's unsubstantiated gossip.
LESTER That's fifty thousand dollars.
LESTER That's somebody's salary.
LESTER That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!
BRAD Jesus.
BRAD Calm down.
BRAD Nobody's getting fired yet.
BRAD That's why we're having everyone write out a job description, mapping out in detail how they contribute.
BRAD That way, management can assess who's valuable and--
LESTER Who's expendable.
BRAD It's just business.
LESTER I've been writing for this magazine for fourteen years, Brad.
LESTER You've been here how long, a whole month?
BRAD I'm one of the good guys, Les.
BRAD I'm trying to level with you.
BRAD This is your one chance to save your job.
Lester stares at him, powerless.
A MOVING VAN is parked in front of the COLONIAL HOUSE next door to the Burnhams'.
Movers carry furniture toward the house.
The Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway.
Carolyn drives, Lester is in the passenger seat.
CAROLYN --there is no decision, you just write the damn thing!
LESTER You don't think it's weird and kinda fascist?
CAROLYN Possibly.
CAROLYN But you don't want to be unemployed.
LESTER Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan, because it's more convenient that way.
CAROLYN Could you be just a little bit more dramatic, please, huh?
As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS next door.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) So we've finally got new neighbors.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) You know, if the Lomans had let me represent them, instead of--
CAROLYN (CONT'D) --"The Real Estate King," that house would never have sat on the market for six months.
She heads into the house, followed by Lester.
LESTER Well, they were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore.
CAROLYN Their sycamore?
CAROLYN C'mon!
CAROLYN A substantial portion of the root structure was on our property.
CAROLYN You know that.
CAROLYN How can you call it their sycamore?
CAROLYN I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something if it wasn't partially mine, which of course it was.
We HEAR EASY-LISTENING MUSIC.
Lester, Carolyn and Jane are eating dinner by CANDLELIGHT.
RED ROSES are bunched in a vase at the center of the table.
Nobody makes eye contact, or even seems aware of anybody else's presence, until...
JANE Mom, do we always have to listen to this elevator music?
CAROLYN No.
CAROLYN No, we don't.
CAROLYN As soon as you've prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that I'm about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like.
A long beat.
Lester suddenly turns to Jane.
LESTER So Janie, how was school?
JANE It was okay.
LESTER Just okay?
JANE No, Dad.
JANE It was spec-tac-ular.
A beat.
LESTER Well, you want to know how things went at my job today?
Now she looks at him as if he's lost his mind.
LESTER (CONT'D) They've hired this efficiency expert, this really friendly guy named Brad, how perfect is that?
LESTER (CONT'D) And he's basically there to make it seem like they're justified in firing somebody, because they couldn't just come right out and say that, could they?
LESTER (CONT'D) No, no, that would be too...
LESTER (CONT'D) honest.
LESTER (CONT'D) And so they've asked us--
LESTER (CONT'D) --you couldn't possibly care any less, could you?
Carolyn is watching this closely.
JANE Well, what do you expect?
JANE You can't all of a sudden be my best friend, just because you had a bad day.
She gets up and heads toward the kitchen.
JANE (CONT'D) I mean, hello.
JANE (CONT'D) You've barely even spoken to me for months.
She's gone.
Lester notices Carolyn looking at him critically.
LESTER Oh, what, you're mother-of-the-year?
LESTER You treat her like an employee.
CAROLYN What?!
Lester is quiet, staring at his plate.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) What?
Lester gets up and starts after Jane, taking his plate with him.
LESTER I'm going to get some ice cream.
Carolyn watches him go, irritated.
Jane stands at the sink, rinsing off her plate.
Lester enters.
LESTER Honey, I'm sorry.
LESTER I...
Jane turns and stares at him, waiting for him to finish.
LESTER (CONT'D) I'm sorry I haven't been more available, I just...
LESTER (CONT'D) I'm...
He's looking to her for a little help here, but she's too uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any.
LESTER (CONT'D) You know, you don't always have to wait for me to come to you...
JANE Oh, great.
JANE So now it's my fault?
LESTER I didn't say that.
LESTER It's nobody's fault.
LESTER Janie, what happened?
LESTER You and I used to be pals.
On VIDEO: We're looking through GREENHOUSE WINDOWS at Lester and Jane in the kitchen We can't hear what they're saying, but it's obvious it's not going well.
Jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves.
We FOLLOW HER out the door, then the camera JERKS back to Lester calling after her.
CLOSE on the face of RICKY FITTS, illuminated by the screen of his DIGICAM as he videotapes.
Ricky is eighteen, but his eyes are much older.
Beneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks something wounded...
and dangerous.
His POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester at the sink, rinsing off his plate, muttering to himself.
His head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes he's being watched.
Lester's POV: We're looking out through the kitchen window at the point where Ricky was just standing, but he's no longer there.
Lester turns off the faucet, dries his hands, then tosses the towel on the counter on his way out, where it lands next to a framed PHOTOGRAPH of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger Jane, taken several years earlier at an amusement park.
It's startling how happy they look.
CLOSE on a wooden SIGN that reads:
555-0195 Carolyn Burnham
The sign is planted in front of a RUN-DOWN HOME in a run-down neighborhood.
The Mercedes is parked in front of the house.
Carolyn, wearing a smart business suit, is unloading a box of cleaning supplies and a BOOMBOX from the back of the Mercedes when something across the street catches her eye.
Her POV: In front of a different house with much more curb appeal is another SIGN, featuring a picture of a handsome silver-haired MAN.
It reads:
Another One SOLD By Buddy Kane
The Real Estate King 555-0100
Carolyn frowns and slams the back of the Mercedes shut.
The interior of this house is ugly, oppressive and tasteless.
Carolyn opens the front door, breathes deeply and solemnly announces:
CAROLYN I will sell this house today.
She neatly arranges her sales materials on a desk, then strips down to her undergarments.
We see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she:
Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool;
Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen;
Perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom;
And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.
Throughout all this, she keeps repeating to herself:
CAROLYN (CONT'D) I will sell this house today.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) I will sell this house today.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) I will sell this house today.
Carolyn stands in front of the mirror, wearing her suit once more, applying lipstick.
She stares at her reflection critically.
CAROLYN I will sell this house today.
She says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge on the mirror and wipes it off.
The front door opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting us with the smile she thinks could sell ice to an Eskimo.
CAROLYN Welcome.
CAROLYN I'm Carolyn Burnham!
Smiling, Carolyn leads a man and woman into the living room.
They're thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today.
CAROLYN This living room is very dramatic.
CAROLYN Wait 'til you see the native stone fireplace!
The man and woman glance around the dark room, unimpressed.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) A simple cream would really lighten things up.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) You could even put in a skylight.
The woman wrinkles her face, skeptical.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Well, why don't we go into the kitchen?
Carolyn enters, followed by a different couple in their fifties.
CAROLYN It's a dream come true for any cook.
CAROLYN Just filled with positive energy.
CAROLYN Huh?
Carolyn stands with a different couple: African American, late twenties.
The woman is pregnant.
CAROLYN ...and you'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan can cut down on your energy costs.
Carolyn stands by the pool next to two fortyish WOMEN.
CAROLYN You know, you could have some really fun backyard get-togethers out here.
WOMAN #1 The ad said this pool was "lagoon-like."
WOMAN #1 There's nothing "lagoon-like" about it.
WOMAN #1 Except for maybe the bugs.
WOMAN #2 There's not even any plants out here.
CAROLYN What do you call this?
CAROLYN Is this not a plant?
CAROLYN If you have a problem with the plants, I can always call my landscape architect.
CAROLYN Solved.
WOMAN #2 I mean, I think "lagoon," I think waterfall, I think tropical.
WOMAN #2 This is a cement hole.
A beat.
CAROLYN I have some tiki torches in the garage.
Carolyn enters, alone.
She's furious.
She locks the sliding glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut, then stops.
Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that seemingly escape against her will.
Suddenly she SLAPS herself, hard.
CAROLYN Shut up.
CAROLYN Stop it.
CAROLYN You...
CAROLYN Weak!
But the tears continue.
She SLAPS herself again.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Weak.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Baby.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Shut up.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Shut up!
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Shut up!
She SLAPS herself repeatedly until she stops crying.
She stands there, taking deep breaths until she has everything under control, then pulls the blinds shut, once again all business.
She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark, empty room.
We HEAR CHEERING and APPLAUSE.
We're at a high-school BASKETBALL GAME.
Teenage boys play a fast and furious game.
One team wearing pale blue and white uniforms scores a basket.
Perky cheerleaders jump up and down as the CROWD goes wild.
Seated in the bleachers, next to the high school BAND, is a group of about twenty TEENAGE GIRLS, dressed in pale blue and white uniforms.
Among them, Jane sits next to ANGELA HAYES.
At sixteen, Angela is strikingly beautiful; with perfect even features, blonde hair and a nubile young body, she's the archetypal American dream girl.
Jane stands and scans the bleachers.
ANGELA Who are you looking for?
JANE My parents are coming tonight.
JANE They're trying to, you know, take an active interest in me.
ANGELA Gross.
ANGELA I hate it when my mom does that.
JANE They're such assholes.
JANE Why can't they just have their own lives?
Carolyn drives.
Lester is slumped in the passenger seat.
LESTER What makes you so sure she wants us to be there?
LESTER Did she ask us to come?
CAROLYN Of course not.
CAROLYN She doesn't want us to know how important this is to her.
CAROLYN But she's been practicing her steps for weeks.
LESTER Well, I bet money she's going to resent it.
LESTER And I'm missing the James Bond marathon on TNT.
CAROLYN Lester, this is important.
CAROLYN I'm sensing a real distance growing between you and Jane.
LESTER Growing?
LESTER She hates me.
CAROLYN She's just willful.
LESTER She hates you too.
Carolyn stares at him, unsure of how to respond.
The uniformed girls now stand in formation on the gym floor.
ANNOUNCER And now, for your half-time entertainment, Rockwell High's award- winning Dancing Spartanettes!
In the crowded stands, Lester and Carolyn find seats.
LESTER We can leave right after this, right?
The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays "ON BROADWAY."
On the gym floor, the girls perform.
They're well-rehearsed, but too young to carry off the ambitious Vegas routine they're attempting.
Lester, watching from the stands, picks out his daughter.
His POV: Jane performs well, concentrating.
Dancing awkwardly next to her is Angela.
Suddenly Angela looks right at us and smiles...
a lazy, insolent smile.
Lester leans forward in his seat.
His POV: We're focused on Angela now.
Everything starts to SLOW DOWN...
the MUSIC acquires an eerie ECHO...
We ZOOM slowly toward Lester as he watches, transfixed.
His POV: Angela's awkwardness gives way to a fluid grace, and "ON BROADWAY" FADES into dreamy, hypnotic MUSIC.
The light on Angela grows stronger, and the other girls DISAPPEAR entirely.
Lester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound.
His POV: Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for Lester.
Her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as she starts to unzip her uniform, teasing us with an expression that's both innocent and knowing, then...
she pulls her uniform OPEN and a profusion of RED ROSE PETALS spill forth...
and we SMASH CUT TO:
Angela, fully clothed, is once again surrounded by the other girls.
The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays its last note, the Dancing Spartanettes strike their final pose, and the audience
Carolyn claps along with the rest of the audience.
Lester just sits there, unable to take his eyes off Angela.
The game is long over.
Jane and Angela come out of the gym.
JANE Oh shit, they're still here.
Her POV: Lester and Carolyn stand at the edge of the parking lot.
LESTER Janie!
CAROLYN Hi!
CAROLYN I really enjoyed that!
She crosses reluctantly toward her parents, followed by Angela.
LESTER Congratulations, honey, you were great.
JANE I didn't win anything.
LESTER Hi, I'm Lester.
LESTER Janie's dad.
ANGELA Oh.
ANGELA Hi.
An awkward beat.
JANE This is my friend, Angela Hayes.
LESTER Okay, good to meet you.
LESTER You were also good tonight.
LESTER Very...
LESTER precise.
ANGELA Thanks.
CAROLYN Nice to meet you, Angela.
CAROLYN Honey, I'm so proud of you.
CAROLYN I watched you very closely, and you didn't screw up once.
CAROLYN Okay, we have to go.
She starts toward the parking lot.
Lester stays behind.
LESTER So, what are you girls doing now?
JANE Dad.
ANGELA We're going out for pizza.
LESTER Oh really, do you need a ride?
LESTER We can give you a ride.
LESTER I have a car.
LESTER You wanna come with us?
ANGELA Thanks...
ANGELA but I have a car.
LESTER Oh, you have a car.
LESTER Oh.
LESTER That's great!
LESTER That's great, because Janie's thinking about getting a car soon too, aren't you, honey?
JANE Dad.
JANE Mom's waiting for you.
LESTER Well, it was very nice meeting you, Angela.
LESTER Any, uh, friend of Janie's is a friend of mine.
Angela smiles, aware of the power she has over him.
He is mesmerized; grateful, even.
LESTER (CONT'D) Well...
LESTER (CONT'D) I'll be seeing you around then.
Lester waves awkwardly as he crosses off.
JANE Could he be any more pathetic?
ANGELA I think it's sweet.
ANGELA And I think he and your mother have not had sex in a long time.
CLOSE on a solitary red ROSE PETAL as it falls slowly through the air.
We're looking down on Lester and Carolyn in bed.
Even in sleep, Carolyn looks determined.
Lester is awake and stares up at us.
LESTER It's the weirdest thing.
The ROSE PETAL drifts into view, landing on his pillow.
LESTER (CONT'D) I feel like I've been in a coma for about twenty years, and I'm just now waking up.
More ROSE PETALS fall onto the bed, and he smiles up at...
His POV: Angela, naked, FLOATS above us as a deluge of ROSE PETALS falls around her.
Her hair fans out around her head and GLOWS with a subtle, burnished light.
She looks down at us with a smile that is all things...
Lester smiles back and LAUGHS, as ROSE PETALS cover his face.
LESTER (CONT'D) Spec-tac-ular.
A WHITE BMW 328si CONVERTIBLE is parked on the street outside the Burnham's house.
We HEAR girlish LAUGHTER from inside.
Angela is behind the wheel, Jane in the passenger seat.
They're passing a JOINT back and forth.
JANE I'm sorry my dad was so weird tonight.
ANGELA It's okay.
ANGELA I'm used to guys drooling over me.
ANGELA It started when I was about twelve, I'd go out to dinner with my parents.
ANGELA Every Thursday night, Red Lobster.
ANGELA And every guy there would stare at me when I walked in.
ANGELA And I knew what they were thinking.
ANGELA Just like I knew guys at school thought about me when they jerked off.
JANE Vomit.
ANGELA No, I liked it.
ANGELA And I still like it.
ANGELA If people I don't even know look at me and want to fuck me, it means I really have a shot at being a model.
ANGELA Which is great, because there's nothing worse in life than being ordinary.
An awkward beat.
Jane stares at the floor.
JANE I really think it'll happen for you.
ANGELA Oh, I know.
ANGELA Because everything that was meant to happen, does.
ANGELA Eventually.
On VIDEO: Jane gets out of the car, still LAUGHING, and waves as Angela pulls away.
We ZOOM toward Jane as she walks up the driveway.
She turns suddenly, sensing our presence.
Her POV: We're looking at the COLONIAL HOUSE next door where the moving van was parked earlier.
The front porch is shrouded in darkness...
then a PORCH LIGHT abruptly reveals Ricky.
As usual, he's dressed conservatively.
There is a BEEPER attached to his belt, and his DIGICAM dangles loosely around his neck.
Irritated, Jane stares at him, hard.
JANE Asshole.
He looks back at her curiously, then raises his Digicam and starts to videotape her.
His POV, on VIDEO: Jane, angry and self-conscious, turns and walks quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes.
Jane enters, closes and locks the door.
She quickly TURNS OFF THE LIGHT that's been left on for her, then peeks through a window.
Her POV: There's no sign of Ricky.
Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing...
and smiles.
CLOSE on an ADDRESS BOOK: A man's hand flips to the H page and then his finger stops at the name Angela Hayes.
Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book.
We HEAR the SHOWER running in the adjacent bathroom.
He grabs Jane's phone and dials, then stands with the receiver to his ear, nervous.
ANGELA Hello?
ANGELA Hello?
Lester is frozen, unable to speak.
Suddenly, the SHOWER is turned off in the next room.
Lester hangs up and exits quickly.
A moment, then the PHONE RINGS.
Jane emerges from the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her wet hair.
She picks up the PHONE.
JANE Hello?
Angela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone.
ANGELA Why'd you call me?
JANE I didn't.
ANGELA Well, my phone just rang and I answered it and somebody hung up and then I star sixty-nined and it called you back.
JANE I was in the shower.
Then Jane notices her address book open to the H page.
JANE (CONT'D) Oh, gross.
On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's WINDOW, looking in.
Jane picks up the address book, frowning.
She speaks into the phone, but we can't hear her.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) Rick-y!
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) Break-fast!
Ricky stands at his window, videotaping.
He lowers his Digicam, but his eyes remain locked on Jane across the way.
RICKY Be right there.
BARBARA FITTS stands at the stove, flipping bacon strips mechanically, her eyes focused elsewhere.
At least ten years younger than her husband, she's pretty in a June Cleaver-ish way.
The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street Journal.
Ricky enters.
RICKY Mom.
Startled, Barbara turns to him.
BARBARA Hello.
As she attempts to serve him bacon:
RICKY I don't eat bacon, remember?
BARBARA I'm sorry, I must have forgotten.
Ricky serves himself scrambled eggs from another pan, then joins his father at the table.
RICKY What's new in the world, Dad?
COLONEL This country is going straight to hell.
A DOORBELL rings.
The Colonel and Barbara look at each other, alarmed.
COLONEL (CONT'D) Are you expecting anyone?
BARBARA No.
BARBARA No.
The Colonel heads toward the living room, a little puffed up.
The Colonel opens the front door to reveal the two JIMS.
JIM #1 Hi.
JIM #2 Welcome to the neighborhood.
Jim #1 holds out a basket filled with flowers, vegetables and a small white cardboard box tied with raffia.
JIM #1 Just a little something from our garden.
JIM #2 Except for the pasta, we got that at Fallaci's.
JIM #1 It's unbelievably fresh.
JIM #1 You just drop it in the water and it's done.
The Colonel stares at them, suspicious.
JIM #1 (CONT'D) Jim Olmeyer.
JIM #1 (CONT'D) Two doors down.
JIM #1 (CONT'D) Welcome to the neighborhood.
COLONEL Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.
JIM #1 Nice to meet you.
JIM #1 And this is my partner...
JIM #2 Jim Berkley, but people call me J.B.
COLONEL Let's cut to the chase, okay?
COLONEL What are you guys selling?
JIM #2 Nothing.
JIM #2 We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors--
COLONEL Yeah, yeah, yeah.
COLONEL But you said you're partners.
COLONEL So what's your business?
The Jims look at each other, then back at the Colonel.
JIM #1 Well, he's a tax attorney.
JIM #2 And he's an anesthesiologist.
The Colonel looks at them, confused.
Then it dawns on him.
The Colonel drives, staring darkly at the road ahead.
In the passenger seat, Ricky is using a CALCULATOR and jotting numbers down in a NOTEBOOK.
COLONEL How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face?
COLONEL How can they be so shameless?
RICKY That's the whole thing, Dad.
RICKY They don't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of.
The Colonel looks at Ricky sharply.
COLONEL Well, it is.
A beat, as Ricky continues his calculations, before he realizes a response is expected from him.
Then:
RICKY Yeah, you're right.
The Colonel's eyes flash angrily.
COLONEL Don't placate me like I'm your mother, boy.
Ricky sighs, then looks at his father.
RICKY Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly, but those fags make me want to puke my fucking guts out.
The Colonel is taken aback but quickly covers.
COLONEL Me too, son.
COLONEL Me too.
Case closed, Ricky goes back to his calculations.
CLOSE on the pencil in his hands: He's totaling two columns of NUMBERS.
Under the column "Income" he writes in swift, bold strokes: $24,950.00.
Jane and Angela are standing with two other TEENAGE GIRLS.
ANGELA I'm serious, he just pulled down his pants and yanked it out.
ANGELA You know, like, say hello to Mr. Happy.
Gross.
ANGELA It wasn't gross.
ANGELA It was kind of cool.
So, did you do it with him?
ANGELA Of course I did.
ANGELA He is a really well- known photographer?
ANGELA He shoots for Elle on like, a regular basis?
ANGELA It would have been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.
You are a total prostitute.
ANGELA Hey.
ANGELA That's how things really are.
ANGELA You just don't know, because you're this pampered little suburban chick.
So are you.
You've only been in Seventeen once, and you looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn Christy Turlington.
The two TEENAGE GIRLS move away from Jane and Angela.
ANGELA Cunt!
ANGELA I am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me.
The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out.
JANE Oh my God.
JANE That's the pervert who filmed me last night.
ANGELA Him?
ANGELA Jane.
ANGELA No way.
ANGELA He's a total lunatic.
JANE You know him?
ANGELA Yeah.
ANGELA We were on the same lunch shift when I was in ninth grade, and he would always say the most random, weird things, and then one day, he was just like, gone.
ANGELA And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his parents had to put him in a mental institution.
JANE Why?
JANE What did he do?
ANGELA What do you mean?
JANE Well, they can't put you away just for saying weird things.
Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile.
ANGELA You total slut.
ANGELA You've got a crush on him.
JANE What?
JANE Please.
ANGELA You were defending him!
ANGELA You love him.
ANGELA You want to have like, ten thousand of his babies.
JANE Shut up.
Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her.
RICKY Hi.
RICKY My name's Ricky.
RICKY I just moved next door to you.
JANE I know.
JANE I kinda remember this really creepy incident when you were filming me last night?
RICKY I didn't mean to scare you.
RICKY I just think you're interesting.
Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it.
JANE Thanks, but I really don't need to have some psycho obsessing about me right now.
RICKY I'm not obsessing.
RICKY I'm just curious.
He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers.
Jane is unnerved and has to look away.
Ricky smiles and walks off.
ANGELA What a freak.
ANGELA And why does he dress like a Bible salesman?
JANE He's like, so confident.
JANE That can't be real.
ANGELA I don't believe him.
ANGELA I mean, he didn't even like, look at me once.
CLOSE on a TV SCREEN: "Hogan's Heroes" on Nick at Nite.
The Colonel and Barbara are seated on a couch, watching television.
The Colonel is smiling, enjoying the show; Barbara just stares.
The Colonel CHUCKLES at a joke and startles her.
We HEAR a door opening elsewhere in the house, and Ricky enters.
RICKY Hey.
He sits on the couch, next to his father, and watches TV along with them.
The Colonel's smile fades.
BARBARA I'm sorry, what?
RICKY Mom.
RICKY Nobody said anything.
BARBARA Oh.
BARBARA I'm sorry.
The three of them stare at the TV, like strangers in an airport.
We HEAR MUSIC under a room full of people all talking at once, as Lester and Carolyn enter a hotel ballroom.
We FOLLOW THEM as they pass a SIGN that reads:
CAROLYN --everyone here is with their spouse or their significant other.
CAROLYN How would it look if I showed up with no one?
LESTER Well, you always end up ignoring me and going off--
Inside the ballroom, well-dressed real estate professionals stand in clumps, chatting.
Catering waiters serve hors d'eouvres.
CAROLYN Now listen to me.
CAROLYN This is an important business function.
CAROLYN As you know, my business is selling an image.
CAROLYN And part of my job is to live that image--
LESTER Just say whatever you want to say and spare me the propaganda.
CAROLYN Hi, Shirley!
CAROLYN Listen, just do me a favor.
CAROLYN Act happy tonight?
LESTER I am happy, honey.
Carolyn's jaw tightens, then:
CAROLYN Oh!
CAROLYN Buddy!
She drags Lester toward a silver-haired MAN and his much younger WIFE.
We recognize the Man as BUDDY KANE, The Real Estate King.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Buddy!
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Buddy.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Hi!
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Good to see you again.
BUDDY It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
CAROLYN Carolyn.
BUDDY Carolyn!
BUDDY Of course.
BUDDY How are you?
CAROLYN Very well, thank you.
CAROLYN Hello, Christy.
CHRISTY Hello.
CAROLYN My husband, Lester--
BUDDY It's a pleasure.
LESTER Oh, we've met before, actually.
LESTER This thing last year.
LESTER Or the Christmas thing at the Sheraton.
BUDDY Oh, yes.
LESTER It's okay.
LESTER I wouldn't remember me either.
He LAUGHS.
A little too loudly.
Carolyn quickly joins in.
CAROLYN Honey.
CAROLYN Don't be weird.
She smiles her most winning smile at him.
He knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now.
LESTER All right, honey.
LESTER I won't be weird.
LESTER I'll be whatever you want me to be.
And he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex--then turns to the others and grins.
LESTER (CONT'D) We have a very healthy relationship.
BUDDY I see.
Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face.
LESTER Well.
LESTER I don't know about you, but I need a drink.
He crosses off.
Carolyn, Buddy and Christy watch him go.
Lester stands at the bar.
A bartender pours him a drink.
LESTER Whoa.
LESTER Put a little more in there, cowboy.
The bartender complies.
Lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room.
His POV: Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy.
She's on: smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes.
Lester shakes his head.
Ricky approaches him, wearing a waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses.
RICKY Excuse me.
RICKY Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail?
RICKY The house with the red door?
LESTER Yeah.
RICKY I'm Ricky Fitts.
RICKY I just moved into the house next to you.
LESTER Oh.
LESTER Hi, Ricky Fitts.
LESTER I'm Lester Burnham.
RICKY Hi, Lester Burnham.
A beat.
Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp.
Ricky just stands there, watching him.
Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want?
RICKY (CONT'D) Do you party?
LESTER Excuse me?
RICKY Do you get high?
Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued.
Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation.
Christy has wandered off.
Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused.
CAROLYN You know, I probably wouldn't even tell you this if I weren't a little tipsy, but...
CAROLYN I am in complete awe of you.
CAROLYN I mean, your firm is, hands down, the Rolls Royce of local Real Estate firms, and your personal sales record is, is, is very intimidating.
CAROLYN You know, I'd love to sit down with you and just pick your brain, if you'd ever be willing.
CAROLYN I suppose, technically, I'm the "competition," but...
CAROLYN I mean, hey, I don't flatter myself that I'm even in the same league as you...
BUDDY I'd love to.
CAROLYN Really?
BUDDY Absolutely.
BUDDY Call my secretary and have her schedule a lunch.
CAROLYN I'll do that.
CAROLYN Thank you.
They look at each other for a beat, then look away.
This situation is loaded and they both know it.
Ricky and Lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service entrance to the hotel, smoking a JOINT.
LESTER ...did you ever see that movie, where the body's walking around holding its own head?
LESTER And then the head goes down on that babe?
RICKY Re-Animator.
Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a large CATERING BOSS in a cheap suit peers out at them.
Ricky hides the joint.
CATERING BOSS Look.
CATERING BOSS I'm not paying you to...
CATERING BOSS ...do whatever it is you're doing out here.
RICKY Fine.
RICKY So don't pay me.
CATERING BOSS Excuse me?
RICKY I quit.
RICKY So you don't have to pay me.
RICKY Now, leave me alone.
CATERING BOSS Asshole.
He goes back inside.
Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs.
LESTER I think you just became my personal hero.
LESTER Doesn't that make you nervous, just quitting your job like that?
LESTER Well, I guess when you're all of, what?
LESTER Sixteen?
RICKY Eighteen.
RICKY I just do these gigs as a cover.
RICKY I have other sources of income.
RICKY But my dad interferes less in my life when I pretend to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job.
CAROLYN (O.C.) Lester?
Carolyn is standing in the open service entrance.
Lester quickly hides the joint behind his back.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) What are you doing?
LESTER Honey, this is...
LESTER Ricky Fitts.
LESTER This is Ricky Fitts.
RICKY I'm Ricky Fitts, I just moved in the house next to you.
RICKY I go to school with your daughter.
LESTER With Jane?
LESTER Really?
RICKY Yeah.
RICKY Jane.
CAROLYN Hi.
CAROLYN I'm ready to go.
CAROLYN I'll meet you out front.
And she goes back inside.
LESTER Uh-oh.
LESTER I'm in trouble.
LESTER Nice meeting you, Ricky Fitts.
LESTER Thanks for the, uh, thing.
RICKY Any time.
Lester goes inside.
RICKY (CONT'D) Lester.
RICKY (CONT'D) If you want any more, you know where I live.
Jane and Angela are watching MTV.
We HEAR the back door open.
JANE Oh, shit.
JANE They're home.
JANE Quick, let's go up to my room.
Jane switches off the TV.
ANGELA I should say hi to your dad.
ANGELA I don't want to be rude.
She starts toward the kitchen.
Jane doesn't like this.
Lester enters and opens the refrigerator.
ANGELA (O.C.) Nice suit.
He turns, and is instantly transfixed by:
His POV: Angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair.
ANGELA (CONT'D) You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.
She starts toward him.
ANGELA (CONT'D) Last time I saw you, you looked kind of wound up.
ANGELA (CONT'D) Ooh, is that root beer?
She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle.
As she does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder.
He sees it coming.
Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all sound FADES...
EXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches his shoulder in SLOW MOTION.
We HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its unnatural, hollow ECHO...
BACK IN REAL TIME: She grabs the root beer and smiles at him.
CLOSE on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then:
He cups her face in his hands and kisses her.
She seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him with surprising strength.
He breaks the kiss, looking at her in awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips.
His eyes widen as he pulls a ROSE PETAL from his mouth right before we SMASH
Angela is back against the counter, drinking the root beer.
Lester stands by the refrigerator, gazing at her, still lost in fantasy.
ANGELA I love root beer, don't you?
Jane watches from the doorway to the family room, feeling incredibly awkward in her own home.
Carolyn enters from the dining room.
Lester snaps out of it and grabs a root beer from the refrigerator.
JANE Mom, you remember Angela.
CAROLYN Yes, of course!
JANE I forgot to tell you, she's spending the night.
JANE Is that okay?
LESTER Sure!
He takes a sip of his root beer, but it goes down the wrong way and he starts COUGHING violently.
Angela lays on the bed, in bra and panties, reading a magazine.
Jane, in an oversized T shirt, plays a video game on her computer.
JANE I'm sorry about my dad.
ANGELA Don't be.
ANGELA I think it's funny.
JANE Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who wants to jump your bones.
JANE But to me...
JANE he's just too embarrassing to live.
ANGELA Your mom's the one who's embarrassing.
ANGELA What a phony.
Jane glances at Angela, irritated.
ANGELA (CONT'D) Your dad's actually kind of cute.
JANE Shut up.
Lester, still in his suit, stands outside Jane's room, his ear up against the door.
He can't believe what he's hearing.
ANGELA (O.C.) He is.
ANGELA (O.C.) If he just worked out a little, he'd be hot.
JANE Shut up.
ANGELA Oh, come on.
ANGELA Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in his underwear?
ANGELA I bet he's got a big dick.
JANE You are so grossing me out right now.
ANGELA If he built up his chest and arms, I would totally fuck him.
Jane covers her ears and starts SINGING to drown her out.
Lester, still listening, looks like he's about to implode.
ANGELA (O.C.) I would!
ANGELA (O.C.) I would suck your dad's big fat dick, and then I would fuck him 'til his eyes rolled back in his head!
ANGELA (O.C.) What was that noise?
ANGELA (O.C.) Jane.
Jane's SINGING stops.
ANGELA (O.C.) (CONT'D) I swear I heard something.
Panicked, Lester scurries down the hall.
JANE Yeah, it was the sound of you being a huge disgusting pig.
ANGELA I'm serious.
We HEAR the sharp TAP of a penny being thrown against glass.
ANGELA (CONT'D) See?
Angela crosses to the window and looks out.
ANGELA (CONT'D) Oh my God.
ANGELA (CONT'D) Jane.
We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear, looking down at us.
Jane joins her and is immediately unnerved by:
Their POV: In the Burnham's DRIVEWAY, the word "JANE" is spelled out in FIRE.
ANGELA It's that psycho next door.
ANGELA Jane, what if he worships you?
ANGELA What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff?
JANE Shit.
JANE I bet he's filming us right now.
ANGELA Really?
On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's window, looking in.
Jane tries to shut the drapes, but Angela won't let her.
Irritated, Jane retreats into the room.
We ZOOM toward her, even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not interested in Angela.
The ZOOM continues, searching for Jane, who has disappeared.
Finally, we settle on the small make-up MIRROR where we see a REFLECTION of Jane, back at her computer.
She's smiling.
Then suddenly the DRAPES CLOSE and she's gone.
Ricky sits in darkness with his DIGICAM, videotaping.
He lowers the camera and smiles...
then something below catches his attention.
He leans out the window to get a better look at:
Ricky's POV: Through a WINDOW on the side of the Burnham's GARAGE DOOR, we see Lester, still in his suit, digging through shelves against the back wall.
Lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves, searching for something as if his very life depended on it.
LESTER Shit.
LESTER Shit!
He yanks aside COLLEGE YEARBOOKS, a racquetball RACQUET, boxes of old HOT ROD MAGAZINES, an unopened remote-controlled MODEL JEEP KIT, stacks of old vinyl LPs...
finally his face lights up when he finds:
A pair of DUMBBELLS obviously unused for many years.
Lester rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt.
He glances around, finding his REFLECTION in the WINDOW as he pulls off his shirt, then the T-shirt underneath.
He eyes himself critically: Angela was right, he's not in bad shape.
Just a few extra pounds around his middle that wouldn't be hard to shed.
He kicks off his shoes and begins to step out of his pants.
Ricky holds his Digicam up and starts to videotape.
Ricky's POV, on VIDEO: Through a WINDOW on the side of the Burnham's garage, we see Lester step out of his pants and briefs.
Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window as he does.
Ricky stands at the window, videotaping.
RICKY Welcome to America's Weirdest Home Videos.
Suddenly we HEAR someone trying to open a locked door.
COLONEL (O.C.) Ricky!
Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a light.
His room is a haven of high-tech.
A state-of-the-art multimedia COMPUTER crowds his desk, and high-end STEREO and VIDEO EQUIPMENT line the shelves, as well as HUNDREDS OF CDs.
There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room.
RICKY Coming, Dad.
COLONEL (O.C.) You know I don't like locked doors in my house, boy.
Ricky opens the door.
The Colonel stands outside, eyeing him.
RICKY I'm sorry, I must have locked it by accident.
RICKY So what's up?
The Colonel holds out a small PLASTIC CUP WITH A CAP.
COLONEL I need a urine sample.
RICKY Wow.
RICKY It's been six months already.
RICKY Can I give it to you in the morning?
RICKY I just took a whiz.
COLONEL Yeah, I suppose.
COLONEL Well.
COLONEL Good night, son.
He disappears down the hall.
Ricky smiles, shuts and locks his door.
He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to a MINI REFRIGERATOR in the corner of his room and takes out a cup-sized TUPPERWARE CONTAINER from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight.
Carolyn lies sleeping.
Lester is awake, staring at the ceiling.
After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom.
Lester enters and switches on the LIGHT.
The room is filled with STEAM.
Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on:
His POV: Across from us, in a PEDESTAL BATHTUB, is Angela.
She smiles and beckons us, and we MOVE CLOSER.
ROSE PETALS float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body.
ANGELA I've been waiting for you.
Lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church.
ANGELA (CONT'D) You've been working out, haven't you?
ANGELA (CONT'D) I can tell.
She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively.
ANGELA (CONT'D) I was hoping you'd give me a bath...
ANGELA (CONT'D) I'm very, very dirty.
Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into the water between her legs.
Her eyes widen and she throws her head back...
and we SMASH CUT TO:
CLOSE on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic BRUSH of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers.
She flips over and faces him.
CAROLYN What are you doing?
A beat.
LESTER Nothing.
Carolyn switches on the bedside LIGHT.
CAROLYN You were masturbating.
LESTER I was not.
CAROLYN Yes, you were.
He turns to her, trying to look innocent, then gives up.
LESTER All right, so shoot me.
LESTER I was whacking off.
Carolyn gets out of bed, repelled.
Lester LAUGHS.
LESTER (CONT'D) That's right.
LESTER (CONT'D) I was choking the bishop.
LESTER (CONT'D) Shaving the carrot.
LESTER (CONT'D) Saying hi to my monster.
CAROLYN That's disgusting.
LESTER Well, excuse me, but I still have blood pumping through my veins!
CAROLYN So do I!
LESTER Really?
LESTER I'm the only one who seems to be doing anything about it.
CAROLYN Lester.
CAROLYN I refuse to live like this.
CAROLYN This is not a marriage.
LESTER This hasn't been a marriage for years.
LESTER But you were happy as long as I kept my mouth shut.
LESTER Well, guess what?
LESTER I've changed.
LESTER And the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because you're obviously not going to help me out in that department.
CAROLYN Oh.
CAROLYN I see.
CAROLYN You think you're the only one who's sexually frustrated?
LESTER I'm not?
LESTER Well then, come on, baby!
LESTER I'm ready.
CAROLYN Do not mess with me, mister, or I will divorce you so fast it'll make your head spin!
LESTER On what grounds?
LESTER I'm not a drunk, I don't fuck other women, I don't mistreat you, I've never hit you, or even tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be.
LESTER But.
LESTER I did support you while you got your license.
LESTER And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours.
She sinks into a chair, stunned.
It's clear he knows where she's most vulnerable.
He sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change.
He curls up under the covers contentedly.
LESTER (CONT'D) Turn out the light when you come to bed, okay?
CLOSE on Lester, smiling.
We're FLYING high above the neighborhood.
Below us we see the two Jims, jogging.
We APPROACH them steadily.
LESTER It's a great thing when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself.
LESTER Makes you wonder what else you can do that you've forgotten about.
We're now at street level, FOLLOWING the two Jims.
LESTER Hey!
LESTER You guys!
Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison, as Lester runs INTO FRAME, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair of faded old sweatpants.
The Jims slow down until he catches up, then the three men run together in the early morning light.
JIM #2 Lester, I didn't know you ran.
LESTER Well, I just started.
JIM #1 Good for you.
LESTER I figured you guys might be able to give me some pointers.
LESTER I need to shape up.
LESTER Fast.
JIM #1 Well, are you just looking to lose weight, or do you want have increased strength and flexibility as well?
LESTER I want to look good naked.
The Colonel is washing his Ford Explorer, squatting to scrub the bumper, when something Catches his eye:
His POV: Lester and the Jims jog down the street.
The Colonel stands, scowling, as Ricky comes out of the house, holding the URINE SAMPLE in front of him.
COLONEL What is this, the fucking gay pride parade?
Lester breaks off from the two Jims and jogs up to Ricky and the Colonel, out of breath.
He grabs hold of his knees and bends over, panting.
LESTER Hey!
LESTER Yo!
LESTER Ricky!
LESTER My entire life is passing before my eyes, and those two have barely broken a sweat.
He LAUGHS, and extends his hand to the Colonel.
LESTER (CONT'D) Sorry, hi.
LESTER (CONT'D) Lester Burnham, I live next door.
LESTER (CONT'D) We haven't met.
COLONEL COLONEL Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.
LESTER Whoa.
LESTER Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.
He salutes the Colonel good-naturedly, grinning.
The Colonel doesn't think it's funny.
An awkward beat.
LESTER (CONT'D) So, Ricky, uh, I was thinking about the, uh...
LESTER (CONT'D) I was gonna...
LESTER (CONT'D) the movie we talked about...
RICKY Re-Animator.
LESTER Yeah!
RICKY You want to borrow it?
RICKY Okay, it's up in my room.
RICKY Come on.
He heads into the house.
Lester waves at the Colonel, then follows him.
The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark.
Ricky enters, followed by Lester.
RICKY Can you hold this for a sec?
LESTER Sure.
He gives the URINE SPECIMEN to Lester, then locks the door.
RICKY I don't think my dad would try to come in when somebody else is here, but you never know.
Ricky crosses to a bureau and opens a DRAWER.
He takes clothing out and piles it on his bed.
LESTER What is this?
RICKY Urine.
RICKY I have to take a drug test every six months to make sure I'm clean.
LESTER Are you kidding?
LESTER You just smoked with me last night.
RICKY It's not mine.
RICKY One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office.
RICKY I cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.
Lester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it.
LESTER You like Pink Floyd?
RICKY I like a lot of music.
LESTER Man, I haven't listened to this album in years.
He shakes his head, then puts the CD case down.
Ricky, having emptied the drawer, now removes a FALSE BOTTOM, revealing rows of MARIJUANA, tightly packed in ZIP-LOC BAGS.
RICKY How much do you want?
LESTER I don't know, it's been a while.
LESTER How much is an ounce?
RICKY Well, this is totally decent, and it's three hundred.
LESTER Wow.
RICKY But this shit is top of the line.
RICKY It's called G-13.
RICKY Genetically engineered by the U.S. Government.
RICKY Extremely potent.
RICKY But a completely mellow high, no paranoia.
LESTER Is that what we smoked last night?
RICKY This is all I ever smoke.
LESTER How much?
RICKY Two grand.
LESTER Jesus.
LESTER Things have changed since 1973.
RICKY You don't have to pay now.
RICKY I know you're good for it.
A beat.
LESTER Thanks.
RICKY There's a card in there with my beeper number, call me anytime day or night.
RICKY And I only accept cash.
LESTER Well, now I know how you can afford all this equipment.
LESTER When I was your age, I flipped burgers all summer just to be able to buy an eight track.
RICKY That sucks.
LESTER No actually, it was great.
LESTER All I did was party and get laid.
LESTER I had my whole life ahead of me...
RICKY My dad thinks I pay for all this with catering jobs.
RICKY Never underestimate the power of denial.
Lester smiles.
This kid's cool.
Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut ROSES, passes by the GARAGE WINDOW.
From inside the garage, we HEAR ROCK MUSIC.
Carolyn stops and SNIFFS the air, frowning.
She peers through the window.
Her POV: Lester, in a T-shirt and gym shorts, lies on a new WEIGHT BENCH, doing bench presses with shiny new BARBELLS.
ROCK MUSIC blasts from a new BOOMBOX on the floor.
The garage is in the process of becoming Lester's sanctuary.
An ugly but comfortable 70's BOWL CHAIR has been pulled out and cleaned off, his old hot rod magazines strewn across it, and the remote-controlled MODEL JEEP KIT is spread across a card table.
The SHELVES that Lester tore through earlier have been dismantled, leaving a blank wall on which now hangs a
Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the weights in their rack and sits up.
As he takes a drag off a joint, the GARAGE DOOR suddenly starts to open.
Lester looks up, squinting at:
His POV: The door raises to reveal Carolyn, silhouetted against the bright sunlight outside, pointing a REMOTE at us.
LESTER Uh-oh, mom's mad.
CAROLYN What the hell do you think you're doing?
LESTER Bench presses.
LESTER I'm going to wail on my pecs, and then I'm going to do my back.
CAROLYN I see you're smoking pot now.
CAROLYN I'm so glad.
CAROLYN I think using illegal psychotropic substances is a very positive example to set for our daughter.
LESTER You're one to talk, you bloodless, money- grubbing freak.
CAROLYN Lester.
CAROLYN You have such hostility in you!
LESTER Do you mind?
LESTER I'm trying to work out here.
LESTER Unless you want to spot me.
CAROLYN You will not get away with this.
CAROLYN You can be sure of that!
And she's gone.
Lester leans back on the bench and grabs the weights.
LESTER That's.
LESTER What.
LESTER You.
LESTER Think.
Brad is seated behind his desk, reading a document.
Lester sits across from him, smiling.
BRAD "...my job consists of basically masking my contempt for the assholes in charge, and, at least once a day, retiring to the men's room so I can jerk off, while I fantasize about a life that doesn't so closely resemble hell."
BRAD Well, you obviously have no interest in saving yourself.
LESTER Brad, for fourteen years I've been a whore for the advertising industry.
LESTER The only way I could save myself now is if I start firebombing.
BRAD Whatever.
BRAD Management wants you gone by the end of the day.
LESTER Well, just what sort of severance package is "management" prepared to offer me?
LESTER (CONT'D) Considering the information I have about our editorial director buying pussy with company money.
A beat.
LESTER (CONT'D) Which I'm sure would interest the I.R.S., since it technically constitutes fraud.
LESTER (CONT'D) And I'm sure that some of our advertisers and rival publications might like to know about it as well.
LESTER (CONT'D) Not to mention, Craig's wife.
Brad sighs.
BRAD What do you want?
LESTER One year's salary, with benefits.
BRAD That's not going to happen.
LESTER Well, what do you say I throw in a little sexual harassment charge to boot?
Brad LAUGHS.
BRAD Against who?
LESTER Against you.
Brad stops laughing.
LESTER (CONT'D) Can you prove you didn't offer to save my job if I'd let you blow me?
Brad leans back in his chair, studying Lester.
BRAD Man.
BRAD You are one twisted fuck.
LESTER Nope.
LESTER I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose.
Exhilarated, Lester walks down a corridor, his belongings in a box on his shoulder.
He's happier than he's been in years.
LESTER Yeah!
Carolyn sits at a table, lost in thought.
There are two menus on the table.
After a moment, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King, joins her.
Carolyn immediately becomes warm and gracious.
BUDDY Carolyn.
CAROLYN Buddy.
Carolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name.
BUDDY I'm so sorry I kept you waiting.
BUDDY Christy left for New York this morning, and...
BUDDY let's just say things were very hectic around the house.
CAROLYN What's she doing in New York?
BUDDY She's moving there.
BUDDY Yes.
BUDDY We are splitting up.
CAROLYN Buddy.
CAROLYN I'm so sorry.
BUDDY Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on my career.
BUDDY As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw.
BUDDY Well, she certainly knew how to take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her.
BUDDY Oh.
BUDDY Wow.
BUDDY Ah, it's for the best.
CAROLYN When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy.
BUDDY Well, call me crazy, but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success, at all times.
He smiles, then opens his menu.
Carolyn picks hers up mechanically, but continues to stare at him, enraptured, like a fervent Christian who's just come face to face with Jesus.
Ricky stands with his DIGICAM, videotaping something on the ground at his feet.
On VIDEO: A DEAD BIRD lays on the ground, decomposing.
ANGELA (O.C.) What are you doing?
On VIDEO: The camera JERKS up to discover Jane and Angela staring at us.
RICKY (O.C.) I was filming this dead bird.
ANGELA Why?
RICKY (O.C.) Because it's beautiful.
On VIDEO: Angela looks at Jane, trying not to laugh.
ANGELA I think maybe you forgot your medication today, mental boy.
On VIDEO: She falls out of frame as we ZOOM toward Jane.
RICKY (O.C.) Hi, Jane.
JANE Look.
JANE I want you to stop filming me.
Ricky lowers the Digicam.
RICKY Okay.
He looks at her, curious, his eyes searching hers.
She doesn't look away.
ANGELA Well, whatever.
ANGELA This is boring.
ANGELA Let's go.
JANE Do you need a ride?
ANGELA Are you crazy?
ANGELA I don't want to end up hacked to pieces in a dumpster somewhere.
RICKY It's okay.
RICKY I'll walk.
RICKY But thanks.
ANGELA Yeah, see?
ANGELA He doesn't want to go anyway.
ANGELA C'mon, let's go.
Angela starts off, but Jane doesn't follow.
Ricky smiles at her.
She almost smiles back, then:
JANE I think I'm going to walk, too.
Angela stops and stares at her.
ANGELA What?
ANGELA Jane, that's like, almost a mile.
Carolyn's Mercedes is parked next to a JAGUAR CONVERTIBLE with a VANITY LICENSE PLATE that reads "R E KING."
Carolyn and Buddy are in the middle of sex.
CAROLYN Yes!
CAROLYN Oh, God!
CAROLYN I love it!
BUDDY You like getting nailed by the king?
CAROLYN Oh yes!
CAROLYN I love it!
CAROLYN Fuck me, your majesty!
Lester's TOYOTA CAMRY cruises through the streets.
We hear Lester SINGING along to "AMERICAN WOMAN" on the STEREO.
Lester is driving, smoking a joint.
Lester continues singing along to "AMERICAN WOMAN," as the Camry pulls into the parking lot of a FAST FOOD RESTAURANT.
Lester pulls up to the drive-thru speaker box.
DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.C.) Smile you're at Mr. Smiley's.
Lester turns down the volume on the stereo.
LESTER What?
DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.C.) Would you like to try our new bacon and egg fajita just a dollar twenty-nine for a limited time only.
LESTER Uh...
LESTER no.
LESTER But thank you.
LESTER I'll have a Big Barn Burger, Smiley fries, and an orange soda.
DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.C.) Please drive up to the window, thank you.
He pulls the car around to the WINDOW, where a teenage GIRL wearing a headset is waiting.
DRIVE-THRU GIRL (CONT'D) Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's, that'll be four eighty-nine, please.
Lester pays her.
As she hands him his food, he notices a SIGN in the corner of the window that reads:
COUNTER GIRL Would you like some Smiley Sauce?
LESTER No.
LESTER No, actually...
LESTER I'd like to fill out an application.
She stares at him, confused by his age and attire.
COUNTER GIRL There's not jobs for manager, it's just for counter.
LESTER Good.
LESTER I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility.
Lester sits at a booth with the MANAGER, a greasy kid wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a tie covered with the Mr.
Smiley's logo.
He looks over Lester's application, baffled.
MANAGER I don't think you'd fit in here.
LESTER I have fast food experience.
MANAGER Yeah, like twenty years ago.
LESTER Well, I'm sure there have been amazing technological advances in the industry, but surely you have some sort of training process.
LESTER It seems unfair to presume I won't be able to learn.
The Manager sighs and runs a hand through his greasy hair, wondering what he could possibly have done to deserve this.
Carolyn and Buddy are in bed, post-sex.
CAROLYN That was exactly what I needed.
CAROLYN The royal treatment, so to speak.
They laugh.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) I was so stressed out.
BUDDY Know what I do when I feel like that?
CAROLYN What?
BUDDY I fire a gun.
Carolyn sits up, eager to learn from the master.
CAROLYN Really.
BUDDY Oh yeah, I go to this little firing range downtown, and I just pop off a few rounds.
CAROLYN I've never fired a gun before.
BUDDY Oh, you've gotta try it.
BUDDY Nothing makes you feel more powerful.
BUDDY Well, almost nothing.
Carolyn is quick to pick up her cue and kisses him, ready for another round.
Ricky and Jane walk along without speaking.
He seems comfortable with the silence; she doesn't.
After a beat:
JANE So how do you like your new house?
RICKY I like it.
A beat.
JANE The people who used to live there fed these stray cats, so they were always around, and it drove my mother nuts.
JANE And then she cut down their tree.
An automobile FUNERAL PROCESSION appears and begins to pass them slowly.
RICKY Have you ever known anybody who died?
JANE No.
JANE Have you?
RICKY No, but I did see this homeless woman who froze to death once.
RICKY Just laying there on the sidewalk.
RICKY She looked really sad.
They watch the FUNERAL CARS pass.
RICKY (CONT'D) I got that homeless woman on video.
JANE Why would you film that?
RICKY Because it was amazing.
JANE What was amazing about it?
A beat.
RICKY When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second.
RICKY And if you're careful, you can look right back.
JANE And what do you see?
RICKY Beauty.
Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space as if hypnotized.
Behind her, Ricky enters, followed by Jane.
RICKY Mom, I want you to meet somebody.
RICKY Mom.
Barbara's eyes flutter and she turns to him slowly.
BARBARA Yes?
RICKY I want you to meet somebody.
RICKY This is Jane.
JANE Hi.
BARBARA Oh, my.
BARBARA I apologize for the way things look around here.
Jane glances around.
The room is spotless.
We HEAR KEYS TURNING in the lock, then the door opens and Ricky enters, holding a RING OF KEYS, followed by Jane.
RICKY This is where my dad hides out.
GLASS CASES filled with GUNS line the walls.
JANE I take it he's got a thing for guns.
Ricky crosses to a built-in CABINET behind the desk.
RICKY You got to see this one thing...
He unlocks the cabinet and opens it, revealing shelves stacked with WAR MEMORABILIA.
RICKY (CONT'D) My dad would kill me if he knew I was in here.
JANE Did you steal his keys?
RICKY No.
RICKY One of my clients is a locksmith.
RICKY He was short on cash one night, so I let him pay me in trade.
He reaches into the cabinet and carefully removes an oval CHINA PLATTER, which he hands to Jane.
She examines it.
RICKY (CONT'D) Turn it over.
CLOSE on the bottom of the plate: A small SWASTIKA is imprinted in the center.
JANE Oh my God.
RICKY It's like official state china of the Third Reich.
RICKY There's a whole subculture of people who collect this Nazi shit.
RICKY But my dad just has this one thing.
He puts the platter back into the cabinet and shuts the door, then notices Jane looking at him oddly.
RICKY (CONT'D) What's wrong?
JANE Nothing.
RICKY No, you're scared of me.
JANE No I'm not.
But she is.
Ricky studies her.
RICKY You want to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed?
On VIDEO: We're in an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day.
Something is floating across from us...
it's an empty, wrinkled, white PLASTIC BAG.
We follow it as the wind carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...
Jane and Ricky sit on the bed, watching his WIDE-SCREEN TV.
RICKY It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing.
RICKY And there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it, right?
RICKY And this bag was just...
RICKY dancing with me.
RICKY Like a little kid begging me to play with it.
RICKY For fifteen minutes.
RICKY That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid.
RICKY Ever.
A beat.
RICKY (CONT'D) Video's a poor excuse, I know.
RICKY (CONT'D) But it helps me remember...
RICKY (CONT'D) I need to remember...
Now Jane is watching him.
RICKY (CONT'D) Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it...
RICKY (CONT'D) and my heart is going to cave in.
After a moment, Jane takes his hand.
Then she leans in and kisses him softly on the lips.
His eyes scan hers, curious to see how she reacts to this...
JANE Oh my God.
JANE What time is it?
Lester sits at the table in sloppy clothes, eating his dinner voraciously and drinking beer from a bottle.
Across from him, Carolyn picks at her food, watching him with contempt.
EASY- LISTENING MUSIC plays on the STEREO.
We HEAR the back door SLAM, then Jane enters and quickly takes her seat at the table.
JANE Sorry I'm late.
CAROLYN No, no, that's quite all right, dear.
CAROLYN Your father and I were just discussing his day at work.
CAROLYN Why don't you tell our daughter about it, honey?
Jane stares at both her parents, apprehensive.
Lester looks at Carolyn darkly, then flashes a "you-asked-for-it" grin.
LESTER Janie, today I quit my job.
LESTER And then I told my boss to fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand dollars.
LESTER Pass the asparagus.
CAROLYN Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of.
LESTER And your mother seems to prefer I go through life like a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar under the sink.
CAROLYN How dare you speak to me that way in front of her?
CAROLYN And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me, on the same day that you lose your job!
LESTER Lose it?
LESTER I didn't lose it.
LESTER It's not like, "Oops, where'd my job go?" I quit.
LESTER Someone pass me the asparagus.
CAROLYN Oh!
CAROLYN Oh!
CAROLYN And I want to thank you for putting me under the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner now--
LESTER I already have a job.
CAROLYN No, no, don't give a second thought as to who's going to pay the mortgage.
CAROLYN We'll just leave it all up to Carolyn.
CAROLYN You mean, you're going to take care of everything now, Carolyn?
CAROLYN Yes.
CAROLYN I don't mind.
CAROLYN I really don't.
CAROLYN You mean, everything?
CAROLYN You don't mind having the sole responsibility, your husband feels he can just quit his job--
LESTER Will someone pass me the fucking asparagus?
JANE Okay, I'm not going to be a part of this--
LESTER Sit down.
Jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice.
Lester gets up, crosses to the other side of the table to get a PLATE OF ASPARAGUS, then sits again as he serves himself.
LESTER (CONT'D) I'm sick and tired of being treated like I don't exist.
LESTER (CONT'D) You two do whatever you want to do whenever you want to do it and I don't complain.
LESTER (CONT'D) All I want is the same courtesy--
CAROLYN Oh, you don't complain?
CAROLYN Oh, excuse me.
CAROLYN Excuse me.
CAROLYN I must be psychotic then, if you don't complain.
CAROLYN What is this?!
CAROLYN Am I locked away in a padded cell somewhere, hallucinating?
CAROLYN That's the only explanation I can think of--
Lester hurls the plate of asparagus against the wall with such force it SHATTERS, frightening Carolyn and Jane.
LESTER Don't interrupt me, honey.
He goes back to eating his meal, as if nothing unusual has happened.
Carolyn sits in her chair, shivering with rage.
Jane just stares at the plate in front of her.
LESTER (CONT'D) Oh, and another thing.
LESTER (CONT'D) From now on, we're going to alternate our dinner music.
LESTER (CONT'D) Because frankly, and I don't think I'm alone here, I'm really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit.
Jane is sitting on her bed.
There is a KNOCK at the door.
JANE Go.
JANE Away.
CAROLYN (O.C.) Honey, please let me in.
Jane rolls her eyes, crosses to the door and lets Carolyn in.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) I wish that you hadn't witnessed that awful scene tonight.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) But in a way, I'm glad.
JANE Why, so I could see what freaks you and Dad really are?
CAROLYN Me?
She stares at Jane, then starts to cry.
JANE Aw, Christ, Mom.
CAROLYN No, I'm glad because you're old enough now to learn the most important lesson in life: you cannot count on anyone except yourself.
CAROLYN You cannot count on anyone except yourself.
CAROLYN It's sad, but true, and the sooner you learn it, the better.
JANE Look, Mom, I really don't feel like having a Kodak moment here, okay?
Carolyn suddenly SLAPS Jane, hard.
CAROLYN You ungrateful little brat.
CAROLYN Just look at everything you have.
CAROLYN When I was your age, I lived in a duplex.
CAROLYN We didn't even have our own house.
Embarrassed, she quickly leaves.
Jane looks in a mirror and rubs her cheek, then crosses to the window and looks out.
Jane's POV: We're across from Ricky's room, looking in.
He stands at the window with his DIGICAM, videotaping us.
On the WIDE-SCREEN TV behind him, we see Jane standing in her window as she looks across at him.
She waves.
Ricky just keeps videotaping.
A beat, then she starts to take off her shirt.
We're behind Ricky as he videotapes Jane in her window.
She has now removed her shirt.
She stands there in her bra, then reaches behind her back to unhook the bra.
On VIDEO: We ZOOM toward her as she takes off her bra clumsily.
She's obviously embarrassed, but she's gone this far and there's no turning back.
She stands there with her breasts exposed, trying to look defiant, but she's achingly vulnerable...
Suddenly, the door is thrown open and the Colonel enters, incensed.
Startled, Ricky turns around.
As soon as his eyes meet his father's, he knows what's up.
COLONEL You little bastard--
Ricky scrambles to dodge his father, but the Colonel is too fast; he punches Ricky in the face, knocking him to the floor.
COLONEL (CONT'D) How did you get in there?
From her window, Jane watches, pulling the drapes in front of her.
Jane's POV: In the WINDOW across from us, the Colonel proceeds to give Ricky a serious beating, punching his face.
Ricky's lip is bleeding, but he maintains a steady gaze at his father during this violence.
COLONEL How!?
COLONEL How?!
COLONEL C'mon, get up!
COLONEL Fight back, you little pussy!
RICKY No, sir.
RICKY I won't fight you.
The Colonel grabs him by the collar.
COLONEL How did you get in there?
RICKY I picked the lock, sir.
COLONEL What were you looking for?
COLONEL Money?
COLONEL Are you on dope again?
RICKY No, sir.
RICKY I wanted to show my girlfriend your Nazi plate.
A beat.
COLONEL Girlfriend?
RICKY Yes, sir.
RICKY She lives next door.
The Colonel glances toward the window.
His POV: In the WINDOW across from us, Jane peeks out from behind the drape.
She quickly pulls it shut.
RICKY (CONT'D) Her name's Jane.
A beat.
The Colonel is suddenly, deeply shamed.
COLONEL This is for your own good, boy.
COLONEL You have no respect for other people's things, for authority, for...
RICKY Sir, I'm sorry.
COLONEL You can't just go around doing whatever you feel like, you can't--there are rules in life--
RICKY Yes, sir.
COLONEL You need structure, you need discipline--
RICKY Discipline.
RICKY Yes, sir, thank you for trying to teach me.
RICKY Don't give up on me, Dad.
The Colonel stands, still breathing heavily.
Tenderness fills his face, and he reaches out to touch Ricky's cheek.
COLONEL Oh, Ricky...
But something keeps him from doing it.
COLONEL (CONT'D) You stay out of there.
He leaves.
Ricky gets up and goes to his bureau.
He looks at his reflection in the mirror, calmly takes a cloth and starts to wipe the blood from his face.
In darkness, we HEAR repetitive GUNSHOTS.
Carolyn, wearing PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR, is holding a GLOCK 19 AUTOMATIC REVOLVER with both hands, FIRING it directly at us.
She empties a round and stands there, exhilarated.
An ATTENDANT approaches with a new round of ammunition.
ATTENDANT I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham, when you first came here I thought you would be hopeless.
ATTENDANT But you're a natural.
CAROLYN Well, all I know is...
CAROLYN I love shooting this gun!
And she starts FIRING again.
Bobby Darin sings "DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE" on the RADIO.
Carolyn SINGS along as she drives.
Her face has lost its usual resolute determination; she's actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful she is.
ANGLE ON the GLOCK 19 sitting on the passenger seat amidst some CDs.
Carolyn takes the gun and holds it at arm's length, admiring it as she continues to SING.
The Mercedes turns onto Robin Hood Trail.
Carolyn's POV: We turn into the Burnham driveway.
A 1970 PONTIAC FIREBIRD with racing stripes blocks our access to the garage.
CLOSE on Carolyn: She doesn't like having things in her way.
Lester's REMOTE-CONTROLLED MODEL JEEP is zooming across the floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and narrowly avoiding crashing.
Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a BEER and controlling the car.
His working out is beginning to produce results.
The room, too, seems changed: sloppier, more lived in.
Carolyn enters through the kitchen, flushed and angry.
She just stands there, staring at Lester.
After a moment, he looks up at her.
LESTER What?
CAROLYN Ah, whose car is that out front?
LESTER Mine.
LESTER 1970 Pontiac Firebird.
LESTER The car I always wanted and now I have it.
LESTER I rule!
CAROLYN Where's the Camry?
LESTER I traded it in.
CAROLYN Shouldn't you have consulted me first?
LESTER Hmm, let me think...
LESTER No.
LESTER You never drove it.
LESTER Have you done something different?
LESTER You look great.
CAROLYN Where's Jane?
LESTER Jane not home.
LESTER We have the whole house to ourselves.
He smiles at her playfully.
She stares back, annoyed.
It's the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone.
Lester just LAUGHS.
LESTER (CONT'D) Christ, Carolyn.
LESTER (CONT'D) When did you become so...
LESTER (CONT'D) joyless?
CAROLYN Joyless?!
CAROLYN I am not joyless!
CAROLYN There happens to be a lot about me that you don't know, mister smarty man.
CAROLYN There is plenty of joy in my life.
LESTER Whatever happened to that girl who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored?
LESTER And who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building to flash the traffic helicopters?
LESTER Have you totally forgotten about her?
LESTER Because I haven't.
His face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is charged.
She pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's drawn to him.
He smiles, and moves even closer, holding his beer loosely balanced.
Then, just before their lips meet...
CAROLYN Lester.
CAROLYN You're going to spill beer on the couch.
She's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late.
His smile fades, and the moment is gone.
LESTER So what?
LESTER It's just a couch.
CAROLYN This is a four thousand dollar sofa upholstered in Italian silk.
CAROLYN This is not "just a couch."
LESTER It's just a couch!
He stands and gestures toward all the things in the room.
LESTER (CONT'D) This isn't life.
LESTER (CONT'D) This is just stuff.
LESTER (CONT'D) And it's become more important to you than living.
LESTER (CONT'D) Well, honey, that's just nuts.
Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry.
LESTER (CONT'D) I'm only trying to help you.
On VIDEO: Jane lays in Ricky's bed, wearing a tank top.
She glances at us.
JANE Don't.
We're watching the WIDE-SCREEN TV in Ricky's room.
A CORD leads from the TV to Ricky's DIGICAM.
Ricky holds the camera, sitting naked in a chair.
It's been almost a month since his father beat him up, and there are still slight SCARS on his face.
He's aiming his camera at Jane.
RICKY Why?
JANE It's weird, watching myself.
JANE I don't like how I look.
RICKY I can't believe you don't know how beautiful you are.
JANE I'm not going to sit here for that shit.
She gets out of bed, takes his Digicam and focuses it on him.
We see his image on the TV as she videotapes.
JANE (CONT'D) Ha.
JANE (CONT'D) How does it feel now?
RICKY Fine.
JANE You don't feel naked?
RICKY I am naked.
JANE You know what I mean.
Jane ZOOMS in on his face, which remains placid.
JANE (CONT'D) Tell me about being in the hospital.
Ricky smiles.
RICKY When I was fifteen, my dad caught me smoking dope.
RICKY He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school.
RICKY I told you his whole thing about structure and discipline, right?
RICKY Well, of course, I got kicked out.
RICKY Dad and I had this huge fight, and he hit me...
RICKY and then the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut, and...
RICKY I just snapped.
RICKY I wanted to kill him.
RICKY And I would have.
RICKY Killed him.
RICKY If they hadn't pulled me off.
RICKY That's when my dad put me in the hospital.
RICKY Then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years.
JANE Wow.
JANE You must really hate him.
RICKY He's not a bad man.
He grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and lights it.
JANE Well...
JANE you better believe I'd hate my father if he did something like that to me.
JANE Wait.
JANE I do hate my father.
RICKY Why?
He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses it on her.
We see her image on the TV as he videotapes.
JANE He's a total asshole and he's got this crush on my friend Angela and it's disgusting.
RICKY You'd rather he had the crush on you?
JANE Gross, no!
JANE But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she is.
JANE (CONT'D) I know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong.
JANE (CONT'D) He's doing massive psychological damage to me.
RICKY How?
Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face.
JANE Well, now, I too need structure.
JANE A little fucking discipline.
They LAUGH.
She lays back on the bed.
JANE (CONT'D) I'm serious, though.
JANE (CONT'D) How could he not be damaging me?
JANE (CONT'D) I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school.
JANE (CONT'D) What a lame-o.
JANE (CONT'D) Somebody really should put him out of his misery.
Her mind wanders for a beat.
RICKY Want me to kill him for you?
Jane looks at him and sits up.
JANE Yeah, would you?
RICKY It'll cost you.
JANE Well, I've been baby-sitting since I was about ten.
JANE I've got almost three thousand dollars.
JANE 'Course, I was saving it up for a boob job.
She stands and sticks out her breasts, then falls back on the bed, LAUGHING.
JANE (CONT'D) But my tits can wait, huh?
RICKY You know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring somebody to kill your dad.
JANE Well, I guess I'm just not a very nice girl, then, am I?
She smiles dreamily at him.
He turns the Digicam off and the TV screen goes BLUE.
He lowers the camera and looks at her intently.
JANE (CONT'D) You know I'm not serious, right?
RICKY Of course.
He puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed.
A long moment where neither of them speaks.
He caresses her hair, gazing into her eyes.
RICKY (CONT'D) Do you know how lucky we are to have found each other?
We're FLYING above Robin Hood Trail.
We see the BURNHAM'S HOUSE below us as we APPROACH it steadily.
LESTER Remember those posters that said, "Today is the first day of the rest of your life?" Well, that's true of every day except one.
LESTER The day you die.
We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester, wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front door and dashes up the driveway.
We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us.
He carries a WALKMAN and wears EARPHONES, and we HEAR ROCK MUSIC as he runs.
The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins, reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body.
The blender GRINDS as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes himself a high-protein shake.
He's in excellent shape; even his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an athlete.
Jane watches him blankly from the kitchen table.
Carolyn enters.
Lester leans against the counter, drinking his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her.
He's got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable, and he knows it.
Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup, avoiding his eyes, and starts out.
CAROLYN Jane, hurry up.
CAROLYN I've got a very important appointment--
JANE Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight?
Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts.
He doesn't.
CAROLYN Well, of course, she's always welcome.
CAROLYN You know, I thought maybe you two had a fight.
CAROLYN I haven't seen her around here in a while.
And she's gone.
Jane continues staring at her father.
Finally, he glances over at her.
LESTER What?
JANE I've been too embarrassed to bring her over.
JANE Because of you, and the way that you behave.
LESTER What are you talking about?
LESTER I've barely even spoken to her.
JANE Dad!
JANE You stare at her all the time, like you're drunk!
JANE It's disgusting!
LESTER You better watch yourself, Janie, or you're going to turn into a real bitch, just like your mother.
Jane is stunned.
She quickly rises, trying to get out of the kitchen before she starts crying.
ANGLE on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes.
LESTER (CONT'D) Fuck.
We're outside Ricky's room, MOVING slowly toward the open door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau mirror, combing his hair.
The scars on his face are almost gone now.
A REVERSE ANGLE reveals the Colonel standing outside the door looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness.
Then Ricky looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious.
COLONEL You ready to go?
RICKY Oh, I don't need a ride.
RICKY I'm going to go in with Jane and her mom.
Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house.
His POV: Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an insincere smile.
Jane leans forward from the passenger seat and glares at us.
As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester emerges from the house in his sweatpants.
LESTER Yo, Ricky.
LESTER How's it going?
RICKY Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.
Ricky pulls his door shut, but not before Lester mouths "call me" and Ricky gives a slight nod in acknowledgment.
CLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.
As the Mercedes backs out of the driveway, Lester glances over at him.
Lester's POV: The Colonel watches the car driving off, then looks at us.
His face tightens.
LESTER studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes before going inside the house.
CLOSE on the Colonel, deeply troubled.
The door swings open silently and the Colonel enters.
He starts going through Ricky's bureau.
He opens the DRAWER in which we know Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't discover its false bottom.
He stands and looks around, his eyes finally landing on:
The DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf.
The camera is still connected to the TV.
The Colonel turns on the TV, examines the Digicam and presses "play."
The TV's blank screen suddenly gives way to...
On VIDEO: Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space.
The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient.
He takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another.
On the TV screen we see...
On VIDEO: Through the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW, we see Lester step out of his pants and briefs.
Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window as he does...
The Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized.
Lester, wearing a Mr. Smiley's uniform, is happily flipping burgers on a grill.
CO-WORKER Hey Lester, I need that Super Smiley with cheese, A.S.A.P.
LESTER You need more than that, my little hombre.
Lester looks up suddenly when he HEARS:
CAROLYN What's good here?
BUDDY (O.C.) Nothing.
CAROLYN (O.C.) Then I guess we'll just have to be bad, won't we?
CAROLYN (O.C.) I think I'll have a double Smiley Sandwich and curly fries, and a vanilla shake.
BUDDY (O.C.) Make that two.
COUNTER GIRL (O.C.) Please drive around thank you.
Lester's face darkens, then...
he smiles.
He puts his spatula down.
The Mercedes pulls around to the DRIVE-THRU WINDOW.
Carolyn drives; Buddy sits beside her.
CAROLYN I think we deserve a little junk food, after the workout we had this morning.
BUDDY I'm flattered.
They are too involved with each other to notice Lester watching them from the drive-thru window.
LESTER Smile!
LESTER You're at Mr. Smiley's!
Carolyn almost jumps out of her skin.
Lester leans out of the drive-thru window, grinning at her, holding bags filled with fast food.
The Counter Girl stands next to him, staring blankly.
LESTER (CONT'D) Would you like to try our new beef and cheese pot pie on a stick, just a dollar ninety-nine for a limited time only?
Carolyn struggles to appear nonchalant.
CAROLYN We were just at a seminar.
CAROLYN Buddy, this is my--
LESTER Her husband.
LESTER We've met before, but something tells me you're going to remember me this time.
COUNTER GIRL Whoa.
COUNTER GIRL You are so busted.
CAROLYN You know, this really doesn't concern you.
LESTER Actually, Janeane is senior drive-thru manager, so you kind of are on her turf.
LESTER So.
LESTER This makes sense.
CAROLYN Oh, Lester--
LESTER Honey, it's okay.
LESTER I want you to be happy.
LESTER Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?
CAROLYN Lester, just stop it!
LESTER Uh-uh.
LESTER You don't get to tell me what to do.
LESTER Ever again.
Carolyn closes her eyes, defeated, then grabs the wheel, shifts gears and drives off.
The sky is filled with ominous gray clouds.
Wind whips garbage across the parking lot as Carolyn's Mercedes pulls in next to Buddy's Jaguar.
Carolyn grips the wheel tightly, staring straight ahead.
Buddy looks at her unhappily.
BUDDY I'm sorry.
BUDDY I guess we should cool it for a while.
BUDDY I'm facing a potentially very expensive divorce.
CAROLYN Oh, no.
CAROLYN I understand completely.
CAROLYN In order to be successful, one must project an image of success.
CAROLYN At all times.
She regrets it the second it's out of her mouth, and turns to him.
He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and shuts the door.
She starts to CRY.
As before, she SLAPS herself, hard.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Stop it.
CAROLYN (CONT'D) Stop it!
She closes her eyes tight, trying to stop the tears, then suddenly SCREAMS as loud as she can.
Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving the Mercedes alone in the parking lot.
We can still HEAR Carolyn's muffled SCREAMING.
There is a sound of distant THUNDER.
It's RAINING outside.
We HEAR ROCK MUSIC as Lester pumps iron.
He puts the weights down and looks at his REFLECTION in the window:
His POV: His arms are pumped.
He smiles.
He reaches under the bench and grabs a CIGAR BOX.
Opening it, he digs through MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA, only to pull out an empty ZIP-LOC BAG.
LESTER Shit.
Ricky and the Colonel sit at the table, eating in silence.
Barbara rinses off a pan at the sink, then stares at it as if she can't quite remember what she meant to do with it.
We suddenly HEAR a BEEPING noise.
Ricky pulls his BEEPER off his belt and checks it.
RICKY I have to run next door.
RICKY Jane left her geometry book in my bag and she needs it to do her homework.
He heads into the hall.
The Colonel watches him go, uneasy.
Angela drives, squinting through the windshield as the wipers move back and forth.
ANGELA So you and psycho boy are fucking on like, a regular basis now, right?
JANE No.
ANGELA Oh, come on.
ANGELA You can tell me.
ANGELA Does he have a big dick?
JANE Look, I'm not gonna talk about his dick with you, okay?
JANE It's not like that.
ANGELA Not like what?
ANGELA Doesn't he have one?
ANGELA Why don't you want to talk about it?
ANGELA I mean, I tell you every single detail about every guy that I fuck.
JANE Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't, all right?
JANE Maybe I don't really want to hear all that.
ANGELA Oh, so now that you have a boyfriend, you're like, above it?
ANGELA We gotta get you a real man.
The Colonel rinses off his plate at the sink.
Something outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a better look at...
His POV: Through the window over the sink, we can see into the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW.
Our view is blurred by the RAIN, but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of BILLS...
and then Ricky walks into view.
The Colonel's face tightens.
His POV: Lester drapes his arm around Ricky as he gives him the money.
We can only see Lester from the waist up, so he looks naked.
Ricky, his hair wet from the rain, puts the cash in his pocket.
Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder.
RICKY You got any papers?
LESTER Yeah, in the cigar box, right over there.
LESTER You know, put up a fight, dude!
LESTER You are such a pushover.
LESTER "No I can't.
LESTER Really.
LESTER Okay."
And he slaps Ricky playfully on the chest.
Ricky grins, then squats down and reaches under the weight bench.
RICKY You should learn to roll a joint.
Lester sits in the bowl chair and leans back, his hands behind his head, watching Ricky roll the joint.
The Colonel's POV: Lester leans back in his chair.
We see only Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint.
After a beat, Lester's jaw drops, then he throws his head back.
From our perspective, it looks very much like Ricky is giving Lester a blow job.
The Colonel watches, incredulous.
Then we HEAR a CAR APPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at:
His POV: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping behind Lester's Firebird.
As Angela and Jane get out and run toward the house, our focus MOVES back to the GARAGE WINDOW.
Ricky stands, looking a little panicked.
Lester pulls on his T-shirt, and both he and Ricky cross out of view.
Lester leans nonchalantly against the counter.
Jane and Angela enter.
Jane frowns when she sees him.
LESTER Oh.
LESTER Hi.
JANE Where's Mom?
LESTER Don't know.
ANGELA Hi, Mr. Burnham.
LESTER Hi.
He's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job.
ANGELA Wow.
ANGELA Look at you.
ANGELA Have you been working out?
LESTER Some.
Jane rolls her eyes and exits.
Angela walks over to Lester.
ANGELA You can really tell.
ANGELA Look at those arms.
She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so.
But something has changed, and he isn't intimidated at all.
He looks directly back at her, leans in and smiles slowly.
LESTER You like muscles?
His voice is low and intense.
She moves away, suddenly insecure.
ANGELA I--I should probably go see what Jane's up to.
And she heads out quickly.
Lester watches her go, baffled.
Ricky enters, wet from the pouring rain, and crosses to his bureau, pulling the wad of CASH out of his pocket as he goes.
COLONEL (O.C.) Where'd you get that?
Ricky turns, startled.
His POV: The Colonel steps out of the shadows.
Ricky takes a step back.
RICKY From my job.
COLONEL Don't lie to me.
COLONEL I saw you with him.
RICKY You were watching me?
COLONEL What did he make you do?
RICKY Dad, you don't really think...
RICKY me and Mr.
RICKY Burnham?
COLONEL Don't you laugh at me!
COLONEL (CONT'D) I will not sit back and watch my only son become a cocksucker!
RICKY Jesus, what is with you--
The Colonel BACKHANDS Ricky so hard it sends the boy sprawling.
COLONEL I swear to God, I will throw you out of this house and never look at you again.
RICKY You mean that?
COLONEL Damn straight I do.
COLONEL I'd rather you were dead than be a fucking faggot.
A beat.
Ricky suddenly smiles.
He gets up.
RICKY You're right.
RICKY I suck dick for money.
COLONEL Boy--
RICKY Two thousand dollars.
RICKY I'm that good.
COLONEL Get out.
RICKY And you should see me fuck.
RICKY I'm the best piece of ass in three states.
COLONEL Get out!!
COLONEL I don't ever want to see you again!!
Ricky eyes the Colonel.
He's finally discovered a way to break free from his father, and he can't believe it was this simple.
RICKY What a sad old man you are.
COLONEL Get out.
Ricky grabs his backpack, turns and walks out the door, leaving the Colonel standing there, glassy-eyed and breathing heavily.
Ricky enters to discover Barbara standing in the middle of the room, clutching a dish, frightened.
She's obviously heard his argument with his father, and she looks into his eyes, searching, aware that something eventful is taking place.
RICKY Mom, I'm leaving.
A beat.
BARBARA Okay, wear a raincoat.
RICKY I wish things would have been better for you.
RICKY Take care of Dad.
He kisses her cheek softly, then exits out the back door, leaving her standing alone, still clutching her dish.
The Colonel's POV: Below us, Ricky dashes through the rain to the Burnham's front door and knocks.
Lester opens it and lets him in.
The Colonel looks coldly down at us from Ricky's bedroom window, and then he pulls the drapes shut.
The MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 is parked in the breakdown lane, its HAZARD LIGHTS BLINKING.
Cars ZOOM past in the rain.
Carolyn sits behind the wheel, listening to a MOTIVATIONAL TAPE on the STEREO.
TAPE VOICE --disinvesting problems of their power, and removing their ability to make us afraid.
TAPE VOICE This is the secret to "me- centered" living.
TAPE VOICE (CONT'D) Only by taking full responsibility for your problems--and their solutions--will you ever be able to break free from the constant cycle of victimhood.
Carolyn leans over and open the glove compartment.
She takes out her GLOCK 19.
TAPE VOICE (CONT'D) Remember, you are only a victim if you choose to be a victim...
Angela is sprawled across the bed.
Jane stands across the room from her.
JANE I don't think we could be friends anymore.
ANGELA You are way too uptight about sex.
JANE Just don't fuck my dad, all right?
JANE Please?
ANGELA Why not?
There is a KNOCK on the door.
Jane sits up, alarmed.
JANE Dad!
JANE Leave us alone!
RICKY (O.C.) It's me.
Jane jumps up and opens the door and lets him in.
RICKY (CONT'D) If I had to leave tonight, would you come with me?
JANE What?
RICKY If I had to go to New York.
RICKY To live.
RICKY Tonight.
RICKY Would you come with me?
Yes.
You guys can't be serious.
You're just a kid.
And he's like, a mental case.
You'll end up living in a box on the street.
I'm no more a kid than you are!
We can use my plastic surgery money.
We won't have to.
I have over forty thousand dollars.
And I know people in the city who can help us get set up.
What, other drug dealers?
Yes.
Jane, you'd be out of your mind to go with him.
Why do you even care?
Because you're my friend!
She's not your friend.
She's somebody you use to feel better about yourself.
Go fuck yourself, psycho!
You shut up, bitch!
Jane!
He is a freak!
JANE Well, then so am I!
JANE And we'll always be freaks and we'll never be like other people.
JANE And you'll never be a freak because you're just too perfect.
ANGELA Oh, yeah?
ANGELA Well, at least I'm not ugly.
RICKY Yes, you are.
RICKY And you're boring.
RICKY And you're totally ordinary.
RICKY And you know it.
Angela stares at him, stunned, then starts toward the door.
ANGELA You two deserve each other.
And she exits, SLAMMING the door behind her.
Jane turns to Ricky and he takes her in his arms.
Angela sits on the stairs, shaken, crying.
We're MOVING SLOWLY toward the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW through the RAIN.
Through the window, we see Lester, wearing only his sweatpants, performing bench presses.
Through the window, we see the Colonel standing outside, watching.
We ZOOM slowly in on him as he watches, transfixed.
His POV: Lester finishes his last rep, then racks the weights and sits up, sweaty and out of breath.
He runs his free hand over his chest...
and then he glances at us, suddenly aware he's being watched.
Lester and the Colonel stare at each other through the window.
The RAIN is coming down in sheets now, and there is a sharp CLAP of THUNDER.
We're directly outside the GARAGE DOOR as it slowly lifts to reveal Lester smiling at us.
LESTER Jesus, man.
LESTER You're soaked.
Lester pulls the Colonel inside.
The Colonel moves stiffly and seems preoccupied, slightly disoriented.
LESTER You want me to get Ricky?
LESTER He's in Jane's room.
The Colonel just stands there, looking at Lester.
LESTER (CONT'D) You okay?
COLONEL Where's your wife?
LESTER Uh...
LESTER I don't know.
LESTER Probably out fucking that dorky prince of real estate asshole.
LESTER And you know what?
LESTER I don't care.
The Colonel moves closer towards him.
COLONEL Your wife is with another man and you don't care?
LESTER Nope, our marriage is just for show.
LESTER A commercial, for how normal we are.
LESTER When we are anything but.
He grins...
and so does the Colonel.
LESTER (CONT'D) You're shaking.
He places his hand on the Colonel's shoulder.
The Colonel closes his eyes.
LESTER (CONT'D) We really should get you out of these clothes.
COLONEL Yes...
He opens his eyes and looks at Lester, his face filled with an anguished vulnerability we wouldn't have thought possible from him.
His eyes are brimming with tears.
Lester leans in, concerned.
LESTER It's okay.
LESTER Just tell me what you need.
The Colonel reaches up and places his hand on Lester's cheek...
and then kisses him.
Lester is momentarily stunned, and then he pushes the Colonel away.
The Colonel's face crumples in shame.
LESTER (CONT'D) Whoa, whoa, whoa.
LESTER (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
LESTER (CONT'D) You got the wrong idea.
The Colonel stares at the floor, blinking, and then he turns and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night.
Carolyn is still listening to the same MOTIVATIONAL TAPE.
She holds the GLOCK in her hand.
TAPE VOICE "I refuse to be a victim."
TAPE VOICE When this becomes your mantra, constantly running through your head--
Carolyn switches the TAPE OFF and puts the gun in her purse.
CAROLYN I refuse to be a victim.
The Mercedes pulls away from the shoulder.
Lester enters, opens the refrigerator and grabs a BEER.
Suddenly we HEAR MUSIC coming from the other room.
Lester opens his beer and starts toward the family room.
His POV: AS we MOVE SLOWLY around a corner, Angela comes into view, standing at the STEREO, holding a CD case.
She's been crying; her face is puffy, and her hair mussed.
She regards us apprehensively...
then puts on a slightly defiant smile.
ANGELA I hope you don't mind if I play the stereo.
Lester leans against the wall and takes a swig of his beer.
LESTER Not at all.
LESTER Bad night?
ANGELA Not really bad, just...
ANGELA strange.
LESTER Believe me.
LESTER It couldn't possibly be any stranger than mine.
She smiles.
They stand there in silence; the atmosphere is charged.
ANGELA Jane and I had a fight.
ANGELA It was about you.
She's trying to be seductive as she says this, but she's pretty bad at it.
Lester raises his eyebrows.
ANGELA (CONT'D) She's mad at me because I said I think you're sexy.
Lester grins.
He is sexy.
LESTER Do you want a sip?
She nods.
Lester holds the bottle up to her mouth and she drinks clumsily.
He gently wipes her chin with the back of his hand.
LESTER (CONT'D) So...
LESTER (CONT'D) are you going to tell me?
LESTER (CONT'D) What you want?
ANGELA I don't know.
LESTER You don't know?
His face is very close to hers.
She's unnerved--this is happening too fast...
ANGELA What do you want?
LESTER Are you kidding?
LESTER I want you.
LESTER I've wanted you since the first moment I saw you.
LESTER You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
Angela takes a deep breath just before Lester leans in to kiss her cheek, her forehead, her eyelids, her neck...
ANGELA You don't think I'm ordinary?
LESTER You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.
ANGELA Thank you.
ANGELA I don't think there's anything worse than being ordinary...
And Lester kisses her on the lips.
Carolyn drives, her face resolute.
CAROLYN I refuse to be a victim.
CAROLYN I refuse to be a victim.
CAROLYN I refuse to be a victim...
CAROLYN Lester, I have something I have to say to you...
Angela lays back on the couch as Lester moves in over her.
He pulls her jeans off and gently brushes his fingers over her legs, then moves up and caresses her face...
Ricky and Jane, fully clothed, lie curled up on Jane's bed.
JANE Are you scared?
RICKY I don't get scared.
JANE My parents will try to find me.
RICKY Mine won't.
Lester starts unbuttoning Angela's blouse.
She seems disconnected from what's happening.
Lester pulls her blouse open, exposing her breasts.
Lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and then...
ANGELA This is my first time.
Lester LAUGHS.
LESTER You're kidding.
ANGELA I'm sorry.
A beat.
Lester looks down at her, his grin fading.
His POV: Angela lies beneath us, embarrassed and vulnerable.
This is not the mythically carnal creature of Lester's fantasies; this is a nervous child.
ANGELA (CONT'D) I still want to do it...
ANGELA (CONT'D) I just thought I should tell you...
ANGELA (CONT'D) in case you wondered why I wasn't...
ANGELA (CONT'D) better.
Lester's face falls.
There's no way he's going to go through with this now.
ANGELA (CONT'D) What's wrong?
ANGELA (CONT'D) I thought you said I was beautiful.
LESTER You are beautiful.
He grabs a blanket from the back of the couch and drapes it around her shoulders, covering her nakedness.
LESTER (CONT'D) You are so beautiful...
LESTER (CONT'D) and I would be a very lucky man...
He smiles and shakes his head.
Humiliated, Angela starts to cry.
ANGELA I feel so stupid.
LESTER Don't.
He hugs her, letting her put her head on his shoulder, stroking her hair and rocking her gently.
ANGELA I'm sorry.
Lester takes her by the shoulders and looks at her, serious.
LESTER You have nothing to be sorry about.
But she keeps crying.
Lester hugs her again.
We HEAR a loud CLAP of THUNDER outside.
LESTER (CONT'D) It's okay.
LESTER (CONT'D) Everything's okay.
The Mercedes pulls onto Robin Hood Trail.
CLOSE on Carolyn's eyes, reflected in the REAR-VIEW MIRROR.
She turns her head to look out the window:
Her POV: The RED DOOR of the Burnham house stands out, even in the pouring rain.
Angela, once again fully clothed, sits at the kitchen counter.
She's eating a turkey sandwich.
ANGELA Wow.
ANGELA I was starving.
Lester puts a jar of mayonnaise back in the refrigerator.
LESTER Do you want me to make you another one?
ANGELA No, no, no.
ANGELA I'm fine.
He turns to her and cocks an eyebrow.
LESTER You sure?
ANGELA I mean, I'm still a little weirded out, but...
ANGELA ...I feel better.
ANGELA Thanks.
A long beat, as Lester studies her, then:
LESTER How's Jane?
ANGELA What do you mean?
LESTER I mean, how's her life?
LESTER Is she happy?
LESTER Is she miserable?
LESTER I'd really like to know, and she'd die before she'd ever tell me about it.
Angela shifts uncomfortably.
ANGELA She's...
ANGELA she's really happy.
ANGELA She thinks she's in love.
Angela rolls her eyes at how silly this notion is.
LESTER Good for her.
An awkward beat.
ANGELA How are you?
LESTER God, it's been a long time since anybody asked me that.
LESTER I'm great.
They just sit there, smiling at each other, then:
ANGELA I've gotta go to the bathroom.
She crosses off.
Lester watches her go, then stands there wondering why he should suddenly feel so content.
LESTER I'm great.
Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he reaches for...
CLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several years ago at an amusement park.
It's startling how happy they look.
Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and studies the photo.
He suddenly seems older, more mature...
and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago...
LESTER (CONT'D) Man oh man...
LESTER (CONT'D) Man oh man oh man...
After a beat, the barrel of a GUN rises up behind his head, aimed at the base of his skull.
ANGLE ON an arrangement of fresh-cut ROSES in a vase on the opposite counter, deep crimson against the WHITE TILE WALL.
Then a GUNSHOT suddenly rings out, ECHOING unnaturally.
Instantly, the tile is sprayed with BLOOD, the same deep crimson as the roses.
Ricky comes down the stairs, followed by Jane.
Ricky opens the door from the dining room, then stops.
Jane appears behind him.
JANE Oh God.
Their POV: A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table.
Ricky comes into the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid.
Jane follows him, in shock.
Ricky kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face...
then he smiles, ever so slightly.
His POV: Lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but he's smiling the same slight smile.
RICKY Wow.
LESTER (V.O.) I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die.
We're FLYING across a white blanket of clouds.
LESTER (V.O.) First of all, that one second isn't a second at all, it stretches on forever, like an ocean of time...
In BLACK & WHITE: Eleven-year-old Lester looks up, pointing excitedly at:
His POV: A DOT OF LIGHT falls across an unbelievably starry sky.
LESTER (V.O.) For me, it was lying on my back at Boy Scout camp, watching falling stars...
Ricky and Jane lie curled up on Jane's bed, fully clothed.
We HEAR a GUNSHOT from downstairs.
They look at each other, alarmed.
In BLACK & WHITE: Maple trees in autumn.
Ghostly LEAVES FLUTTER slowly toward pavement.
LESTER (V.O.) And yellow leaves, from the maple trees, that lined my street...
Angela stands in front of the mirror, fixing her make-up.
We HEAR the GUNSHOT again.
Angela turns, frightened.
In BLACK & WHITE: CLOSE on an ancient woman's papery HANDS as they button a cardigan sweater.
LESTER (V.O.) Or my grandmother's hands, and the way her skin seemed like paper...
Carolyn walks slowly toward the RED DOOR, drenched to the bone, clutching her PURSE tightly.
We HEAR the GUNSHOT again.
In BLACK & WHITE: A 1970 PONTIAC FIREBIRD in the driveway of a suburban home.
The SUN'S REFLECTION in the windshield
LESTER (V.O.) And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's brand new Firebird...
The Colonel enters, wet.
He's wearing LATEX GLOVES.
BLOOD covers the front of his T-shirt.
He paces in front of one of his GUN CASES; the GLASS DOOR is open, and a gun is conspicuously missing from inside.
In BLACK & WHITE: Jane opens her bedroom door, staring at us.
LESTER (V.O.) And Janie...
In BLACK & WHITE: A door opens to reveal 4-YEAR-OLD JANE, dressed for Halloween in a Princess costume, holding a lit SPARKLER aloft and smiling shyly at us.
LESTER (V.O.) And Janie...
Carolyn enters, terrified, still clutching her PURSE.
She shuts the door and locks it, then takes the GLOCK 19 out of her purse.
She opens the closet door and shoves the gun into a HAMPER.
Then, suddenly aware of Lester's scent, she grabs as many of his clothes as she can and pulls them to her, burying her face in them.
She sinks to her knees, pulling several items of clothing down with her, and she begins to cry.
A younger Carolyn sits across from us in one of those SPINNING-TEACUP RIDES, LAUGHING uncontrollably as she twists the wheel in front of her, making us SPIN even faster.
LESTER (V.O.) And...
LESTER (V.O.) Carolyn.
On VIDEO: We're watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier, of the empty white PLASTIC BAG being blown about.
The wind carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...
LESTER (V.O.) I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me...
LESTER (V.O.) but it's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world.
LESTER (V.O.) Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst...
We're FLYING once again over Robin Hood Trail, ASCENDING
LESTER (V.O.) ...and then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life...
LESTER (V.O.) You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure.
LESTER (V.O.) But don't worry...
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) You will someday.
