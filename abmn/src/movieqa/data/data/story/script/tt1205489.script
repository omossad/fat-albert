GRAN TORINO

Nick Schenk
INT. CHURCH We're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski.
INT. CHURCH In attendance are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored teenagers.
INT. CHURCH WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church.
INT. CHURCH He speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit.
OLDER MAN I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt.
OLDER MAN She was a real peach.
WALT Thanks for coming, Al.
WALT Walt Kowalski looks young for his age.
WALT He has slate blue eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.
WALT Walt is also a perfectionist.
WALT Nothing escapes his hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge.
WALT Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at his wife's funeral.
WALT His eyes narrow at his GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.
WALT Jesus Christ.
WALT Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from across the pews.
MITCH Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.
MITCH He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral?
STEVE What do you expect?
STEVE Dad's still living in the ?50s.
STEVE He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
MITCH Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey.
MITCH I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
STEVE My point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man.
PAGE 3 It's inevitable.
PAGE 3 That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings; the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath, it's always something.
MITCH What are we going to do with him?
MITCH Don't you think he'll get in trouble by himself over in the old neighborhood?
STEVE Why don't you have him move in with you?
MITCH Ha ha.
INT. CHURCH - LATER The choir sings the Beatitudes.
INT. CHURCH - LATER Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish.
INT. CHURCH - LATER FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife.
INT. CHURCH - LATER Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak, unconvincing words of Father Janovich.
FATHER JANOVICH Death...
FATHER JANOVICH is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics.
FATHER JANOVICH Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased ...
FATHER JANOVICH and their families.
FATHER JANOVICH Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits them.
FATHER JANOVICH And some may ask, what is death.
FATHER JANOVICH Is it the end?
FATHER JANOVICH Or is it the beginning?
FATHER JANOVICH And what is life?
FATHER JANOVICH What is this thing we call life?
WALT Jesus.
WALT Walt coughs.
WALT He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips.
WALT He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white cloth.
INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME The house is crammed with people following the service.
INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Walt doesn't know what to do with himself.
INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME He has to keep busy.
INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Steve steps over to his father.
STEVE A lot of people showed up after the service.
WALT Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew there'd be plenty of ham.
WALT I think I'll go downstairs and get some more chairs.
STEVE I'll do it, Dad.
WALT Naw, we need them now, not next week.
INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME Grandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in the cellar.
INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME A box of old Korea War photos are pawed through.
INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are sprawled dead on the ground.
DAVID Is that Dad?
DANIEL No, it's Grandpa Walt.
DANIEL Josh turns the photo over and reads it...
JOSH ?Third Platoon, E company, March second, 1952, Korea.'
DANIEL Where's Korea?
JOSH Hell if I know?
JOSH David holds up a MEDAL.
DAVID Cool, I found a medal.
DAVID They hear someone coming downstairs.
DAVID By the time Walt descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch, pretending to be doing nothing.
DAVID Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.
DAVID People eat and chat.
DAVID Ashley marches over to her parents, KAREN and Mitch.
ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER) How long do we have to stay, this ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I'm bored.
ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER) Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs, he overheard his Granddaughter.
ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER) Mitch and Karen are embarrassed.
MITCH Ashley, honey.
MITCH Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
ASHLEY Me?
KAREN Yes you.
ASHLEY Grandpa Walt, can I help you with the chairs.
WALT I'll take care of it, you just painted your nails.
WALT Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window.
WALT It's snowing.
WALT Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks relieved to get out of the house.
WALT I'd better salt the sidewalk before someone falls and breaks a hip.
WALT Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his very, very, very old DOG follows him outside.
WALT Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk.
WALT He deliberately stops at the boundary of his property.
WALT The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged to Polish families.
WALT Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on.
WALT Walt can see through the window that the living room is jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong.
WALT And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full- blown, unrepentant racist.
WALT Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.
WALT Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can they cram into a living room?
WALT Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.
WALT Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a cigarette.
WALT She has pulled back the canvas tarp that covers his pride and joy, his beloved 1972 GRAN TORINO.
WALT The Gran Torino is in mint condition.
WALT It has been babied since the day it rolled off the line.
WALT Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt.
ASHLEY Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car?
ASHLEY Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still burning cigarette before answering.
ASHLEY I never knew you had a cool old car.
WALT It's only been in here since before you were born.
ASHLEY So, what are you like going to do with it like, when...
ASHLEY you die?
ASHLEY Walt lights up a smoke --
WALT Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
WALT Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino.
ASHLEY Then what about that super cool retro couch in the den, I'm going to State next year and I don't have, like, any furniture?
ASHLEY Walt walks out without commenting.
ASHLEY The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door.
ASHLEY Standing there is TAO, a sixteen-year-old HMONG boy.
ASHLEY Walt scowls.
ASHLEY TAO is slight, he has long hair, long lashes, but is very good-looking -- like an Asian Johnny Depp.
WALT Who the hell are you?
TAO I'm Tao, I live next door.
WALT What?!
WALT Speak up, boy, get the shit out of your mouth.
WALT What do you want?
TAO Do you have jumper cables?
TAO My uncle's car is old and...
WALT No.
WALT And have some goddamned respect, zipper head, we're mourning over here.
WALT Walt slams the door in Tao's face.
WALT Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich.
WALT Walt hates situations like this.
FATHER JANOVICH How you holding up, Walt?
WALT Mr. Kowalski.
FATHER JANOVICH Huh?
WALT It's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH Right, Mr. Kowalski.
FATHER JANOVICH Your wife and I became quite close these last few months.
FATHER JANOVICH She asked that I watch over you when she passed on.
FATHER JANOVICH I told her I watch out for my entire flock, but she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.
WALT I appreciate your kindness to my wife and now that you've spoken your piece, why don't you move on to the next sheep?
WALT Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.
FATHER JANOVICH Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her wish for you to go to confession.
FATHER JANOVICH She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
WALT Is that so?
FATHER JANOVICH It is.
FATHER JANOVICH Walt drains his lowball glass.
WALT Well, I confess I never much liked church and only went because of the wife.
WALT And I confess I have no desire to confess to a boy who is fresh out of the seminary.
WALT People are leaving Walt's house.
WALT A mass of shuffling, stiff-jointed old Pollacks.
WALT Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are more Hmong going up the sidewalk.
WALT They laugh and chatter and carry big dishes of food and fruit.
WALT They are a happy bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home.
WALT The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony.
WALT A three-day-old baby is named and three souls are located for the newborn.
ANOTHER ANGLE Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old ladies from the funeral.
ANOTHER ANGLE He hooks up the jumper cables to their dead battery.
ANOTHER ANGLE Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a brand new Toyota Land Cruiser.
ANOTHER ANGLE Mitch opens the window.
MITCH I'd really like to help, Dad, but we have to get the kids home, they're getting restless.
MITCH Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance.
WALT Fine.
WALT Go.
MITCH I'll call in a few, see how you're doing.
MITCH Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off.
WALT Kill you to buy American.
MITCH Did you see him look at the truck?
MITCH It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Buggy that.
MITCH Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
KAREN At least he didn't say anything this time.
MITCH He didn't have to.
KAREN Well, what do you expect?
KAREN The man worked at a Ford plant for twenty- eight years.
MITCH And I suppose that's my goddamned fault?
11 Walt gets his guests' engine running.
11 As they drive off, Walt hears faint SINGING.
11 Walt looks into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes.
11 The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their heads sliced off, right there in the yard.
11 The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder.
11 It's a sacrifice.
11 Walt spits in the snow and says to Daisy.
WALT Barbarians.
WALT Goddamned barbarians.
12 The house is a buzz of activity.
12 The older Hmong speak their native language, the younger generation speaks both English and Hmong.
12 Tao's Grandmother (PHONG) complains to a MAN.
PHONG There's no man in this house, that's why my daughter should remarry.
PHONG Being a second wife is better than having a woman be the head of the household.
PHONG It's not our way.
MAN What about Tao?
PHONG What about him?
MAN He's the man in the house.
PHONG Tao's not a man.
PHONG Look at him in the kitchen, washing dishes like a woman.
PHONG Even his sister gives him orders and he obeys.
PHONG The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of dishes.
PHONG An older relative drops dishes in the sink, without acknowledging Tao's presence.
PHONG It's clearly an insult.
PHONG In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong ?Soul Calling? ceremony starts its next phase.
PHONG An elder, the family SHAMAN, is present and begins the ritual.
PHONG As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch.
PHONG Tao slips on his coat and goes out the back door.
13 Tao wobbles as he pedals his bike through the snow.
13 Tao passes Walt's garage and is startled as Walt appears from a shadow, JUMPER CABLES in his hands.
13 They make eye contact as Tao passes.
13 Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy.
WALT I thought these zips were supposed to be such hard workers.
WALT Christ, I had my own car when I was his age.
14 Tao exits the store, gets on his bike and rides off.
PAGE 12 A few blocks away, Tao rides past a snowbank when -- WHAM!
PAGE 12 A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his front wheel.
PAGE 12 Tao flies over the handlebars into the snow.
PAGE 12 A chorus of laughter is heard.
PAGE 12 Three LATINOS stand around the stunned, prone Tao.
HEAD LATINO Whatta you gonna do, gook?
HEAD LATINO You gonna ?Kung Fu' us?
HEAD LATINO Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike.
LATINO #2 Surprised it ain't a girl's bike.
LATINO #2 The Latinos laugh.
LATINO #2 Tao remains on the ground.
HEAD LATINO You gonna get up or what?
HEAD LATINO Tao doesn't move.
HEAD LATINO Tell you what, I'll let you take the first swing.
HEAD LATINO You drop me and you can have your bike back.
HEAD LATINO Tao smiles, he can't help it.
HEAD LATINO What the fuck you smiling at, gook?
HEAD LATINO Something funny?
HEAD LATINO He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet.
HEAD LATINO You better get the fuck outta here, bitch.
HEAD LATINO He pushes Tao backwards.
HEAD LATINO Tao falls back into the snow.
HEAD LATINO This time Tao crab-walks back away from the Latinos.
HEAD LATINO The Latinos stroll away with Tao's bike.
SUPERIMPOSE THREE MONTHS LATER Walt is going about the chores of spring cleaning.
PAGE 13 Walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors' houses.
PAGE 13 Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors' houses are rundown.
PAGE 13 Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped screen doors, peeling paint.
PAGE 13 One neighbor has installed a chicken coop.
PAGE 13 Walt looks down at Daisy --
WALT Damn chinks let their yards go to hell.
WALT Polarski would turn over in his grave if he could see what they did to his lawn.
WALT Tao walks past.
WALT Walt watches him pass.
WALT I don't know why these goddamned slopes had to move to my block.
WALT This used to be a nice neighborhood.
16 Tao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking chair.
16 PHONG nods back to Tao, then turns her evil eye back on Walt, whom she's been seething at all morning.
PHONG Why doesn't that stupid, hairy white man move?
PHONG He must be too dumb to realize he's not welcome here.
PHONG All the Mee-Khah left in the neighborhood should just move away.
PHONG Look at him strut like a rooster.
PHONG She sees Walt glance at her and spit.
PHONG Phong glares back and spits beetle juice, which has turned her teeth black.
17 Daisy snoozes next to the front door.
17 The doorbell rings; Daisy doesn't even move.
17 Walt walks to the front door holding a roll of duct tape.
17 The doorbell rings again.
17 Walt looks down at Daisy --
WALT Jesus Christ, dog, have you gone totally deaf?
WALT Walt opens the door.
WALT Standing on his front step is Father Janovich.
FATHER JANOVICH Hi there, Walt.
WALT Listen, son, you're not my barber, you're not a friend, so why in the hell do you think you can call me Walt?
FATHER JANOVICH Sorry...
FATHER JANOVICH Mr. Kowalski.
WALT So, what are you peddling now?
FATHER JANOVICH Oh, nothing.
FATHER JANOVICH Thought I'd drop by and see how you were doing.
FATHER JANOVICH Haven't seen you in church in awhile.
WALT Okay.
WALT You've done your good deed, now why don't you run along.
FATHER JANOVICH I'd really like to talk, Mr.
FATHER JANOVICH Kowalski.
WALT I don't think so, kid.
WALT Sorry.
FATHER JANOVICH Why?
FATHER JANOVICH Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
WALT You don't want to know.
FATHER JANOVICH No, I do.
WALT The problem is I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old women and promises them eternity.
PAGE 15 Walt shuts the front door in Father Janovich's face.
18 Tao walks down the street, his head in a book.
18 He finally realizes there's a blue Chevy following slowly behind him.
18 The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace with his step.
18 Tao looks over to the occupants of the Chevy.
18 It's two LATINOS.
18 Tao quickens his pace, but the Chevy easily keeps up with Tao.
LATINO DRIVER Is you a boy or a girl, I can't tell?
LATINO #2 What you reading, gook, Jackass And The Rice Stalk?
LATINO #2 Tao laughs, but keeps walking.
LATINO DRIVER That's right, you keep walking.
LATINO DRIVER Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man.
LATINO DRIVER Why gooks come up in here and fuck up our neighborhood?
LATINO DRIVER Down the street -- is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC with a big SPOILER on the back.
LATINO DRIVER Inside are five Hmong gangbangers.
LATINO DRIVER The Hmong gangbangers notice Tao being followed by the Latinos.
LATINO DRIVER SPIDER, the driver, squints and then points at Tao.
SPIDER Dude, that's my little cousin, Tao.
SMOKIE You sure about that, Spider?
SPIDER I'm sure.
SPIDER Do we do something...
SPIDER or what?
SPIDER Smokie is the gang leader.
SPIDER He looks at Tao for a second.
SMOKIE Your cousin tight with anyone?
SPIDER No, he flies solo, Smokie.
SMOKIE Okay.
SMOKIE Let's go help out our little cousin.
SMOKIE Smokie nods to Spider, they roar up and stop right across from Tao and the Latinos' car.
SMOKIE You better not be giving my bro here a hard time or you're gonna wish you never been born.
LATINO DRIVER Oh goody, more Rice Niggers.
LATINO DRIVER The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL.
LATINO DRIVER A Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays a sub-machine gun.
LATINO DRIVER The Latinos are way out-gunned.
LATINO #2 Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats.
LATINO #2 Go back to your fucking rice paddy.
LATINO #2 The Latinos screech their tires and are gone.
LATINO #2 The Hmongs in the car smile and congratulate themselves.
LATINO #2 Tao simply keeps walking down the street!
SMOKIE Where the fuck does he think he's going?
SMOKIE Turn us around and go after that cousin of yours.
SMOKIE They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with him as he walks.
SPIDER Hey, cuz, slow down, where you going?
SPIDER You should really think about hanging with us, man.
SPIDER If we all stick together, shit like that won't happen, with those Spicks.
SPIDER Tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer.
SPIDER You can't be such a little girl.
SPIDER You join up with us, we'll keep you out of trouble, cuz.
PAGE 17 Tao looks at the sub-machine gun cradled by the Hmong gangbanger in the back seat.
PAGE 17 Smokie takes this all in.
PAGE 17 He looks down the street and sees that in a half block, Tao will have to pass a group of Latino gangbanger types.
SMOKIE You think about it and we'll see you tomorrow.
19 Tao digs in the garden.
19 Tao's younger sister SUE sits and reads JANE magazine on the porch.
19 The tricked-out Honda with Blue Neon lights pulls up.
19 Spider, Smokie and two other Hmong gangbangers get out.
SPIDER Hey, cuz.
SPIDER Hey, Sue.
SUE What do you want?
SPIDER Came to talk to my cousin Tao.
SPIDER Smokie looks over to Sue.
SMOKIE Spider, who's the other cousin?
SMOKIE SUE laughs at the name ?Spider.? Sue is seventeen, has long straight hair with red highlights.
SUE ?Spider'?
SUE Is that what he just called you, Fong?
SPIDER This is my little cousin, Sue.
SPIDER Smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue.
SMOKIE Hey, Sue...
SMOKIE how old are you, girl?
SUE Mentally, I'm way too old for you.
SUE I'm going inside.
SPIDER That's right, go inside while the men talk.
SUE Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing, Fong.
SUE Sue rolls her eyes and goes inside.
SUE Smokie stares at Tao.
SPIDER You think about what we talked about?
SPIDER A PAUSE.
SPIDER Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a cigarette.
SPIDER Tao shakes his head ?no? and looks at the ground.
SMOKIE That's exactly the point, Tao.
SMOKIE Spider told me how everyone thinks you're a pushover, how everybody walks all over you and shit.
SMOKIE I mean, look at you, out here working in the garden like a woman.
SMOKIE Tao nods silently, but still looks at the ground.
SMOKIE It ain't no big thing.
SMOKIE You just need a little guidance.
SMOKIE Tao looks up at Smokie.
SMOKIE Tao looks a little skeptical.
SMOKIE It's true, man.
SMOKIE Shit, I used to be kind of a quiet little punk like you, everybody fucking with me.
SMOKIE But finally I said ?no more.' You, you're lucky, Tao, we got your back.
SMOKIE Me?
SMOKIE I didn't have nobody.
SMOKIE Had to mold my own tribe.
SPIDER Smokie's right.
SPIDER We're family, right?
SPIDER You with us or what?
SMOKIE I swear, brother, we're the best friends you'll ever have.
SMOKIE And anyone fucks with you, they're fucked.
SPIDER Come on, man.
SPIDER Tao clears his throat and speaks for the first time.
TAO What do I have to do?
TAO Smokie points to Walt's open garage.
SMOKIE Spider mentioned that neighbor of yours.
INT. GARAGE ZOOM IN -- There it sits with the tarp rolled back, Walt's gorgeous, shining GRAN TORINO.
SMOKIE Now that's a car.
SPIDER Shit ya.
SPIDER 1972 Gran Torino fastback.
SPIDER Cobra jet engine.
SPIDER Mint.
SPIDER Next to the garage, Walt is bent over planting tomatoes.
SPIDER Walt notices the Hmong punks looking at him.
20 Walt sits at the bar in the VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars) drinking with the old buddies and cracking off- color jokes.
WALT I got one.
WALT A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy walk into a bar, the bartender looks up at them and says -- ?get the fuck out.' The gang laughs, until they see Father Janovich step up to the bar.
WALT He smiles as he recognizes several faces.
FATHER JANOVICH So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church.
MEL Hiya, Father J.
FATHER JANOVICH Hi, Mel.
FATHER JANOVICH Hey there, Darrel.
DARREL Hello, Father.
FATHER JANOVICH Hi, Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH Walt says nothing.
FATHER JANOVICH He just sips his beer.
DARREL What brings you in here, Father?
DARREL The meat raffle?
FATHER JANOVICH No.
FATHER JANOVICH I came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay.
FATHER JANOVICH Mel and Darrel look at Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH It puts him on the spot.
WALT I have to hand it to you, Padre.
WALT You are persistent.
FATHER JANOVICH I promised your wife.
FATHER JANOVICH Walt looks over at Mel and Darrel and then back at Father Janovich.
WALT Oh Jesus Christ, let's grab a booth.
21 The waitress comes over.
WALT I'll have a Pabst and a shot.
WALT What are you having, Father?
FATHER JANOVICH I'll have a Diet Coke.
WALT Bullshit, this is a bar, what do you want to drink?
FATHER JANOVICH Ummmm...
FATHER JANOVICH I'll have a gin and tonic.
WALT Attaboy.
WALT The waitress leaves.
WALT So, what do you want?
FATHER JANOVICH I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
WALT Jesus Christ, why'd you do that?
FATHER JANOVICH She was very insistent.
FATHER JANOVICH She made me.
WALT You sure are fond of promising people stuff you can't deliver on.
FATHER JANOVICH Let's talk about something else.
WALT Like what?
FATHER JANOVICH Life and death.
WALT What would you know about it?
FATHER JANOVICH I'd like to think I know a lot.
FATHER JANOVICH I'm a priest.
WALT You stand at the altar and preach on and on about life and death without knowing anything other than what you learned in priest school.
WALT Everything you say sounds like it's out of the Rookie Preachers Handbook.
FATHER JANOVICH I don't know about that...
PAGE 22 Walt waves his hand and cuts him off.
WALT ?Death is bittersweet?
WALT Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.' That's what you know of life and death?
WALT Good God, it's pathetic.
FATHER JANOVICH What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
WALT Plenty.
WALT I lived with death for three years in Korea.
WALT We shot people, we stabbed them with bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year- old kids to death with shovels, for Christ's sake.
WALT I did things that won't leave me till the day I die, horrible things, things I have to live with.
FATHER JANOVICH And what about life?
FATHER JANOVICH Walt has to think for a second.
FATHER JANOVICH He struggles with his answer.
WALT Well...
WALT I survived the war...
WALT got married...
WALT and raised a family.
FATHER JANOVICH Sounds like you know more about death than you do living.
FATHER JANOVICH Walt downs a shot.
WALT Maybe so.
22 Walt hears a sound and wakes up.
22 He's very groggy, he had plenty to drink at the VFW.
WALT Daisy?
WALT The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner.
WALT Walt looks at the clock; it's 3:48 am.
WALT Walt looks out his bedroom window.
WALT He sees the faint beam of a flashlight in his garage.
WALT Son of a bitch.
WALT Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea.
WALT Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and chambers a round with a loud SNAP.
23 The light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face to face with the barrel of Walt's M1 RIFLE.
23 Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away.
23 Tao drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud metallic clang.
23 Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror.
23 As Tao backs up, Walt advances, step for step.
23 Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip.
23 They both start to fall.
23 The lightbulb is bumped with the rifle barrel and swings back and forth.
23 As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally FIRES THE RIFLE.
23 The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer sign on the wall.
23 Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over Walt.
23 Tao runs out of the garage and into the night.
23 Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned.
23 Sweat runs down his forehead.
23 He coughs up blood.
23 The lightbulb still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage.
WALT Shit.
24 Tao scrambles down the alley.
24 Parked off to the side is Spider's Honda.
24 Spider opens the door.
SPIDER Get in, get in!
SPIDER Tao runs right past him.
SPIDER Spider guns the motor and pulls in front of Tao.
SPIDER Smokie, Spider and another gangbanger get out.
SMOKIE Get in, Tao.
TAO No way.
TAO No fucking way.
TAO Leave me alone!
TAO Smokie, Spider and the other gangbanger grab Tao.
SPIDER I vouched for you, Tao, because you're family and you're with us now.
SPIDER Tao struggles.
TAO He shot at me!
TAO I'm out!
TAO I'm out!!!
TAO Tao squirms out of Smokie's grasp.
TAO Smokie yells at Tao as he runs away...
SMOKIE Don't fool yourself, Tao.
SMOKIE You don't join us and bail.
SMOKIE Dumb motherfucker.
SPIDER Should we go after him?
SMOKIE Naw, he's got nowhere to go.
SMOKIE Let's get out of here.
25 Walt drills heavy-gauge screen mesh over the windows on the garage.
25 The phone rings and Walt answers.
WALT Hello?
MITCH (V.O.) Morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.
WALT It's one in the afternoon.
WALT The CAMERA now INTERCUTS BETWEEN Walt and Mitch in the kitchen of his huge, modern suburban house.
MITCH Right, good afternoon, then.
WALT So, what do you want?
MITCH Me?
MITCH Nothing.
MITCH What would I want?
WALT I don't know.
WALT Your wife already went through all of your mother's jewelry.
MITCH No.
MITCH I was just wondering how you are, what's going on, anything new in the old neighborhood?
MITCH Walt looks at the bullet hole in his Hamm's Beer sign.
WALT Nope.
MITCH Great.
MITCH Smooth sailing then?
WALT Yup.
WALT There's a very painful pause in the conversation.
MITCH Well good...
MITCH Say, Dad?
WALT Uh-huh.
MITCH Do you still know that guy from the plant who has Viking season tickets?
26 Walt has parked the Gran Torino at an angle across his driveway.
26 Walt mutters as he rubs Turtle Wax on his car.
27 Walt fishes out a soft pack of cigarettes and lights one.
27 He exhales as he looks at his car.
PAGE 26 It's stunning.
PAGE 26 It absolutely sparkles.
PAGE 26 The chrome shines, the tires look new and the paint is waxed and polished.
PAGE 26 Walt looks up again and his eyes sweep the neighborhood in defiance.
PAGE 26 A couple of Hmong teenagers look at the car.
WALT That's right, ain't she pretty.
WALT Walt drops down heavily into an old lawn chair and pops open a can of Pabst.
28 Dusk is falling.
28 Walt finally gets up, folds up his lawn chair and walks stiffly back into the garage.
28 Walt flips on the outdoor light, highlighting the Gran Torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway.
28 The whole scene looks like a mid-sixties car ad in Popular Mechanics.
28 Walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen light comes on.
28 The Gran Torino remains in the driveway.
28 It's a challenge, an invitation.
28 Walt is daring the thief to come back.
28 And Walt's ready this time.
29 The tricked-out Honda drives up, but doesn't stop at Walt's.
29 It pulls up in front of Tao's house.
29 Tao and Sue exchange looks out on the front step.
29 Smokie, Spider and two others get out, walking confidently up the sidewalk towards them.
29 They grin, they're cocky.
SPIDER Hey, cuz.
SPIDER What's up?
TAO What are you doing here?
SPIDER Be happy.
SPIDER We've got good news.
SUE Oh really?
SUE What's that?
SMOKIE We're giving you another shot.
TAO I don't think so.
SMOKIE You blew it the first time.
SMOKIE We've got another little inauguration planned for you.
SMOKIE This time there'll be no mistakes.
SUE Another big, tough gangbanger with ?little-man' complex.
SUE Smokie leers at Sue.
SUE It makes her uncomfortable.
SMOKIE I got my eye on you too, little girl.
SUE Whatever.
SMOKIE Come on, Tao.
SMOKIE Let's go.
SMOKIE Tao says nothing.
SMOKIE He looks at the ground.
SPIDER He said, let's go.
SMOKIE Come on, man.
SMOKIE Nobody's gonna get hurt.
SMOKIE We'll take care of you.
SUE Don't go, Tao.
SMOKIE You mind your own business, girl.
SMOKIE Two Hmong gangbangers grab Tao by the arms.
SMOKIE The front door swings open and there stands a glaring Phong.
PHONG Leave my grandson alone!
PAGE 28 I know what you are.
PAGE 28 Go away and don't come back.
SMOKIE That old woman's got bigger balls than you.
SMOKIE You always let little girls and old ladies fight for you?
SMOKIE Tao tries to squirm away.
SMOKIE Smokie grabs him by the hair and opens his coat to reveal the PISTOL in his belt.
SMOKIE I'm not gonna say it again.
SMOKIE Let's go.
SMOKIE Now.
SMOKIE Tao is shoved towards the car.
SMOKIE Suddenly -- Sue jumps on the back of one of the gangbangers and knocks him to the ground.
SMOKIE Tao breaks free.
SUE Run, Tao, run!
SUE Sue is slapped to the ground.
RUN!! Tao is tackled by Smokie and punched in the face.
RUN!! Tao's mother comes out the front door.
RUN!! Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay.
RUN!! A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into the yard.
RUN!! All the gangbangers overreact and pull their pistols.
RUN!! The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel.
RUN!! Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie.
RUN!! It becomes a pushing, rolling, surging melee.
RUN!! This mess boils over and spills into Walt's front yard.
30 The gangbangers, Tao, his mother, grandmother and Sue all struggle on Walt's painstakingly maintained lawn.
30 A ceramic Lawn Gnome is knocked over and breaks.
PAGE 29 And before anyone can blink, WALT has the muzzle of his big 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle pointing at Smokie's face.
WALT Get off my lawn.
SMOKIE Listen, old man, you don't want...
WALT I said get off my lawn.
WALT Now.
WALT Walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers.
WALT The guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big military rifle Walt holds.
SMOKIE Are you fucking crazy?
SMOKIE Go back in your house, old man.
WALT Get off my lawn.
SMOKIE I'm not fucking around, Gramps.
SMOKIE Walt spits out the side of his mouth.
SMOKIE He grins.
WALT Don't think for a second I won't blow a big hole in your face and it won't bother me a bit, not any more than if I shot a deer.
WALT Now get off my goddamned lawn.
WALT Two of the Hmong gangbangers take a step back.
WALT Walt senses their fear.
WALT Only Smokie holds his ground.
WALT Believe me, kid, I'll blow your damn head off, go back to bed and sleep like a baby.
WALT I couldn't care less.
SMOKIE I'm not gonna warn you again!
SMOKIE Walt laughs...
WALT You're nothing to me.
WALT In Korea, we stacked fucks like you five feet high and used you as sandbags.
PAGE 30 Complete silence, there's no sound anywhere in the neighborhood.
PAGE 30 All eyes are on Walt.
PAGE 30 Walt CLICKS OFF the safety on the M1 Garand Rifle.
PAGE 30 Smokie and the gangbangers give Walt fierce looks, but melt back towards their car.
PAGE 30 As they get into the car -- Smokie has to say something.
SMOKIE You better watch yourself, old man.
SMOKIE The Honda screeches its tires and goes off down the street.
SMOKIE Walt looks at Tao, Sue, Mom and Grandma who stand in stunned silence in his front yard.
SMOKIE A PAUSE.
SMOKIE Finally, Sue speaks up...
SUE Thank you.
SUE Walt lowers his rifle and spits on the ground.
WALT I said get off my lawn.
31 We hear a sound outside.
31 Walt grabs his rifle, swings open the front door and leads with the barrel.
32 Walt looks around and slowly lowers his rifle.
32 His front porch is covered with FLOWERS and FRUIT and GIFTS of food.
32 There must be a dozen different gifts piled there.
32 Daisy comes out and stretches on the porch, before putting her nose in a food basket.
WALT Bad dog.
WALT Bad deaf, dumb, blind dog.
33 Walt carries three big bouquets of flowers to the trash.
33 He dumps them on top of other gifts he received from the Hmongs.
33 His garbage is overflowing.
33 Coming down the alley is another Hmong couple, they smile carrying a basket filled with Asian vegetables.
33 Walt holds up his hand like a traffic cop.
WALT No.
WALT No more.
WALT The Hmong couple nod, say something with a smile and turn around.
NEXT DOOR Tao, his mother and Sue argue in the yard.
NEXT DOOR They gesture towards Walt's house.
NEXT DOOR The women buzz around Tao, all speaking in his ear at the same time.
NEXT DOOR Phong yells at them from the porch, but they ignore her.
NEXT DOOR Walt watches as the mother and Sue march Tao towards his house.
NEXT DOOR Tao looks like a whipped dog.
WALT Why won't these people leave me alone?
WALT Walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts up his hands, indicating they've come far enough.
WALT Sue holds up a plant.
SUE We brought you some shallots to plant in your garden.
WALT I don't want them.
SUE They're perennials, they come back every year.
WALT No.
WALT You keep them.
WALT Why do you people keep giving me all this garbage?
WALT Sue is a little taken aback.
SUE Because...
SUE because you saved Tao.
WALT No, I didn't.
WALT All I did was get a bunch of jabbering gooks off my lawn.
SUE Well, you're a hero to the neighborhood.
WALT No, I'm not.
SUE Too bad, they think you are and that's why they're bringing you the gifts.
WALT Just take your plant and leave me alone.
WALT Walt turns and starts to walk away.
WALT Tao's mother speaks rapidly in Hmong to Sue.
WALT They look at Tao and then to Walt.
SUE There's another thing.
WALT What?
SUE This is my mother, Vu, I'm Sue and this is my brother, Tao.
SUE We live next door.
WALT So?
SUE Tao is here to apologize.
SUE Sue shoots a hard look at Tao, who shifts uncomfortably.
TAO I'm sorry.
WALT For what?
TAO For trying to steal your car.
TAO Walt's eyes go wide in recognition.
TAO He turns white with rage.
WALT Get this straight, I see you on my property again, you're done.
WALT Walt turns on his heels and storms into his house.
34 The doorbell rings.
34 Walt opens it to find Father Janovich standing on his front step.
FATHER JANOVICH Good afternoon, Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH Walt's eyes narrow.
FATHER JANOVICH I mean, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT I already told you I'm not going to confession.
FATHER JANOVICH Why didn't you just call the police?
WALT Pardon?
FATHER JANOVICH I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood.
FATHER JANOVICH Why didn't you call the police?
WALT Oh, I prayed for them to show up, but guess what?
WALT No answer.
FATHER JANOVICH What were you thinking?
FATHER JANOVICH Someone could have been killed.
FATHER JANOVICH We're talking life and death here.
WALT Not that it's any of your goddamned business, but when things happen quickly like that, you have to react.
WALT In Korea, we never ?called the police' when a swarm of screaming gooks came pouring into our lines.
WALT We reacted.
FATHER JANOVICH We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
FATHER JANOVICH Walt says nothing.
FATHER JANOVICH I've been thinking about our discussion on life and death.
FATHER JANOVICH About what you said.
FATHER JANOVICH About how you carry around the horrible things you were forced to do.
FATHER JANOVICH Horrible things that won't leave you.
FATHER JANOVICH It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden.
FATHER JANOVICH Things done during war are terrible, being ordered to kill, killing to save others, killing to save yourself.
FATHER JANOVICH You're right, those are things I don't know anything about.
FATHER JANOVICH But I do know about forgiveness.
FATHER JANOVICH And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them.
FATHER JANOVICH Stronger men than you.
FATHER JANOVICH Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace.
FATHER JANOVICH Walt nods.
FATHER JANOVICH Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye.
FATHER JANOVICH Almost.
WALT I'm impressed.
WALT You came with your guns loaded, for once.
FATHER JANOVICH Thank you.
WALT You have balls, Father.
WALT And what you said, you're right.
WALT I'm sure stronger men than me have found their salvation.
WALT Hallelujah.
WALT But there's one thing you're way wrong about.
FATHER JANOVICH What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
WALT The thing that haunts a guy is the stuff he wasn't ordered to do.
35 The old, balding BARBER finishes cutting Walt's hair.
BARBER There, you look like a human being again.
BARBER You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap bastard.
WALT I'm just amazed that you're still alive.
WALT I keep hoping you'll die and they'll get someone good in here, but you just hang in there, you dumb, Italian-Wop-Dago, you.
BARBER That'll be ten dollars, Walt.
WALT Ten dollars?
WALT Jesus Christ, Martin, you keep raising the price.
WALT You sure you're not part Jew?
WALT Martin the Barber laughs at Walt.
BARBER It's been ten bucks for the last five years and you know it, you thick-skulled, old Pollack son of a bitch.
WALT Here's ten, keep the change.
BARBER See you in three weeks, you prick.
WALT If you live that long, dipshit.
WALT Walt and Martin shake hands and Walt walks out.
36 Walt gets in his old Ford pickup and drives off.
36 This is a very bad, rundown neighborhood.
37 Sue walks with her ridiculous Wigger (urban white kid) boyfriend, TREY.
37 Trey wears big baggy pants, a sports jersey and an Oakland Raiders visor upside-down and backwards.
37 They walk past three BLACK GUYS leaning against a building.
37 The TALL BLACK GUY spots Sue and smiles.
TALL BLACK GUY Hey, girl, you come over here and talk to me.
TALL BLACK GUY Come on, baby, don't be shy.
TALL BLACK GUY Trey and Sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can to avoid the black guys.
TALL BLACK GUY They try to ignore them.
TALL BLACK GUY Come on, sweetie, don't be like that.
TALL BLACK GUY You talk to me, don't be all stuck up and shit.
ACROSS THE STREET Walt waits at a stoplight.
ACROSS THE STREET He watches Sue and Trey and the three black guys who block their path.
ACROSS THE STREET One black guy flips Trey's VISOR onto the ground.
ACROSS THE STREET The Tall Guy makes ?kissy faces? at Sue as he touches his crotch.
ACROSS THE STREET Walt sits there for a second; he shouldn't help, but Walt solves every situation by being aggressive.
ACROSS THE STREET Walt drives off, then makes a U-turn.
ACROSS THE STREET The Tall Black Guy now focuses on Trey.
TALL BLACK GUY What are you ?sposed to be?
TALL BLACK GUY Trey puts up his hand to ?hi-five.? The Tall Black Guy just looks at him.
TREY Yo, it's cool, dog.
TALL BLACK GUY What the fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
TREY Nothing.
TREY We're going to Red Roost to get some CDs.
TREY That place is trippin', bro.
TALL BLACK GUY What you call me, you fucking with me, bitch?
TALL BLACK GUY You think you're funny?
TREY Nothing.
TREY No.
TALL BLACK GUY I'm warning you, boy.
TALL BLACK GUY What you all come up in here for?
TALL BLACK GUY You here to bring me this present?
TREY Huh?
TALL BLACK GUY This Oriental yummy for me?
TALL BLACK GUY Don't worry, I'll take good care of her.
SUE Great, another asshole with a fetish for Asian girls.
SUE God, it gets so old.
TALL BLACK GUY What's your name, girl?
SUE My name?
SUE It's ?take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.' That's my name.
TALL BLACK GUY You should keep your bitch on a leash, put a choke chain on this whore and yank.
SUE Oh, of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus.
SUE Call me ?whore' and ?bitch' in the same sentence.
PAGE 38 The Tall Black Guy grabs Sue by the arm.
PAGE 38 Trey moves slightly towards Sue and is pushed down into a pile of garbage.
TALL BLACK GUY You think you're pretty funny, don't you?
SUE What, are you gonna hit me now?
SUE That'd pretty much complete the picture.
SUE The Tall Black Guy pushes Sue hard against the wall.
TALL BLACK GUY You don't know when to quit.
TALL BLACK GUY The old, black pickup pulls up and stops next to them.
TALL BLACK GUY Sue, Trey and the black guys look over.
TALL BLACK GUY Walt sits behind the wheel, he looks right through the Tall Black Guy.
TALL BLACK GUY What the fuck you looking at, old man?
WALT You...
WALT and your buddies.
WALT What's the matter with you?
WALT Don't any of you work?
WALT I see you lazy show- offs in the middle of the day, slowly walking across the street or harassing women.
WALT Nobody owes you bastards anything so go out and get a job instead of pushing little girls around, for Christ's sake.
TALL BLACK GUY Why don't you get the fuck out of here, while I'll still let you.
BLACK GUY #2 That's right, bitch.
WALT What makes you spooks think you can bully a couple kids with impunity?
TALL BLACK GUY What?!
TALL BLACK GUY Are you fucking crazy?
WALT Look at me, Slick.
WALT You're crazy if you thinking I'm fooling around.
TALL BLACK GUY You are fucking crazy.
WALT You have to be pretty goddamned dumb to think you can push people around without running into someone who will push back.
WALT The black guys are a bit dumbfounded.
WALT Walt stares them down.
WALT But you might just be dumb enough not to recognize that your luck just ran out.
WALT All bravado drains away from the black guys.
WALT Walt is a rock.
WALT Walt grins slightly and spits on the ground.
TALL BLACK GUY Fuck this guy.
TALL BLACK GUY He ain't worth it.
TALL BLACK GUY The trio walks slowly across the street, forcing a car to miss a green light.
TALL BLACK GUY Trey puts his hand out to shake Walt's...
TREY Man, thanks a lot, mister.
TREY Walt doesn't extend a hand, he lets Trey stand there like an idiot.
TREY Trey slowly lowers his arm.
TREY Walt looks at Trey's outfit.
WALT Go home, clown...
WALT and pull up your goddamned pants.
WALT Walt turns to Sue.
WALT Come on, I'll give you a ride.
38 Walt and Sue drive in silence.
38 Finally Sue speaks up.
SUE So, what's with you, you have some sort of savior complex or something?
WALT What in the hell's the matter with you?
WALT I thought all you Asian girls were supposed to be so smart.
WALT What are you doing walking around in that neighborhood?
WALT That's how you end up in the obituaries, that is, if they can identify your body once they pull it out of the goddamned river.
SUE I know, I know.
SUE Take it easy.
SUE Walt looks at her for a second.
SUE She's not ruffled at all.
SUE They drive.
WALT So, that goofball back there.
WALT He's your boyfriend?
SUE Yeah, kind of, his name is Trey.
WALT Why in the hell would you go out with a clown like that.
WALT Why don't you date one of your...
WALT own...one of those other...
WALT Hu-mungs.
SUE You mean, Hmong?
SUE We're Hmong, not Hu-mung.
WALT Right.
WALT Hmong.
WALT What is a...
WALT where is Hmong or whatever?
WALT Sue laughs.
SUE Wow!
SUE You're so enlightened.
SUE Hmong isn't a place, it's a people.
PAGE 41 Hmong people come from different parts of Laos and Thailand and China.
WALT Then why are you in my neighborhood, instead of back there?
SUE It's a Vietnam thing.
SUE We fought on your side and when America quit, the Communists starting killing the Hmong, so we came over here.
SUE Walt is quiet for few seconds.
WALT Why'd you pick the Midwest, for Christ's sake?
WALT There's snow on the ground near half the year.
WALT Jungle people on the frozen tundra?
SUE Hill people.
SUE We were hill people, not jungle people.
SUE Boo-ga, boo- ga, boo-ga.
WALT Whatever.
SUE Blame the Lutherans.
SUE They brought us here.
WALT Still, you'd think the cold would keep all the assholes away.
WALT Sue laughs again at Walt's conscienceless racism.
SUE Thanks for the ride.
WALT Sure...
WALT You know, you seem okay.
WALT What the hell's the matter with your half-wit brother?
WALT He a little slow or something?
SUE Tao is actually really bright, he just doesn't know which direction to go in.
WALT Oh, poor Toad.
SUE It's really common.
SUE Hmong girls over here fit in better, we adjust.
SUE The girls go to college, the boys go to jail.
39 Walt drinks coffee and reads the newspaper.
39 He flips from section to section.
39 Daisy's at his feet.
39 Next door, Phong sits watching Walt.
39 He can see her mumbling under her breath.
WALT Old hag, giving me the evil eye?
WALT Walt opens the paper to the TV guide section and lingers at the HOROSCOPES for a second.
WALT Aw, what the hell...
WALT Walt reads aloud to himself.
WALT Your birthday today; This year you have to make a choice between two life paths.
WALT Second chances come your way.
WALT Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anti-climax.
WALT Your lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and
99. Walt drains his coffee and tosses the paper onto the porch.
WALT What a load of crap.
WALT Walt lights up a cigarette and exhales.
WALT Walt watches as the only white woman on the block struggles to unload her groceries from her car.
WALT One of her bags rips.
PAGE 43 Three teenagers walk past and laugh at her spilled groceries.
PAGE 43 One of them makes a crude gesture behind her back.
WALT Christ all Friday.
WALT What's wrong with kids today?
WALT Walt gets up to go help, but before he can get to the sidewalk, another neighbor has gone over to help...
WALT It's TAO.
WALT Tao bends down and carries her bags up to her door.
WALT Well, I'll be damned.
40 Mitch and Karen sit across from Walt.
40 A small store- bought birthday cake sits in front of Walt.
40 Walt reads his birthday card.
40 It's signed; Love Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh.
40 ALL the signatures have been written in a woman's cursive style and with the same pen.
40 Mitch slides a wrapped gift across the table to Walt.
MITCH Go ahead, Dad.
MITCH Open it.
WALT What is it?
MITCH Just open it.
MITCH Walt opens the package, it's a Gopher Reaching Tool -- the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can pick up objects that have fallen behind the stove, etc.
MITCH Walt looks at his son and daughter-in-law.
MITCH It's a Gopher.
MITCH It's so you can reach stuff.
MITCH You know, it makes things easier.
KAREN Here's one from me.
KAREN KAREN slides over a another wrapped gift.
KAREN Walt opens it.
KAREN It's a PHONE with really big numbers for old people.
KAREN It's a phone.
WALT Thank you, Karen.
KAREN I just thought...
KAREN we thought that it would...
KAREN make things easier.
WALT Yeah, I see that.
KAREN There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
MITCH Karen's right, Dad.
MITCH You've worked hard your whole life.
MITCH Maybe you should think about taking it a little easier?
MITCH Walt lights up a cigarette.
MITCH And that's another thing, Dad.
MITCH You should get rid of the coffin nails.
MITCH Walt says nothing.
MITCH And the house, now that Mom's gone, it's got to be a lot to maintain, let alone clean...
MITCH and you're all alone in here.
MITCH It's worse than Walt thought.
MITCH He puffs smoke.
KAREN There's these great places now, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.
KAREN People who are like you, alert, active, but are alone and would benefit by being with other folks their own age.
MITCH Dad, take a look.
MITCH We brought some pamphlets.
41 Mitch and Karen storm out to their Land Cruiser.
41 Mitch carries the Gopher Grabber Tool and Karen has the big numbered phone in her hand.
MITCH I told you, I told you this was a bad idea.
KAREN I know, you were right.
MITCH Son of a bitch!
MITCH He just won't let anyone help him.
KAREN Well, we tried.
KAREN Now we can just drop it.
KAREN No one can say we didn't try.
MITCH To hell with him, kicking us out on his birthday?!
MITCH We should've stayed home with Ashley and Josh.
MITCH They knew better, they wouldn't even come.
MITCH The goddamned kids are smarter than we are!
MITCH Mitch screeches the tires as they take off.
MITCH Walt waits for them to clear out, before coming out on the porch with a can of Pabst.
MITCH Daisy comes out and lies at his feet.
MITCH Walt covers his mouth as he coughs.
MITCH A dime-sized circle of dark, red blood is left in the palm of his hand.
MITCH Walt looks at the blood as he takes another sip of beer.
42 Walt continues to sit on his porch, a long row of empty Pabst beer cans are lined up on the railing.
PAGE 46 Walt looks at a photo in his wallet, his and Dorothy's wedding photo.
PAGE 46 Walt looks down at Daisy --
WALT We miss Momma, don't we, Daisy.
WALT A vehicle pulls up to Tao's house.
WALT A party is in full swing.
WALT Sue comes out and helps the Hmong women unload big platters of food and carry them to the house.
WALT Sue catches Walt's gaze and steps over to his porch.
SUE Hey, Walt, what are you up to?
SUE Walt points his index finger at the can of Pabst in his hand.
SUE We're having a barbecue.
SUE You want to come over?
WALT What do you think?
SUE There's tons of food.
WALT I'll bet.
WALT Just keep your paws off my dog.
SUE No worries, we only eat cats.
WALT Really?
SUE No, I'm kidding, you moron.
SUE Come on, come on over.
SUE You can be my special guest.
WALT I'm fine right here.
WALT Walt reaches into the cooler for another beer.
WALT It's empty, just water and ice.
WALT Son of a bitch.
SUE What have you had to eat today, Walt?
WALT A piece of cake and some beef jerky.
SUE Come on over and get something to eat.
SUE We've got beer, too.
SUE Walt exhales loudly --
WALT Oh, what the hell.
WALT It's my birthday, I may as well drink with strangers instead of myself.
WALT Walt gets up and walks with Sue towards her house.
SUE Happy Birthday, Wally.
WALT Don't call me Wally.
43 Inside are thirty Hmong and Walt, who sticks out like a sore thumb.
43 Total fish out of water.
43 Walt looks in the refrigerator, Sue looks over his shoulder.
WALT You do have a lot of beer, but no Pabst.
SUE As they say, When in Hmong.
WALT Ha ha.
WALT Are you sure it's okay I'm here?
WALT Everyone keeps looking at me and when I look back, they look at the ground.
SUE It's fine.
SUE Phong appears from the crowd and points at Walt.
PHONG You, get out.
PHONG Out of our house!
PHONG What is he doing here?
PHONG Walt cringes at her presence.
WALT What'd she say?
SUE She said welcome to our home.
WALT No she didn't.
SUE No, she didn't.
PHONG Why is this white man in our home?
PHONG A man like him brings nothing, nothing but sorrow and death.
PHONG Several relatives usher Phong away from Walt.
PHONG The relatives are embarrassed at the outburst.
WALT She hates me.
SUE Yes, she hates you.
WALT What did I do?
WALT A little Hmong girl walks past and Walt pats her on the head.
WALT Everyone in the room looks in horror at Walt.
WALT What?!
WALT What the hell are all you fish heads looking at?!
WALT Sue looks around and then pulls Walt out of the room.
SUE Maybe we should go in the other room.
44 Sue explains a few facts to Walt.
SUE A lot of the people in this house are very traditional.
SUE Number one, never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child.
SUE Hmong people believe that the soul resides in the head, so don't do that.
WALT That's dumb, but fine.
SUE Hmong people also consider looking someone in the eye to be rude.
SUE That's why everyone looks away when you look at them.
WALT Swell.
WALT Anything else?
SUE Yeah, some Hmong smile or grin when they're yelled at or get into a confrontation.
SUE It's a cultural thing.
SUE It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, not that they're laughing at you.
WALT Good God, you people are all nuts.
45 Walt opens another beer, as Sue speaks Hmong to a relative.
45 Walt notices an Old Hmong Man staring at him.
45 Walt interrupts Sue.
WALT Hey, Sue.
SUE What?
WALT You said you guys don't look you in the eye, but that guy keeps staring at me.
WALT Sue laughs and gestures to the Old Hmong Man.
WALT The Old Hmong Man steps over and nods to Walt.
SUE This is Kor Khue.
SUE He's the Lor family shaman.
WALT Witch doctor?
WALT Sue smiles and nods.
SUE Something like that.
SUE The Hmong hold their clan Shaman in very high regards.
WALT Boo-ga, boo-ga.
WALT Kor Khue says something to Sue in Hmong.
WALT She turns and translates to Walt.
SUE Kor Khue is interested in you, he heard what you did.
SUE He says he would like to read you.
WALT Huh?
SUE He wants to read you.
SUE Tell you your soul.
SUE It'd be rude not to allow him this, it's a great honor.
WALT Tell Kor to be my guest, fire away.
WALT Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman.
WALT The Shaman responds and sits down across from Walt.
WALT He looks at Walt for a long time.
WALT Walt stares straight back at him.
WALT The Shaman mumbles to himself.
WALT Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly.
WALT As Sue translates, the Shaman watches Walt's reaction.
SUE Kor Khue says that you think you've been disrespected.
SUE You do not live your life.
SUE Your food has no flavor.
SUE You are scared of your past.
PAGE 51 You stopped living years and years ago.
PAGE 51 Kor Khue says you're not at peace.
PAGE 51 Walt looks like he's been hit by a truck.
PAGE 51 The Shaman watches Walt closely, he knows he hit the nail on the head.
PAGE 51 Walt looks pale.
PAGE 51 He's been spooked good.
PAGE 51 He wipes sweat from his forehead.
WALT Excuse me.
WALT Walt gets up and steps into the kitchen.
WALT He takes several deep breaths.
WALT He's pretty shook up.
WALT Je -- zuz -- Christ.
WALT Walt looks around at all the Hmongs eating and carrying on.
WALT Walt sees a young man give up his seat to an Elder.
WALT Walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks and offer tea and cookies from a tray.
WALT Walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom.
WALT Walt coughs hard.
WALT He wipes blood from his lips.
WALT Sue comes in and looks at Walt.
SUE Are you okay?
SUE Walt brushes past her and goes into the bathroom.
EPIPHANY. Walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands.
EPIPHANY. He's still pale.
EPIPHANY. He looks long and hard in the mirror.
EPIPHANY. Walt is stunned, it all adds up.
EPIPHANY. Walt hasn't really lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let his guard down since he got back from Korea in 1953.
WALT Son of a bitch.
WALT I've got more in common with these goddamned gooks than my own spoiled-rotten family.
PAGE 52 Walt looks at himself.
WALT Happy birthday.
WALT Walt opens the bathroom door.
WALT Sue stands there with a concerned look on her face.
SUE Are you okay?
WALT Me?
WALT I'm fine.
SUE You were bleeding?
SUE Walt smiles disarmingly.
WALT I just bit my tongue.
WALT I'm fine.
WALT I'm great.
WALT Let's get some of that gook food, I'm starving.
47 Walt sits amongst several old Hmong Women, who take great delight in feeding him different Hmong dishes which he's obviously never tasted before.
47 Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food, occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc.
47 This corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong ladies.
47 Sue comes in and rolls her eyes at Walt.
SUE Come on, you glutton, let's go downstairs.
WALT Why?
SUE To mingle.
WALT I'm fine right here.
WALT I'm mingling.
SUE Come on, you said ?not to leave you alone.'
48 Walt and Sue descend the stairway.
48 Walt is really out of his element down with all the Hmong teenagers.
48 And the first person he sees across the room is Tao.
WALT Oh great.
SUE Well, look who's over there.
WALT What's-his-name who tried to steal my Gran Torino.
SUE My brother Tao.
WALT Yeah, Toad.
WALT Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze.
WALT Sue walks over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone.
WALT Walt doesn't know what to do with himself.
WALT He leans against the DRYER.
WALT The DRYER wobbles.
WALT Walt gets on his hands and knees.
WALT He looks under the dryer.
WALT He adjusts the short leg to balance out the machine.
WALT He just can't help it.
WALT All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a dryer during a party.
WALT Walt looks up -- deer in the headlights.
WALT It was wobbly, but I fixed it.
WALT It's fine now, shouldn't wobble anymore.
WALT The Hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with their hands.
WALT Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from his face.
WALT Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink.
WALT What's this?
SUE Rice liquor.
SUE Try it.
WALT Alright.
WALT Sue walks off.
WALT Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the interaction between the boys and girls.
WALT One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL stares across the room at Tao.
WALT Tao looks back at her, but then looks away.
WALT The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her hair.
WALT Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do.
WALT They do their best to charm her.
WALT She's polite, but not interested, she keeps looking at Tao.
WALT Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this wasted opportunity.
WALT Suddenly the Girl steps over to Walt.
WALT She smiles --
WA XAM (GIRL) My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here?
WALT Good question.
WALT What am I doing here?
WALT Anyways, I'm Walt.
WA XAM Hi, Walt.
WA XAM I'm Wa Xam.
WALT Wa Yum?
WA XAM No, Wa Xam.
WA XAM So...
WA XAM what do you do?
WALT Me?
WALT Not too much...
WALT I fix stuff I guess.
WA XAM Like what?
WALT Well, I fixed my wife's friend's sink yesterday.
PAGE 55 I drove my aunt to the doctor to straighten out her prescription.
PAGE 55 Even fixed my screen door before it was broke.
WA XAM You're funny.
WALT That's one thing I've never been accused of.
WALT A bastard, yes.
WALT Funny, no.
WALT Wa Xam laughs.
WA XAM Well, have fun.
WA XAM I'm going to take off.
WALT A pleasure to meet you, Yum Yum.
WALT She laughs at Walt butchering her name and goes upstairs.
WALT The three young suitors follow her up.
WALT Tao watches her.
WALT Walt comes over to Tao, who is startled.
WALT Walt laughs.
WALT Relax, zipper head, whatta you think I'm gonna do, shoot you?
WALT Tao looks like he wants to run away.
WALT I wouldn't say anything either, if I was you.
WALT Walt sips his rice liquor.
WALT Walt can't help but rib Tao.
WALT You know, I knew you were a dipshit even before the whole garage deal, but I have to say you're even worse with women than you are stealing cars, Toad.
TAO It's Tao.
WALT What's that?
TAO It's Tao, not Toad.
TAO My name is Tao.
WALT Good for you.
WALT Anyways, you're blowing it with that girl.
WALT Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you.
TAO You don't know what you're talking about.
WALT Wrong, egg roll.
WALT I completely know what I'm talking about.
WALT I know I'm not always the most pleasant person to be around, but I got the greatest woman who ever lived to marry me.
WALT I had to work at it, but I got her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.
WALT Hands down.
WALT Walt points across the room.
WALT He sways slightly.
WALT But you?
WALT You just sit there and watch as Ding Dong and Click Clack and Charlie Chan walk away with what's-her-face.
WALT She likes you, you know.
TAO Who?
WALT She was standing over there, orange dress, twisting her hair and smiling at you.
TAO You mean Wa Xam?
TAO Walt takes a long swig off his drink and nods.
WALT Yeah, yeah.
WALT Anyways, she likes you, I know, I talked to her.
WALT Great girl, charming girl.
WALT Love her.
WALT I love Yum Yum.
WALT But you?
WALT You just watch her walk out the door with the Three Stooges.
WALT Why?
WALT Because you're a big fat pussy!
WALT Walt drains his drink.
WALT I gotta go home.
WALT Good luck, puss- cake.
WALT You need it.
49 Walt empties the lawnmower bag as two elderly Hmong Women come over, each carrying a FLOWER BOUQUET.
WALT No.
WALT No thanks.
WALT No more flowers.
WALT The elderly Hmong Women nod and speak rapid sentences in Hmong to Walt.
WALT He has no idea what they are saying.
WALT No more.
WALT Please, keep your flowers.
WALT The Hmong women nod, smile and chatter away, ignoring Walt.
WALT They walk past him and set the BOUQUETS on his porch.
WALT Okay, just put them on the porch.
WALT But that's it.
WALT No more.
50 The doorbell rings.
50 Walt answers, a Skillsaw in one hand.
50 Standing on his doorstep are three Hmong women.
WALT What now, Gee?
WALT Gee holds up a plate covered with tinfoil.
WALT No.
WALT Forget it.
WALT Stop bringing me stuff.
WALT Gee scolds Walt in Hmong.
WALT No.
WALT I've had it.
WALT Gee opens the corner of the tinfoil.
WALT Walt looks at the food.
WALT I can't.
WALT You have to stop.
WALT Gee pulls the tinfoil off.
WALT Walt gazes at the food.
WALT Is that the chicken dumpling thing you brought the other day?
51 Walt pulls up in his pickup truck.
51 Sue and Vu wait on Walt's porch.
51 Tao stands out on the sidewalk.
51 Walt gets out of his pickup.
WALT What now?
WALT What?
WALT Vu rambles on in Hmong.
WALT Walt looks at his watch.
WALT He looks at Sue for the translation.
SUE Tao is here to make amends, he's here to work for you.
WALT No he's not.
SUE Mother says that Tao dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt.
SUE He'll start tomorrow morning.
WALT No.
WALT The kid is useless, I don't even want him on my property.
WALT I thought we already went over that.
SUE It's very important to my mother that you accept.
SUE It'd be an insult to refuse.
WALT How is this all of a sudden turned around on me?
WALT The goddamned kid tries to steal my car and somehow I'm the bad guy if I don't accept?
SUE My family is very traditional and it will very much upset them if you don't let Tao repay...
SUE Tao interrupts from the sidewalk...
TAO Come on, Sue.
TAO If he doesn't want to, let's just go.
TAO Sue and Vu yell at Tao to shut up at the same time; Sue in English, Vu in Hmong.
SUE/VU Shut up.
SUE/VU Shut up!
SUE/VU Shut up!!
SUE/VU Tao looks at the ground.
SUE/VU A PAUSE.
SUE/VU Walt sees the earnest looks on the Hmong women's faces.
SUE/VU Their expression ?begs? Walt.
SUE/VU Walt gazes back at Tao.
SUE/VU Walt looks disgusted, he exhales loudly...
WALT Fine.
WALT Great.
WALT Tomorrow.
WALT Walt walks past them and into his house.
WALT Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
WALT These Hmong broads are like badgers.
52 Walt sits drinking coffee and reading the newspaper.
52 Tao walks sheepishly over to the property line.
WALT Son of a bitch, I didn't think he'd show.
WALT Walt waves Tao over.
WALT Tao barely looks at Walt.
WALT Okay.
WALT What are you good at?
TAO Like what?
WALT That's what I'm asking.
WALT What are you good at?
PAGE 60 If you're gonna work for me, I have to know what you can do.
TAO I don't know.
WALT That's about what I expected.
WALT Okay, why don't you go over by the spruce tree and count how many birds feed at the bird feeder.
TAO Count the birds?
WALT Yeah, you can count?
WALT You slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
TAO Yes, I can count.
53 Tao stands in Walt's garden with his arms folded.
53 Walt walks over to trim weeds around the garden fence.
53 Walt doesn't even look at Tao.
53 Finally...
TAO You want me to do that?
WALT No.
TAO Why not?
WALT I want it done right, that's why.
TAO But you've got me just standing here.
TAO What am I supposed to be doing, anyway?
WALT Scaring away crows.
WALT Tao shoots Walt a dirty look.
WALT It's a perfect job for you, plus you people don't seem to mind squinting in the sun all day.
54 Walt waters a flower bed.
54 Tao comes over and stands there.
54 Walt finishes watering before even looking at Tao.
TAO What do you have for me today?
TAO You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
WALT Don't get flip with me, zipper head.
WALT I ain't the one who tried to steal and don't forget it.
TAO Go ahead.
TAO I don't care if you insult me and say racist things.
TAO I'll take it.
WALT That I know.
WALT You have no teeth, kid.
WALT That's your problem.
WALT You have no balls.
TAO Look, I'm stuck here.
TAO Why don't you give me something useful to do.
WALT Because unlike you I'm not useless.
WALT I maintain my property, whereas you swamp rats let your houses go to hell.
WALT Walt looks across the street at one very dilapidated house.
WALT Wait a minute...
WALT How long do I have you for?
WALT Tao pauses...
WALT he doesn't want to answer.
WALT How long, Toad?
TAO Till next Friday.
TAO Walt laughs out loud.
TAO It makes Tao cringe.
WALT Go get my ladder out of the garage.
55 Tao is at the top of the LADDER.
55 Walt and the Hmong neighbor grin at him from the bottom.
WALT When you're done caulking the siding, nail that gutter back up, I can see it right out my kitchen window, it's been bugging me for three years.
WALT The neighbor says something in Hmong to Walt.
WALT You said it, brother.
56 Tao digs up a big TREE STUMP out in the rain.
56 It's hard, draining labor and Tao is covered with mud.
56 Tao's shovel hits rocks and roots and clay.
56 Misery.
57 We see Tao do various chores; scrape paint, hang screen doors, reattach house numbers, trim bushes, etc.
57 Walt scrutinizes his every move.
57 Tao is a virtual slave.
58 Walt watches with great satisfaction as Tao paints one of the neighboring houses.
58 The neighborhood is really shaping up.
58 Walt sips his coffee with a slight grin.
58 He is really, really, really enjoying this.
PAGE 63 A very old Hmong man and his very young GRANDSON walk up Walt's driveway.
PAGE 63 The Grandson translates for grandpa.
GRANDSON Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch?
GRANDSON Walt reaches in his pocket and studies a small note pad.
WALT I don't see why not.
WALT Tell him sometime after lunch.
59 Tao walks up the sidewalk.
59 Before ringing the doorbell, Tao looks down at his hands which have several CALLOUSES on them.
59 Tao rubs his hands with a smile.
59 This has been the first time Tao has really risen to a task presented to him.
59 Tao reaches for the doorbell...
60 Walt stands over the sink, coughing.
60 In the b.g.
60 the doorbell rings.
60 Walt coughs up a big spot of blood, it's thick with fibers.
60 The doorbell rings again.
60 Walt wipes his mouth and runs the water in the sink.
61 Walt answers the door, just as Tao rings the doorbell a third time.
61 Walt looks angry.
WALT Jesus Lord almighty, knock it off.
TAO It's my last day, whatta you want me to do?
WALT Take the day off, you've done enough.
PAGE 64 Tao looks disappointed, but says nothing.
PAGE 64 He nods and starts to walk away.
PAGE 64 Walt calls after him...
WALT Toad.
WALT Tao turns around.
WALT Walt wants to say something, but stops.
WALT Nothing, never mind.
WALT Walt shuts the door.
62 Walt sits in the crowded waiting room.
62 He looks around.
62 He's the only WHITE PERSON in the room.
62 Even most of the STAFF is African or from India.
62 As Walt waits, names are called out such as Alvarez, Ngaima, Yang and Abdalla.
62 Finally when the name ?Kowalski? is called, the Muslim woman can't pronounce it correctly.
62 Walt winces.
63 Walt sits in a chair, his hands folded in his lap.
63 A short Asian man in a doctor's smock comes in with a chart.
ASIAN DOCTOR Mr. Kowalski?
WALT That's right.
ASIAN DOCTOR Good afternoon.
ASIAN DOCTOR I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start on a full battery of tests.
ASIAN DOCTOR I feel that this...
WALT Wait a minute.
WALT Where's my regular doctor, where's Dr. Fellman?
ASIAN DOCTOR Dr. Fellman retired three years ago.
ASIAN DOCTOR I'm his replacement, Dr.
ASIAN DOCTOR Chang.
WALT Jesus Christ.
64 Mitch, Karen and Ashley are in the kitchen.
64 The phone rings and Ashley looks at the caller ID.
ASHLEY It's Grandpa Walt.
KAREN Well, pick it up.
ASHLEY You talk to him.
KAREN Mitch?
MITCH I'm doing bills here.
KAREN He's your father.
KAREN Ashley hands him the phone and he pushes the TALK button.
MITCH Hello, Dad.
WALT (V.O.) Hello?
WALT (V.O.) It's me...
WALT (V.O.) Dad.
MITCH I know.
MITCH What's up?
MITCH The CAMERA INTERCUTS BETWEEN Mitch in his huge kitchen and Walt sitting on the edge of his bed.
WALT Um...
WALT not much, how about you?
MITCH I'm fine, fine.
WALT Fine.
WALT That's fine...
WALT How about the kids and Karen?
MITCH Everyone is fine.
WALT Good.
WALT There is a long, uncomfortable pause.
WALT Walt looks at some Xeroxed medical pamphlets scattered on his bed.
MITCH Good.
WALT Well, that's good...
WALT How's...
WALT work?
MITCH Busy.
WALT Right.
WALT I s'pose.
MITCH Speaking of busy, I have a lot on my plate right now, unless there's something pressing.
MITCH Walt looks at a pale, blue pamphlet.
MITCH Mitch looks at his housekeeping bill.
WALT No.
WALT Nope.
WALT Another pause.
WALT Okay then.
MITCH Okay.
MITCH Yeah, so it's not a good time right now.
MITCH Why don't you call me over the weekend.
WALT Sure.
MITCH Okay, it was nice talking to you, bye, Dad.
MITCH Walt hangs up.
MITCH He lies down on his bed.
65 While Walt fills a bird feeder, he notices Tao next door.
65 Tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder, trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw.
65 Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao.
WALT Hey, moron.
WALT Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.
TAO What?
WALT I appreciate you're doing something on your own, but you're the only person I know dumb enough to get himself killed trimming tree branches.
TAO What now?
WALT You don't stand on the top step of a ladder and if you cut through that branch you're hacking away at, you'll end up kaput.
WALT Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black POWER LINE is five feet below the branch he's almost severed.
WALT Go grab the extension ladder from my garage and I'll show you how to do it right, zipper head.
66 Tao ties up bundles of branches and twigs.
66 Walt lights a cigarette, looks up in the tree and nods.
WALT Looks good.
WALT Good job.
WALT Tao nods.
WALT Make sure you put the ladder back when you're done raking up the leaves.
TAO I know.
TAO I will.
TAO Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the cooler and watches Tao rake.
TAO A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past Tao.
TAO Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass.
WALT This kid doesn't have a chance.
WALT The Honda now slowly passes Walt's house.
WALT Walt just stands there, sipping his beer.
WALT The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at Walt.
WALT The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens.
WALT Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN.
WALT He closes one eye to better ?aim? his imaginary gun and moves his thumb several times as if firing.
WALT Bang -- bang -- bang.
WALT The Honda takes off.
WALT Walt watches it drive off and lights another cigarette.
WALT Walt doesn't notice, but Tao witnessed this whole interaction from his yard.
67 The doorbell rings.
67 Walt opens his door.
67 Tao stands there with his hands in his pockets.
67 He's a bit apprehensive.
TAO What do you know about faucets?
TAO Walt stares at him for a second and then laughs.
68 Tao looks on as Walt turns the faucet on and off, it drips water at its base.
68 Walt looks under the sink.
WALT For the love of Pete.
TAO What?
WALT It must be a hundred degrees in here, turn on the fan.
WALT Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off.
WALT Walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head.
69 The CEILING FAN and FAUCET are taken apart on the workbench.
69 Walt reinstalls the diverter valve.
69 Tao looks at all of Walt's tools.
TAO Man, where did you get all this stuff?
WALT What are you talking about?
TAO All the tools and stuff.
WALT Where the hell do you think I got them, Toad?
WALT This may come as a shock to a thief, but I actually bought the things I have with money I earned.
TAO Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what I meant.
TAO There's just so much shit packed in here.
WALT You need the right tool for the right job.
WALT Every single thing here has a purpose.
TAO Okay, what's this?
TAO Tao points to a tool.
WALT Post hole digger.
WALT Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick succession, questioning Walt with his expression.
WALT Hand spade.
WALT Tin snips.
WALT Nail punch.
WALT Tack hammer.
WALT Putty knife.
WALT Wire stripper.
WALT Drywall saw.
WALT Tile spacers.
WALT Silence.
WALT Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but he's too uncomfortable to speak up --
WALT What?
TAO I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
WALT I didn't buy all this stuff at once, blockhead.
WALT I've lived here for fifty years.
WALT A man stays in one place long enough he tends to attract a decent set of tools.
TAO Yeah, but...
WALT Look, kid, I think I know where you're going with this.
WALT You don't need everything to maintain a house.
WALT I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
WALT Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE items in quick succession.
WALT This is for you.
WALT Roll of duct tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of vise-grips.
WALT Any man who's worth a shit can do half his household jobs with these three things.
WALT In the odd chance that doesn't work out, you can borrow something.
TAO Okay.
TAO Cool.
TAO Walt coughs and covers his mouth.
TAO Both Tao and Walt see the spot of BLOOD in his hand.
TAO What's with that?
WALT What's with what?
TAO The blood you just coughed up.
TAO That's not good, you should see a doctor.
TAO Walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub.
WALT So...
WALT what exactly was the deal with those guys out on my lawn that night?
WALT Who are they?
TAO A gang.
TAO Hmong gangbangers.
WALT I gathered that.
WALT What did they want with you?
TAO They wanted to take me away because I blew my first initiation.
WALT You joined up with those pukes?
WALT Damn, you are a pussy.
WALT Why in the hell did you do that?
TAO I don't know.
TAO They were persuasive.
TAO My cousin's in the gang.
TAO They just talked me into it I guess.
WALT Well, at least you're honest about it.
WALT A LONG SILENCE.
WALT Walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan.
WALT So how'd you blow your first initiation?
WALT Tao nods towards the GRAN TORINO.
WALT The Gran Torino?
WALT Tao nods.
WALT Walt laughs.
WALT Christ all Friday.
70 Walt straps an old WESTINGHOUSE FREEZER onto a two- wheeled DOLLY.
70 Walt attempts to pull the freezer upstairs.
70 Walt strains with the heavy appliance.
70 It's too much weight for Walt, but this doesn't stop him from heaving and pulling.
70 Walt could have done this by himself when he was younger.
70 Walt sits down on the step and breathes hard.
71 Mitch watches afternoon baseball, drinking an imported, bottled beer.
71 KAREN pokes her head into the room.
KAREN See you later, I'm taking the kids to the mall.
KAREN Mitch never looks up from the TV.
MITCH Yeah, fine.
MITCH Just don't spend too much goddamned money.
KAREN I will.
KAREN We hear Karen and the kids exit.
MITCH Thank God.
MITCH Finally get the house to myself for once.
MITCH The PHONE RINGS.
MITCH Mitch looks at the Caller ID.
MITCH It says; ?Dad.? Mitch almost doesn't pick it up...
MITCH Hello.
WALT (V.O.) Hello?
WALT (V.O.) It's me, Dad...
WALT (V.O.) Walt.
MITCH Hey, Dad.
MITCH What's up?
MITCH The CAMERA INTERCUTS BETWEEN Walt in his small kitchen and Mitch in his huge den.
WALT Well...
WALT I...
WALT um...
WALT I'm getting the old Westinghouse up out of the basement.
WALT Mitch mouths the word ?Shit.?
MITCH Uh-huh.
WALT So...
WALT I got it on the dolly.
MITCH Yeah, that'll help.
WALT Yeah...
WALT And it's a bit heavy...
WALT for one guy.
MITCH Uh-huh.
WALT Yeah...
WALT I need a hand.
MITCH Oh.
WALT So are you busy?
MITCH Does it have to be done right this second?
MITCH It's been down there for years.
WALT Well...
WALT Yeah, I'd like to get on it.
MITCH Does it work?
MITCH We were thinking about getting a freezer.
MITCH What are you going to do with it?
WALT Giving it to Aunt Mary.
MITCH Oh...
MITCH Can't she give you a hand?
WALT She's eighty-one.
MITCH I know, I was joking...
MITCH What does she need it for?
WALT To freeze food.
WALT Mitch opens another beer.
MITCH Yeah, well, I'd love to help you out, Dad, but I'm just walking out the door.
MITCH I have to bring the kids to the mall.
MITCH Sorry.
WALT Uh-huh.
MITCH Why don't you call Stevie?
WALT Your brother lives out of state.
MITCH Well, I don't know what to tell you, I'm on my way out.
MITCH Keys in my hand.
WALT Okay then.
MITCH If you can't find anyone by next week, give me a call.
MITCH Walt nods and hangs up.
MITCH Mitch hangs up and takes a sip of beer.
MITCH Aunt Mary.
MITCH Like she needs a freezer.
72 The doorbell rings and Tao opens the door.
72 There stands Walt.
72 Tao is a little shocked.
WALT You got a minute, Toad?
73 Walt and Tao look at the freezer strapped to the dolly.
WALT I just need a little push.
WALT All the weight is up top, so you stay down and give me a little shove at each step.
TAO Let me take the top.
WALT Naw, I got it.
TAO No really, I'll take the top.
TAO It looks pretty heavy.
WALT I'm not crippled.
WALT I got it.
TAO If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping.
TAO I'll go home.
WALT Listen, zipper head, now's not the time to go and...
TAO You listen, old man.
TAO You came and got me because you needed help, so let me help you.
TAO Either it's top or I'm out of here.
TAO Walt studies Tao for a second.
TAO Tao doesn't blink, he holds his ground.
TAO Walt nods, trying not to grin.
WALT Okay then, be my guest.
WALT Just don't let it slip out of your little girl hands and crush me.
WALT Tao laughs.
TAO Don't give me any ideas.
74 Tao and Walt ease the freezer down the back steps and pause to take a break.
74 They both breathe hard.
TAO That thing weighs a ton.
WALT Yeah, but it runs like new.
WALT They don't make them like that anymore.
TAO What are you going to do with it?
WALT Sell it.
WALT I haven't used it in years and it was always in the way down there.
TAO How much?
WALT Oh, I don't know.
WALT Sixty bucks, maybe.
WALT Why, you need a freezer?
TAO Our downstairs one died.
TAO Walt thinks for a second.
WALT Twenty-five and it's yours.
TAO Twenty-five?
TAO You just said sixty?
WALT Save me from wasting money on putting an ad in the paper.
75 Walt and Sue sit eating Laab as they watch Tao, who washes and waxes the Gran Torino in Walt's driveway.
75 Sue laughs and shakes her head.
SUE Kind of ironic, huh?
WALT What?
SUE What the hell do you think I'm referring to?
SUE Toad washing the car he tried to steal from you.
WALT It seems like justice to me.
WALT And if he misses a spot, he's doing it all over.
SUE It's nice of you to kind of look after him like this.
SUE He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
WALT I ain't a role model.
SUE You're a good man, Wally.
SUE I wish our dad would have been more like you.
WALT Don't call me Wally.
SUE No, I'm serious.
SUE He was hard on us, really traditional, really old school.
WALT I'm old school.
SUE Yeah, but you're American.
WALT What's that supposed to mean?
WALT Sue shrugs him off.
WALT They look at Tao for awhile.
SUE You like him, don't you?
WALT Him?
WALT Don't be crazy.
WALT He tried to steal my car.
SUE And you spend time with him and you teach him how to fix things and you saved him from that fuck cousin of ours and...
WALT Hey.
WALT Watch the language.
SUE And you're a good man.
WALT Hand me a beer, Dragon Lady.
WALT Sue hands him a beer and Walt pops the top.
WALT So tell me the problem with Hmong boys again.
WALT I'm not completely clear.
SUE Hmong girls slip in and out of the culture more easily.
SUE Date who we want, stay close to our mothers, but are able to keep a foot on each side of the fence.
SUE The boys fall through the cracks.
WALT Why?
SUE It's tough.
SUE The boys float around.
SUE The fathers belong in a totally different world and the boys have no one to turn to.
SUE Does that make sense?
WALT Not sure.
WALT No.
SUE The boys don't ask their fathers for advice, because over here, their fathers no longer have the answers.
PAGE 79 Hmong boys become almost invisible, they end up banding together and it all goes to hell from there.
WALT The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
SUE It's more common than not.
SUE Walt reflects on this for awhile, then changes the subject.
WALT You still going out with that clown?
SUE No.
SUE I dumped him.
SUE He was a dim- wit.
SUE Walt nods.
WALT Good girl.
76 Walt and Tao spread mulch around Walt's vegetable plants.
TAO You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.
WALT Is that why I see you out in your garden all the time?
WALT Besides, zipper head, we ain't in Hu-Mong.
TAO Funny.
TAO Walt lights a cigarette.
TAO You should quit those.
TAO It's bad for you.
WALT So is joining a gang, you dipshit.
TAO Seriously, you should quit, I saw you cough up blood.
WALT So, you ever think about what you want to do with your life?
TAO I don't know.
WALT You've never thought about it?
TAO Of course I have.
WALT Well, while you're thinking about it, try not to stomp all over my chives, you dipshit.
WALT Tao looks down; sure enough, he's standing on Walt's chives.
TAO Sorry.
WALT Put some mulch around the cucumbers.
WALT Tao spreads more mulch.
TAO I was thinking about sales, maybe.
WALT My oldest son's a salesman.
WALT He sells cars.
TAO Does he do well?
WALT License to steal.
WALT I worked in a Ford plant for thirty years and my son sells goddamned Japanese cars.
TAO You made cars?
WALT That's right.
WALT And I put the steering column in the Gran Torino when it rolled down the line in
TAO Wow, that's cool.
WALT It is, isn't it?
TAO Does your son come over much?
WALT How are you going about getting into sales?
WALT You thinking about school?
TAO Kinda.
WALT Well, you should.
TAO School costs money.
WALT Maybe you should get a job and save instead of spreading mulch in my garden.
TAO Maybe you could just pay me.
WALT That's funny.
TAO What kind of job could I get?
WALT Good question.
WALT Who the hell would hire you?
TAO Yeah, I know.
WALT Aw, go on.
WALT I'm kidding.
WALT You could get a job, easy.
TAO Like what?
WALT I'd think about construction.
TAO Me?
TAO Construction?
TAO What, do you have Alzheimer's or something?
WALT Naw, you could hack it.
WALT You just need a little adjustment.
TAO You said yourself I'm worthless and I have soft little girl hands.
WALT That's exactly the point.
WALT I know some guys in the trades, but you have to get your shit together.
WALT We have to man you up a bit.
TAO Man me up?
WALT Yes.
WALT And you should ask out Yum Yum too.
77 Walt and Tao walk up to the barbershop.
WALT You have to learn how guys talk.
WALT Now watch how me and Martin communicate.
WALT We just throw it back and forth.
WALT You ready?
TAO Sure.
WALT Okay, let's go in.
WALT Walt holds the door for Tao and they enter.
WALT The Barber has his feet up reading a Playboy.
BARBER Oh great, a Pollack and a chink.
WALT Afternoon, Martin, you dumb Italian prick.
BARBER Walt, you cheap asshole, I should have known you'd come in, I was having such a pleasant day.
WALT Why, did you jew some blind man out of a few bucks, give him the wrong change?
WALT Walt and the Barber shake hands warmly.
WALT Tao is wide- eyed.
BARBER Who's the Nip?
WALT This is Tao.
WALT He's a pussy kid who lives next door and I'm trying to man him up a little.
WALT Walt points at Tao.
WALT Did you see?
WALT That's how men talk to each other.
TAO They do?
BARBER What, do you have shit in your ears?
WALT Okay.
WALT You go out, come back in and give it a try.
TAO Come on, Walt.
WALT I said go out there, come back in and talk to the barber like a man.
WALT Do it.
WALT Tao shrugs, goes outside, lets the door shut then comes back in.
WALT The Barber stands there with a sneer on his face.
TAO Wus up, you old Italian prick?
TAO The Barber levels a sawed-off SHOTGUN at Tao.
BARBER Get outta my shop before I blow your head off, you long-haired faggy little gook!
BARBER Tao is terrified, frozen stiff.
BARBER Walt and the Barber throw their heads back and laugh.
BARBER The Barber lowers the shotgun.
WALT Jesus Christ, Toad, you don't walk in and insult a guy.
WALT What are you, an idiot?
TAO But...
TAO but that's what you said.
TAO That's what you said men say.
WALT Not if you never met the guy.
WALT If you say that shit to the wrong stranger, they'll blow your goddamned gook head off!
WALT Walt and the Barber laugh again.
TAO What should I have said?
WALT Anything but that.
BARBER Kid, you shoulda just started with ?Hi' or ?Hello.'
WALT Right.
WALT You should have said, ?Excuse me, I'm looking for a haircut if you have time.'
BARBER Yeah.
BARBER Be polite, but don't kiss ass.
WALT Or, even better is act like you just got off a construction job.
PAGE 85 Or bitch about your girlfriend or getting your car fixed.
BARBER Right.
BARBER Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed and those sons a bitches really nailed me.
BARBER Screwed me right in the ass.
WALT Exactly.
WALT Don't swear at the guy you're talking to, swear about another guy who ain't there.
WALT My son of a bitch prick fucking boss made me work overtime and he knew I had bowling tonight.
BARBER Or, my old lady bitches to me for two fucking hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the goddamned game, she starts crying how we never talk.
WALT See?
WALT You come back in, Toad.
WALT Be polite and then you bring up something you can both talk about.
WALT It ain't rocket science.
TAO Yeah, but I don't have a job or a car or a girlfriend.
TAO Walt and the Barber laugh.
BARBER Sweet Jesus, I shoulda blown his head off when I had the chance.
WALT Just go back outside and try it again.
WALT And don't mention you're a pussy with no car, girl, job, future or whatever.
WALT Come in and act like a man, Toad.
WALT Tao goes out, turns around and comes back in.
TAO Excuse me, sir, I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy...
TAO you Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber.
PAGE 86 Walt and the Barber laugh...
TAO Boy does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job.
TAO Walt and the Barber laugh harder.
WALT If you do this, you're going to follow through, right?
TAO Yeah, yeah.
WALT No, not yeah, yeah.
WALT Yes, as in yes, sir, I'll do my best.
TAO Yes, I'll do my best.
WALT You better, because when I vouch for someone, it's my word and I don't want anyone making me look bad.
TAO No, I'm good.
TAO I'm totally into this.
WALT And don't lay down to people all the time.
WALT Always look a person in the eye.
WALT When you shake a man's hand, you can usually tell where you stand with him.
WALT Walt hands a pair of beat-up WORK GLOVES to Tao.
WALT Here, stuff these in your back pocket.
TAO Cool.
WALT Just don't blow this.
PAGE 87 Walt and Tao walk up to the Superintendent's Office Trailer on a construction job site.
79 Walt and Tao come in.
79 Walt shakes hands with TIM KENNEDY, the job super.
WALT Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon, how the hell are ya?
KENNEDY Shitty, but who's gonna listen?
WALT Not me.
WALT Walt pours himself a cup of the bad job-site coffee.
KENNEDY Help yourself, Walt, you dumb Pollack.
WALT I already did.
WALT This is the kid I told you about.
WALT Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he's the super on the job.
WALT Kennedy looks Tao up and down.
WALT Tao looks him in the eye.
KENNEDY What do we got, Walt?
WALT He's done construction here and there.
WALT Whatever you need, he'll pick it up quick.
KENNEDY You sure?
WALT Sure.
KENNEDY You speak English?
TAO Yes, sir.
KENNEDY You born here?
TAO You bet.
KENNEDY You got a vehicle?
KENNEDY I see Walt drove you here.
TAO Not at the moment.
TAO I'm taking the bus for now.
KENNEDY The bus?
KENNEDY Jesus Christ, you don't have a car?
TAO My headgasket cracked and the goddamned prick at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100.
KENNEDY I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200.
TAO Goddamned thieves.
TAO It ain't right.
KENNEDY You got that right.
KENNEDY Come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do.
KENNEDY Tao puts out his hand to shake.
TAO Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
TAO Tim Kennedy shakes Tao's hand.
KENNEDY It's Tim.
KENNEDY What's your name again?
TAO Tao.
KENNEDY Okay.
KENNEDY You owe me one, Walt.
WALT I'll send you a fucking fruitcake at Christmas.
KENNEDY Fuck the fruitcake, why don't you hand over the keys to that Gran Torino.
WALT Yeah, everybody seems to want that car.
KENNEDY I bet.
WALT You don't know the half of it.
WALT Come on, zipper head, let's let this big Mick get back to screwing off.
WALT Walt and Tao exit and walk back to the truck.
80 Walt pulls into a Home Depot parking lot.
TAO What are we doing?
WALT What are you gonna put all your tools in, an empty rice bag?
81 Walt and Tao walk the aisles.
81 Walt grabs a tool belt and tosses it to Tao.
WALT You'll need this.
WALT Walt then tosses Tao a utility knife holder.
WALT And you'll need that.
WALT Now where the hell do they hide the hardware holders?
TAO I can't afford any of this.
WALT I'll get it, but you're paying me back with your first check.
TAO Cool.
TAO Walt pitches a hardware pouch at Tao.
WALT And you need this too.
WALT That should about do it.
TAO Not to bitch, but won't I be needing some tools?
WALT Tools I got, but I ain't loaning you my tool belt.
WALT You can buy tools as you go.
TAO I appreciate all this.
WALT Aw, forget it.
TAO No, I really do.
TAO Thank you.
TAO Walt sticks out his jaw and looks Tao straight in the eye.
TAO Tao doesn't know what to expect.
TAO A PAUSE.
TAO Walt puts out his HAND to Tao.
TAO Tao extends his and they SHAKE HANDS.
TAO It's really quite a moment for both of them.
82 Tao gets off the bus, his tool belt over his shoulder.
82 Tao looks tired after working, but content.
82 He walks past an abandoned lot.
82 The tricked-out Honda pulls up and stops.
82 Smokie, Spider and company get out.
82 Tao looks nervous, but remains calm.
TAO What now?
SPIDER Just seeing what you're up to, cuz.
TAO I'm getting home from work, not that you guys would know much about that.
SPIDER So it's true?
SPIDER You got a job.
TAO Come on, what do you guys want with me?
SMOKIE Jesus Christ, Tao.
SMOKIE What do you think?
SMOKIE I've been sooooo easy on you, but I can't just go on like nothing happened.
TAO You can't just leave me alone?
SMOKIE Afraid not.
SMOKIE The gangbangers grab Tao.
SMOKIE Tao kicks and struggles as they yank away his tool belt.
TAO Keep your hands off my stuff.
SMOKIE Your stuff?
SMOKIE You and everything you have is mine.
SMOKIE I own you.
SMOKIE Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it against the pavement.
SMOKIE Whatever tools Smokie can't destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building.
SMOKIE You can't just walk away from us, Tao.
SMOKIE It looks bad.
SMOKIE It makes me look bad.
SMOKIE Smokie lights a CIGARETTE and exhales...
SMOKIE What's the phrase I'm looking for?
SMOKIE Oh yeah, I need to ?save face.' Smokie grabs Tao by the neck and presses the lit CIGARETTE into Tao's cheek.
SMOKIE Tao screams as his flesh burns.
83 Walt spots Tao as he takes out the trash.
WALT Hey there.
WALT Tao looks to the ground and heads in the other direction.
TAO Hey, I gotta run.
WALT Wait a minute.
WALT Where have you been, I haven't seen you in days?
TAO Busy.
TAO Walt squints at Tao.
TAO He steps closer.
TAO Tao looks away.
TAO Walt tilts Tao's head up, he sees the burn.
WALT What in the hell happened to you?
TAO Don't worry about it.
WALT Don't worry about it?
WALT Look at your goddamned face!
TAO I said don't worry about it.
TAO It's not your problem.
TAO Walt looks at the ground and spits.
WALT When?
TAO Couple days ago.
TAO Grabbed me after I got off the bus coming home from work.
WALT Cowards.
TAO I did everything I could possibly do.
TAO They broke some of your tools.
TAO I'll replace them.
WALT Forget the tools.
WALT Where does your cousin live?
TAO No, Walt, I can manage.
TAO I don't want you doing anything.
TAO Walt is angry, but eventually nods at Tao.
WALT Alright.
WALT You need any other tools for work?
TAO I could use a roofing hammer.
WALT Go in the garage and get whatever you need.
84 Tao leans over his desk with a black Sharpie marker.
84 He carefully writes ?Tao Vang Lor? in black ink on the face of his smashed-up tape measure.
84 He puts it back into the tool belt and grabs another tool to label.
85 Walt sits in the dark, the only light is from the radio tuned to baseball.
85 Daisy lies in the front seat.
85 Next to Daisy is the M1 RIFLE.
85 Walt watches as Spider and another Hmong gangbanger step out of the rundown duplex, get in their Honda and drive off.
WALT That's the last of them.
WALT Walt pulls out his Colt .45 automatic and chambers a round.
86 Walt pounds loudly on the door.
86 A moment later the door starts to swing open and a voice is heard...
SMOKIE What the hell did...
PAGE 94 Walt kicks open the door and grabs Smokie by the collar.
PAGE 94 Walt drags the 105 pound Smokie out of his house and tosses him off the front porch onto the front sidewalk.
PAGE 94 Smokie is stunned.
PAGE 94 Walt kicks him hard in the ribs.
SMOKIE How the fuck did you get here?!
WALT You aren't that hard to track down.
WALT Walt boots him again.
WALT Smokie curls up in the fetal position.
SMOKIE What do you want?
SMOKIE Walt kicks him a second time.
WALT I came to give you a chance.
WALT SOMETHING comes out of the shadows under the porch.
WALT Walt swings the barrel of the big Colt .45 at the movement.
WALT It's a cat.
WALT Walt puts his pistol away.
WALT Smokie exhales.
WALT It's just you and me.
WALT Nobody knows or has to know I was here.
WALT You lay off Tao.
WALT Tell your guys he ain't worth it or whatever the hell you want.
WALT You don't talk to him, you don't go near him.
WALT This is your one chance.
WALT You lay off and no one will ever be the wiser.
WALT Smokie says nothing.
WALT I'll take that as a yes.
WALT I don't want to come back here.
WALT But if I do, believe me, it'll be goddamned ugly.
WALT Walt kicks Smokie again and stalks off into the dark.
87 Walt pulls up his driveway and parks.
87 Daisy jumps out and Walt carries his rifle into the house.
87 Walt walks stiffly.
87 Walt gets to the door and drops his keys.
87 When he bends down to pick them up, you can really tell he's sore and hurting.
87 Walt groans as he goes inside.
87 He's feeling his age.
88 Vu, Sue, Tao and Wa Xam all sit in lawn chairs, talking and laughing.
88 Walt flips the inch-thick STEAKS on his Weber.
WALT How do you want your dog...
WALT I mean steaks cooked?
WALT Medium, medium well?
TAO Funny.
TAO Walt pops open a beer and grabs an appetizer that Vu made.
WALT Is this Hmoog or Laab?
SUE Laab.
WALT Isn't it usually a little spicier?
WALT Tao, Wa Xam and Sue laugh.
SUE Oh whatever, Wally.
WALT It does.
WALT Usually it's got more zing.
SUE Jesus Christ, look at you.
SUE I've never seen you like this.
WALT What?
SUE Look at you smile, old man.
SUE Kicking back, having a good old time.
SUE You're sure pleased with yourself today.
TAO And it's a little unnerving if you ask me.
WALT Aw, go on.
SUE No, admit it.
SUE You are.
SUE You're feeling pretty good, aren't you?
WALT Well, who wouldn't?
WALT I'm surrounded by beautiful women, it's a beautiful day.
WALT Great food, good friends.
WALT Hell, even Toad isn't driving me nuts for once.
TAO It never ends.
WALT I'm just kidding.
WALT Let me tell you something, Yum-Yum.
WALT If Tao doesn't ask you out soon, I will.
SUE Don't listen to him, Wa Xam.
SUE He's a white devil.
WA XAM I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
WALT I'll be damned.
WALT Movie?
WALT Dinner?
WALT Wa Xam and Tao nod.
WALT They're a bit embarrassed.
SUE Yeah, they're taking the bus.
WALT The bus?!
WALT That's no good.
WALT A charming young lady like this deserves to go in style.
TAO Like what?
TAO Take a limo?
TAO Walt nods towards the GRAN TORINO.
TAO The Gran Torino?
TAO You'd let me drive it?
WALT Sure.
WALT Why not.
TAO Really?
TAO Walt smiles.
WALT Really.
WALT They shake hands.
89 Walt watches baseball.
89 He hears a car outside.
89 Shouts are heard and glass breaks.
89 Walt gets up and looks out the shades...
89 TAO'S HOUSE is raked with GUNFIRE coming from a VAN!
89 Windows shatter and the siding splinters.
89 FIFTY BULLETS shake the house before the VAN peels off.
90 Walt is up their front steps and in the house in seconds.
90 Walt goes from room to room, from Vu to Phong finally to Tao -- making sure no one's been hit.
WALT Is everyone okay?
WALT Is anyone hit?
WALT Sue?
WALT Vu?
WALT Tao, where's Tao?
WALT Tao sits up from behind the couch.
WALT Blood pours down his neck.
WALT He's stunned.
WALT Oh no.
WALT Walt lays Tao down and rips open the collar of his shirt.
WALT Walt probes around Tao's neck.
TAO What...
TAO what is it?
WALT Hang on...
WALT you're just cut, is all.
TAO Is everybody else okay?
WALT Yeah.
WALT Walt looks around at the BULLET HOLES in the walls.
WALT Tao follows his gaze.
TAO It's a miracle no one was killed.
WALT They aimed high.
WALT Sure enough -- most of the bullet holes are above head level on the walls.
WALT Where's Sue?
TAO She went to our aunt's.
WALT Call her.
TAO What?
WALT I said call her.
WALT Get the goddamned phone and call and see if she's there.
WALT Tao scrambles for the phone and dials.
WALT Tao speaks Hmong to whomever answered.
WALT Tao starts to speak faster.
WALT He looks at Walt and shakes his head ?no.? For once -- Vu and Phong understand what Walt was talking about.
WALT There is anguish on every face in the room.
91 Walt sits across from Tao, drinking rice liquor.
91 Walt speaks loudly, without any consideration for Phong who shoots him dirty looks.
WALT This is exactly what I didn't want.
WALT Damn gooks.
WALT Why the hell am I even here?
TAO Maybe one of her friends called and she just changed plans.
TAO Walt sips the rice liquor.
TAO Walt now speaks quietly to Tao.
WALT In Korea I learned not to care.
WALT The best friends of my life are still missing somewhere in Korea.
WALT You harden yourself.
WALT Don't let anything get to you.
WALT Phong looks out the window and screams.
WALT She runs over and swings open the door.
WALT Everyone expects the worst...
WALT And it comes like a cold wind -- SUE WALKS IN LIKE A ZOMBIE.
WALT She has been brutally beaten.
WALT Her clothes are dirty and torn.
WALT BLOOD runs down SUE'S legs from under her shirt.
WALT Walt looks at her and the glass falls from his hand.
WALT Sue staggers into Vu's arms.
WALT Vu weeps.
WALT Sue hugs her mother and sobs.
WALT Tao reaches to hug his sister, but Phong screeches at him, pointing at Walt and back to Tao.
WALT Walt is destroyed.
WALT He steps outside into the dark.
92 Walt staggers across the yard to his house.
WALT No, no, no, no, no.
PAGE 100 Walt bursts in the door, throws himself in an easy chair and CRIES.
PAGE 100 He tries to stop and cries harder.
PAGE 100 It's the first time Walt has cried in fifty years.
PAGE 100 He wails, crying for Tao, Sue, his wife, kids and himself.
PAGE 100 He lets it all out.
PAGE 100 Daisy jumps in his lap and he hugs his old dog as he bawls.
93 Walt sits, red-eyed.
93 He's done crying.
93 Family photo albums are scattered around.
93 Father Janovich knocks and eases open the front door.
FATHER JANOVICH Mr. Kowalski, are you in here?
WALT Come on in.
WALT Father Janovich comes in and sits down across from Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH Are you okay?
FATHER JANOVICH Walt nods.
FATHER JANOVICH The police finally left.
FATHER JANOVICH No one is talking.
FATHER JANOVICH One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
WALT I've noticed that.
WALT Father Janovich picks up a photo album and flips through it.
WALT Pictures of Mitch and Steve as babies.
WALT You know, there's no way that Tao or Sue are gonna have any peace if these gang guys don't go away.
WALT Go away forever.
WALT You know it as well as I do.
FATHER JANOVICH What are you saying?
WALT You heard what I said.
FATHER JANOVICH They took Sue to the hospital.
FATHER JANOVICH She's scared.
FATHER JANOVICH They're all scared.
WALT I'm not.
FATHER JANOVICH I know that.
FATHER JANOVICH Believe me, they all know that.
FATHER JANOVICH Tao especially.
FATHER JANOVICH He's sitting out there staring at your front door.
FATHER JANOVICH You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT Yeah, well what would you do if you were me?
WALT If you were Tao?
WALT What would you do?
WALT Father Janovich shakes his head.
FATHER JANOVICH I know what I'd do if I was you, or at least what you think you should do.
FATHER JANOVICH If I was Tao I guess I'd want vengeance.
FATHER JANOVICH I'd want to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
WALT And you?
FATHER JANOVICH What would I do?
FATHER JANOVICH I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.
FATHER JANOVICH I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.
FATHER JANOVICH Walt nods.
WALT Wanna beer?
FATHER JANOVICH I'd love one.
WALT They're in the cooler, grab me one too.
PAGE 102 Father Janovich grabs four beers, two for each of them.
PAGE 102 He opens a Pabst and takes a big swig.
FATHER JANOVICH Damn all this.
FATHER JANOVICH It just isn't fair.
WALT Nothing's fair, Father.
WALT Father Janovich and Walt sit for awhile.
FATHER JANOVICH So, what are you going to do, Mr.
FATHER JANOVICH Kowalski?
WALT Call me Walt.
WALT Father Janovich nods.
FATHER JANOVICH Alright, what are you going to do, Walt?
WALT Not sure yet.
WALT All I do know is they don't have a goddamned chance.
94 Walt sits at the kitchen table in his robe, drinking coffee.
94 Tao comes in without even knocking on the door.
TAO What are you doing?
WALT I'm thinking.
TAO Thinking time is over.
TAO Now it's time to knock the ass out of those pricks.
WALT I know you don't want to hear this, but you have to calm down.
TAO What?!
WALT You have to have a clear head, otherwise mistakes get made.
WALT Back away from what's happened, Tao.
TAO No.
TAO Don't let me down, Walt.
TAO Not you.
TAO This is going to end, today.
TAO Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit in.
WALT Sit down.
TAO I don't want to sit.
WALT I SAID SIT DOWN!
WALT Just listen up for a second and don't say anything.
WALT Tao sits down.
WALT Walt rubs his hands together.
WALT I know what needs to be done.
WALT I need to prepare, this needs to be carefully planned.
WALT You know I'm the right man for this.
WALT So cool down for a little while and meet me back here at 4 P.M. I promise you, what needs to be done, will be done.
TAO I say we go now.
TAO Right now.
WALT And do what?
WALT You want to go kill your cousin and those other Zips.
WALT Mr. Tough-Guy-All-Of-A-Sudden is out for blood.
WALT What do you even know about it?
WALT Tao is furious, but says nothing.
WALT Trust me, Tao.
WALT Cool down and we'll meet back here at four.
WALT Okay?
WALT Tao doesn't answer.
WALT I said ?okay?' You won't do anything without me.
WALT You meet me back here at four?
WALT Say ?okay.'
TAO Okay.
TAO Tao storms out the back door.
TAO Walt pours more coffee.
95 Walt soaks in the tub.
95 It's filled with bubbles.
95 Walt looks over at Daisy who rests on a towel in the corner.
95 Walt lights a CIGARETTE and exhales.
95 Daisy curls up her lips at the smoke.
WALT I know, I know.
WALT Give me a break, it's the first time I've ever smoked in the house.
96 Walt meticulously mows his lawn.
96 He carefully trims around the fence and birdbath.
97 Martin finishes cutting Walt's hair.
BARBER There, all done.
BARBER Ten bucks American.
WALT I don't suppose you still have steady enough hands to give a guy a straight shave, you withered, old Italian mummy?
BARBER You?
BARBER A straight shave?
BARBER You've never ordered a straight shave, ever.
WALT That's right.
WALT I always wondered what they were like.
WALT Unless you're too goddamned busy?
BARBER No, no.
BARBER That's fine.
BARBER Let me heat up a towel.
BARBER Walt hands Martin the Barber a twenty.
WALT Here's a twenty.
WALT Keep the change in case you slip and hit my jugular.
98 Walt gets fitted for a new suit.
98 The OLD TAILOR carefully measures Walt's shoulders.
WALT So you can take it in right here?
TAILOR Yes, sir.
TAILOR Take about an hour.
WALT That's great.
WALT Thank you.
TAILOR Yes, sir.
WALT Never had a fitted suit.
99 Walt comes in and Father Janovich looks up.
FATHER JANOVICH Mr. Kowalski, what can I do for you?
WALT I've come for confession.
FATHER JANOVICH Oh Lord Jesus, what have you done?
WALT Nothing.
WALT Take it easy.
FATHER JANOVICH What are you up to?
WALT Are you going to let me confess or not?
100 Walt calmly sits on one side and a very nervous, sweating Father Janovich sits on the other.
FATHER JANOVICH How long has it been since your last confession?
WALT Forever.
WALT Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
FATHER JANOVICH What are your sins, my son.
WALT In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the work Christmas party.
WALT Dorothy was talking with the other wives and it just happened.
FATHER JANOVICH Yes.
FATHER JANOVICH Go on.
WALT I made nine hundred dollars profit selling a boat and motor and never reported the taxes which is the same as stealing.
FATHER JANOVICH Yes.
FATHER JANOVICH Fine.
WALT And lastly, I was never close to my two sons.
WALT I don't know them.
WALT I didn't know how.
FATHER JANOVICH That's it?
WALT Whatta you mean, ?That's it?' It's bothered me for years.
FATHER JANOVICH God loves and forgives you.
FATHER JANOVICH Say ten ?Hail Marys' and five ?Our Fathers.' Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue?
FATHER JANOVICH Walt says nothing.
FATHER JANOVICH Father Janovich looks hard at Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT Is that so?
FATHER JANOVICH It is.
FATHER JANOVICH And every other day until you see the folly in what you are planning.
WALT I gotta go, Padre.
WALT Busy day ahead.
FATHER JANOVICH Go in peace.
WALT I am at peace.
WALT Walt and Father Janovich shake hands.
WALT Walt exits.
WALT Father Janovich exhales loudly and drops into his chair.
FATHER JANOVICH Je -- zuz -- Christ.
101 Walt carefully reassembles the two weapons he just cleaned and oiled.
101 Tao comes in and looks down at the two weapons -- The 30-06 M1 GARAND RIFLE and the COLT .45 PISTOL.
101 Tao picks up the heavy RIFLE.
TAO Which one do I get?
WALT You ever fire a weapon?
TAO No.
TAO Tao aims the rifle at an imaginary target.
WALT Put that down.
WALT I got something for you.
TAO What?
WALT In Korea, October, 1952.
WALT We were sent up to sweep a Chink machine gun nest that had carved us up pretty bad.
WALT I was the only one who came back...
WALT I received the Silver Star.
WALT I want you to have it.
TAO Why?
WALT When we went up that hill, we knew it was ten to one against us, but we went anyway.
WALT This trouble now, it's similar.
WALT We're walking right into it.
WALT We might not be coming home tonight.
TAO The hell we won't.
TAO We're going to roll in there and tear ass.
WALT Don't be a fool, these guys are waiting for that exact reaction.
WALT Tao is quiet for a minute.
TAO How many?
WALT How many what?
TAO How many men did you kill in Korea?
WALT Thirteen for sure.
WALT Probably more.
TAO What was it like to kill a man?
WALT You don't want to know.
TAO Why not?
WALT Go get the Silver Star.
WALT It's in a blue wooden box in the cellar.
WALT Tao goes downstairs.
WALT He turns on the light and goes into the cellar.
WALT Tao locates a BLUE WOODEN BOX and opens it.
WALT Tao holds up the MEDAL.
WALT He looks at it closely.
WALT AND WHAM -- Walt slams the heavy cellar DOOR shut behind him.
WALT Walt slides the BOLT LOCK into place with a loud
CLICK. Tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years.
CLICK. Of course he tries anyway.
CLICK. Tao is furious.
CLICK. He throws things.
TAO What the hell are you doing?!
TAO Let me out of here, you goddamned son- of-a-bitch!!
WALT Quit smashing everything.
WALT You'll never get out of there, so just relax.
TAO You let me out, you crazy old fuck, or I will kill you when I get out of here.
TAO Tao pounds on the door.
TAO Walt pounds back with a strength and authority which startles Tao.
WALT You want to know how it feels to kill a man?
WALT It feels goddamned lousy.
WALT And it feels even worse when you get a medal for bravery right after you mowed down some scared kid when he tries to give up.
WALT A dumb, scared, little gook, just about your age.
WALT I shot him with the same rifle you just held upstairs.
PAGE 110 I've thought about that kid for fifty years.
PAGE 110 And I promise you, boy, you want no part of it.
PAGE 110 Me, I've got blood on my hands.
PAGE 110 I'm soiled.
PAGE 110 Forgive me for tricking you like a dope.
PAGE 110 I'll call someone and have them let you out later.
TAO No!
TAO Let me out!!
TAO Tao pounds on the door.
WALT You've come a long way.
WALT I'm proud to call you a friend.
WALT You have your whole life ahead of you, whereas this is what I do.
WALT I finish things.
WALT You'd just get in the way.
WALT Sorry.
WALT Walt goes back upstairs, leaving Tao locked up in his cellar.
WALT Tao howls to be let out.
102 Walt walks out his front door with Daisy on her leash.
102 He walks over to Tao's house.
102 Phong sits in a lawnchair and glares at Walt.
102 She yells in Hmong as Walt walks straight up to her.
WALT Aw, pipe down, you hag.
PHONG You're an evil man.
PHONG I've seen your kind before.
PHONG Back home, white soldiers came to our villages and filled our young men's minds with ideas of glory.
PHONG Then you'd lead them away to their deaths.
PHONG Walt, of course, has no idea what she said.
WALT Fine, I hate you too.
PAGE 111 Walt holds out the DOG LEASH to Phong.
PAGE 111 She looks down at Daisy and back at Walt.
PAGE 111 She lashes out again in Hmong.
WALT I need you to watch my dog.
WALT Walt holds the leash closer.
WALT Phong folds her arms in defiance.
WALT Walt exhales loudly.
WALT Walt lifts up one of the LEGS OF HER LAWNCHAIR and slips the loop of the leash underneath it so Daisy can't follow him.
WALT Her name is Daisy.
WALT Walt bends down on one knee and lovingly pets Daisy.
WALT He scratches her belly.
WALT You take it easy, old gal.
WALT You good old girl.
WALT Walt gets up and walks away without looking back.
WALT Phong is stunned; she is silent for once.
103 Walt walks in and sits down.
103 He nods to the regulars.
WALT Good afternoon, gentlemen.
DARREL Walter, how are you doing?
WALTER Never been better.
BARTENDER Beer and a shot, Walt?
WALT I think I'll have something different.
WALT Walt looks at the liquor display.
WALT At the pinnacle of bottles sits a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.
WALT Think I'll try that Johnnie Walker Blue Label.
PAGE 112 The regulars all ?Oooooo? and ?Ahhhhhhh? at Walt's order.
MEL Whatta ya win the lottery, Wally?
WALT Naw, just having something special.
WALT Walt sips his Scotch and nods.
WALT It's good.
WALT Why don't you get all the guys the same.
BARTENDER You sure?
WALT I'm sure.
WALT This is too good not to be shared.
WALT Walt finishes his Scotch and points for one more.
WALT Several regulars hold up their drinks towards Walt.
104 Walt slips into the phone booth.
104 He puts in change and dials.
105 Sue weakly answers the phone next to her bed.
SUE Hello?
WALT (V.O.) It's Walt.
WALT (V.O.) The key to my front door is under the ceramic turtle.
WALT (V.O.) Open the door and go let your brother out of the cellar.
WALT (V.O.) I have to go.
WALT (V.O.) The line goes dead as Walt hangs up.
WALT (V.O.) Sue jumps up out of bed, pulls on some clothes and runs downstairs.
WALT (V.O.) Phong blocks her path.
WALT (V.O.) Phong grabs Sue by the arms.
PHONG Who was that?
PHONG Where are you going?
PHONG You tell me what's going on?!
PHONG Sue squirms away from Phong and runs outside.
PHONG On her way over to Walt's house, she sees Daisy leashed to Phong's chair.
PHONG It scares Sue even more.
106 Father Janovich paces back and forth.
106 The SQUAD CAR pulls up to him, which is exactly what he's been afraid of all day.
OFFICER Sorry, Father, we have to go.
FATHER JANOVICH I'm telling you.
FATHER JANOVICH If we're not here, there will be bloodshed.
OFFICER We've been here for hours.
OFFICER We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
FATHER JANOVICH I'm begging you to stay.
OFFICER I just got word from my Sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
FATHER JANOVICH I'm staying.
OFFICER No you aren't.
OFFICER My orders are specific.
OFFICER You came with us, you're leaving with us.
OFFICER Father Janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting into the SQUAD CAR.
OFFICER The SQUAD CAR drives off.
OFFICER Walt pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams the door.
OFFICER He looks at the duplex.
OFFICER It's a total eyesore.
WALT What a goddamned mess.
WALT You slopes should be ashamed of yourselves.
PAGE 114 Walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the duplex.
PAGE 114 Six very scared, very jittery Hmong gangbangers look out at Walt from various doorways and windows.
WALT Is that all you swamp rats or is there more vermin scurrying in the shadows?
WALT Smokie and Spider step out and stand on the porch.
WALT Smokie smiles at Walt.
WALT Walt spits on the ground.
SMOKIE I wasn't sure that you'd...
WALT Shut up, gook.
WALT I'm not here to listen to one goddamned syllable of what a shrimp-dicked little baby midget like you has to say.
WALT Spider pulls his PISTOL.
WALT That's right, boy.
WALT Defend your boyfriend after he or you or whoever rapes a member of your family.
WALT Your own blood, for Christ's sake.
WALT Go ahead, pull your pistols, just like a bunch of ridiculous miniature toy cowboys.
WALT Smokie and several other Hmong gangbangers pull their guns.
WALT You have no honor.
WALT You're the scum of the earth and when you're gone, do you think anyone will care?
WALT No one will mourn.
WALT You won't be missed.
WALT All the Hmong are spooked at Walt's absolute lack of fear.
SMOKIE Where's Tao, old man?
SMOKIE He too scared to come and stick up for himself?
WALT No.
WALT Tao is too good for this.
WALT You pukes aren't worth one second of his time.
WALT Walt slowly puts a CIGARETTE in his mouth.
WALT Even this slight movement has the gangbangers waving their PISTOLS around.
WALT Walt laughs.
WALT You boys are a little bit jumpy.
SPIDER You watch it, old man.
WALT No, I think you'd better watch it.
WALT Walt looks around.
WALT Other than the gangbangers, a small group of people have gathered to watch this showdown.
107 Sue opens the front door, runs to the stairwell and pounds down the stairs.
SUE Tao?
SUE Tao, are you alright?
I'M DOWN HERE! LET ME OUT!! She unlocks the CELLAR DOOR.
I'M DOWN HERE! LET ME OUT!! Tao comes out in a rage.
TAO Goddamn it!
SUE What's going on?
TAO He left without me!
SUE Where?
SUE Where'd he go?!
TAO He went to Smokie's without me.
TAO Tao takes the stairs two steps at a time.
SUE No!
SUE No, Tao!
SUE Sue grabs Tao's legs and hangs on.
SUE No!
SUE Don't you dare!
SUE Stay away from them, Tao!
SUE I don't want anyone else getting hurt.
TAO Leave me alone.
NO, TAO. NO! They struggle at the top of the stairs and spill into the kitchen floor.
NO, TAO. NO! Tao runs for the door when something catches his eye...
NO, TAO. NO! The kitchen table.
NO, TAO. NO! The RIFLE and PISTOL are still there.
NO, TAO. NO! Walt purposely left the guns at home.
TAO Oh God!
TAO NO!!
WALT Anybody got a light?
WALT No?
WALT I got one.
WALT Walt's slight grin fades.
WALT He mutters to himself...
WALT Hail Mary, full of grace.
WALT Walt reaches into his coat pocket.
WALT Six Hmong gangbangers simultaneously level their PISTOLS and FIRE.
WALT BULLETS FLY.
WALT Walt is struck down.
WALT People scream.
WALT Walt falls dead.
WALT A ZIPPO lighter clutched in his hand.
WALT Walt never intended to kill anyone.
WALT Self-sacrifice.
109 Tao and Sue arrive just as Smokie, Spider and company are being driven away in Police cars.
109 Tao looks at Smokie in the squad car.
109 Smokie no longer looks tough or hard, he just looks scared.
109 On the street, Walt is being bagged by the ambulance crew.
109 Father Janovich prays over him.
109 Tao steps up to a POLICE OFFICER.
TAO What happened?
POLICE OFFICER You have to step back.
TAO He was a friend of mine.
POLICE OFFICER I said step back.
POLICE OFFICER Tao turns to the HMONG POLICE OFFICER.
TAO What happened, man?
TAO The Hmong Police Officer looks at the WHITE POLICE OFFICER and then to Tao.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER You heard him, step back.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER Tao speaks to the HMONG OFFICER in their native language.
TAO Please, man, it's important.
TAO He's my friend.
TAO Tell me what happened?
HMONG POLICE OFFICER The old guy reaches for a lighter and they gunned him down.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER The gang said the old guy was here to kill them, but he didn't have a weapon.
TAO What's going to happen?
HMONG POLICE OFFICER We actually have witnesses for once.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER These guys are going away big time.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER The WHITE OFFICER yells at the HMONG OFFICER.
POLICE OFFICER Officer Chang, get those people back.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER Yes, sir.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER You have to step back now.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER Tao hugs his sister.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER Sue openly weeps.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER Tao holds it in.
HMONG POLICE OFFICER He looks at his friend Walt as the bag is zipped over him.
110 Tao and Sue wait in front.
110 Tao wears a suit, Sue is in a traditional Hmong dress.
110 A TAXI pulls up and they get in.
110 Sitting on the porch is Phong who rocks back and forth in her rocking chair.
110 Phong holds Daisy in her arms, gently petting the old dog.
111 We're at the funeral of Walter Kowalski.
111 Walt is dressed in his new suit.
111 Along with the crowd you'd expect, Tao and Sue are seated near the front.
111 Walt's sons and family are there.
111 Mitch gives Tao a dirty look.
111 Tao looks back at him, his gaze bores right through Mitch.
111 Mitch looks away.
111 Father Janovich steps up to the pulpit and speaks.
FATHER JANOVICH Walt Kowalski once said to me I didn't know anything about life or death because ?I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.' Walt definitely had no problem ?calling it like he saw it.' But Walt was right.
FATHER JANOVICH I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH And boy, did I learn.
112 All of Walt's family are seated in an office as a LAWYER reads Walt Kowalski's will.
112 Tao is present along with Walt's family.
LAWYER Which brings us to our last item.
LAWYER And again, please forgive the language used in Mr. Kowalski's will.
LAWYER I'm simply reading it as it was written.
LAWYER The LAWYER takes a sip of water before reading...
LAWYER ?And to my friend, Tao Vang Lor, I leave my 1972 Gran Torino on the condition that you don't choptop the roof like a damned spick, don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big gay spoiler on the rear-end like you see on all the other zipper heads' cars.
LAWYER It just looks like hell.
LAWYER If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours.
