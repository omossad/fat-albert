SEX AND THE CITY THE MOVIE
Written by
Michael Patrick King
Glistening city buildings reflect onto the WINDOW of an upscale clothing boutique.
In the window -- a MANNEQUIN is wearing -- the best of everything.
A PRETTY TWENTY-SOMETHING girl looks in at the display: dreaming of the day.
CARRIE (V.O.) Year after year, twenty-something women come to New York City in search of the two "L's": labels and love.
Four TWENTY-SOMETHING WOMEN walk away from us -- arms linked LAUGHING -- They make their way down the busy street -- shopping bags and designer purses swinging.
The young women reveal:
CARRIE BRADSHAW (41) and fabulous -- walking towards us.
She watches them as they pass, a SMILE grows on her face.
CARRIE (V.O.) Twenty years ago...
CARRIE (V.O.) I was one of them.
She walks along, her shopping bag -- swinging.
Carrie on step ladder, barefoot.
Her finger moves along a series of DESIGNER shoe boxes...
CARRIE (V.O.) Having gotten the knack for labels early...
CARRIE (V.O.) I concentrated on my search for love.
Summer night.
Couples everywhere.
Carrie walks along.
CARRIE (V.O.) Turns out, a "knock-off" is not as easy to spot when comes to love...
She passes a twenty-something girl and guy huddled very close together.
Suddenly, the girl SLAPS HIM across the face.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Until it is.
CARRIE reacts, and trots along.
CARRIE and preppy perfect CHARLOTTE walk along, talking.
CARRIE (V.O.) That is why you need help to spot them...
JUMP CUT TO: Carrie, Charlotte and MIRANDA walk along talking.
CARRIE (CONT'D) ...
CARRIE (CONT'D) Lots of help.
JUMP CUT TO: Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and SAMANTHA walk along; LAUGHING -- their shopping bags and designer purses swinging.
The front of Carrie's building.
She is typing in her window.
Carrie at her desk - typing.
CLOSE ON the computer screen -- Written on it: "Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha..."
CARRIE (V.O.) Year after year, my single girlfriends were my salvation.
CARRIE (V.O.) And, as it turns out...
CLOSE ON: A colorful CHICK LIT book cover: "A Single Life" by Carrie Bradshaw.
CARRIE (V.O.) ...
CARRIE (V.O.) My meal ticket.
CARRIE -- standing on her bed placing it next to her TWO other books: "Sex and The City" and "Menhattan"
A framed photo of four girls (circa 1999) is also on the shelf.
She picks it up -- Touches it sweetly.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) We still are those four single girls...
CARRIE in a sexy, summer dress, spots someone -- waves --
CARRIE (V.O.) Even though, technically...
CARRIE (V.O.) we're not.
She hurries across the street to meet that SOMEONE...
MIRANDA (41) and BRADY (5) are filling an inflatable pool with water from a hose.
As STEVE approaches with Popsicles, they squirt him with the hose.
He grabs them; laughing.
CARRIE (V.O) One of us is married...
Charlotte (40) and HARRY and their beautiful Asian daughter LILY (3) go around.
Lily giggles, they kvell.
CARRIE (V.O) One of us...
CARRIE (V.O) married, divorced and re-married...
The deck of fabulous Malibu beachouse.
Samantha (49) sits near the pool wearing a white bikini and huge white sunglasses making deals on the phone as SMITH lays nearby in a bathing suit -- reading a script.
CARRIE (V.O) One of us...
CARRIE (V.O) relocated.
Carrie walks over and into the arms of that SOMEONE -- it's MR.
BIG -- waiting for her in front of an apartment building.
CARRIE (V.O.) And...
CARRIE (V.O.) one of us stayed exactly where she was.
They kiss.
A good kiss.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) In love.
A kiss worth waiting four years to see.
They turn and start into the classic apartment building.
The doorman tips his hat and opens the door.
Carrie and Big walk through the beautiful lobby and over to the elevator...
holding hands.
BIG I got a good feeling about this one, kid.
CARRIE I've always loved this block.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Finding the perfect apartment in New York City is like finding the perfect partner.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) It can take years.
They push the elevator button.
Doors open.
They step on.
BIG How many does this make?
CARRIE This is thirty-three.
BIG Lucky thirty-three!
They laugh a little as the doors close on the elevator.
A door is opened up by CAROL (55) their real estate agent.
CAROL The worst.
CAROL I just left you a message.
Carrie and Big look in.
The apartment is dark, claustrophobic -- awful.
A male BUILDING AGENT (40) stands here.
The smiles leave Carrie and Big's faces.
CARRIE Thirty-four.
CARRIE Lucky thirty-four?
Big looks over at her.
She shrugs.
The Building Agent holds the elevator doors open for Carrie, Big and Carol as they get on.
CARRIE If anything else opens up let us know.
CARRIE We're very interested in this building.
AGENT I do have another apartment that's not even on the market yet.
AGENT Care to take a look?
CARRIE/BIG Sure.
AGENT It's more than you were looking to pay.
CAROL How much more?
AGENT More.
The Agent reaches over and presses the "PH" button on the control panel.
Carrie and Big react.
A gorgeous pre-war penthouse apartment.
Empty except for the beautiful light.
Old-world New York City style.
Elevator doors open into the penthouse foyer.
Carrie and Big step in.
BIG Oh, so this is where they keep the light.
CARRIE Oh my God.
CARRIE I've died and gone to real estate heaven.
CARRIE Look at this place.
She swirls around to Big -- very grand dame; with accent.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Hellooo, I live here.
Carrie starts giggling.
Big looks over to the agents.
BIG Must be the altitude.
Big smiles.
Carrie laughs as the Agent walks on.
AGENT And across the rooftop terrace ---
CARRIE What -- Nirvana?
AGENT Your wife has quite a sense of humor.
CAROL They're not married.
CARRIE No, he's my boyfriend.
AGENT This way.
The agent and Carol start out across the terrace.
Big and Carrie follow lagging a little behind.
BIG Aren't I a little old to be introduced as your boyfriend?
CARRIE Point taken.
CARRIE From now on...
CARRIE you'll be my man friend.
BIG Sounds like a dog.
CARRIE Well, if the shoe fits.
She gives him a look.
He swats her ass, gently as they go.
Carrie and Big lead the way into the bedroom.
Big windows, high ceilings.
Beautiful light as well.
AGENT And this is the master bedroom.
CARRIE Hideous.
CARRIE Hate it.
CARRIE Hurts my eyes.
Big laughs, Carrie walks around taking it in.
CARRIE (CONT'D) How is this place even available?
AGENT Nasty divorce.
CARRIE If you live here what is there to fight about?
Carrie opens the closet door.
It is very small.
CARRIE (CONT'D) This is the master closet?
CARRIE (CONT'D) No.
AGENT Yes.
AGENT Small for a room this size.
AGENT I know.
CARRIE Hmmm.
CARRIE Hmmm.
CARRIE Now, I understand the divorce.
BIG I can build you a better closet.
Carrie looks at him; aghast.
He smiles.
BIG (CONT'D) Welcome home, baby.
CARRIE Can we afford this?
BIG I got it.
Carrie screams with joy and shock.
He laughs, thrilled.
Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte walk down the street.
CARRIE "I got it."
CARRIE Just like that.
CARRIE "I got it" -- like he was picking up the check for coffee or something.
CHARLOTTE It sounds perfect.
CARRIE Except for the closet which Big says he can redo -- also he says the kitchen needs work but I don't know about that `cause I keep sweaters in my stove.
Carrie and Charlotte laugh.
MIRANDA So, he bought it -- and you're going to live there with him?
CARRIE Yes, together.
CARRIE That's right.
MIRANDA But he'll own it.
MIRANDA So.
MIRANDA You are keeping your own place, right?
CARRIE Oh, Miranda, please, I haven't figured out all the details yet, but I'm a smart girl and I'm sure I'll figure out something I'm comfortable with.
MIRANDA I just want to make sure you're being smart here --
CARRIE And I love you for it -- but for now can't you stop worrying for me and just go ahead and feel what I want you to feel.
CARRIE Jealous.
Miranda smiles.
Carrie puts her arm around her.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Jealous of me living in this gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.
MIRANDA Fine.
MIRANDA I'm jealous.
MIRANDA You're in real estate heaven and I'm in Brooklyn.
CHARLOTTE New York magazine said Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.
MIRANDA Whoever wrote that - lives in Brooklyn.
CARRIE There she is.
CARRIE Hey Hollywood!
Samantha is standing out in front of Christies.
She waves to them -- as she finishes a call.
SAMANTHA Samantha Jones...
SAMANTHA Smith Jerrod's manager -- I'm in New York `till Monday.
She hangs up; as they reach her.
CARRIE (CONT'D) How was your flight?
SAMANTHA Fabulous.
SAMANTHA Let's go in -- I am so excited!
A lobby bustling with NEW YORK WOMEN.
All types.
Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda make their way through them.
CARRIE (V.O.) It was a rare occasion that brought all types of women together.
CARRIE (V.O.) The socialites, the trendies the yuppies, the yentas.
The girls gently move past by an elderly YENTA, who reacts.
YENTA Why the pushing?
Carrie and the girls enter a room filled with dramatically lit jewelry cases that display amazing jewelry.
On the walls around the gallery are large photos of a BEAUTIFUL RAVEN HAIRED WOMAN (45).
She is captured in candid poses "out and about" New York city at various social events wearing the jewelry on display.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Blair Elkenn was a waitress turned model turned actress turned billionaire's girlfriend who came home one night to find herself unceremoniously turned out on the street.
Samantha, Carrie and Charlotte page through the catalogues as they walk.
Miranda types on her Blackberry.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And now she was getting the ultimate break-up revenge.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) An embarrassing and very public auction of all the jewelry he had given her when they were happy.
The girls stop.
Floating in a case at their eye level is a unique, "two finger" FLOWER RING made out of diamonds.
SAMANTHA There it is.
SAMANTHA My baby.
CARRIE/BIG And she's a beauty.
SAMANTHA When I saw this in the catalogue I said to Smith: This flower ring is the essence of me.
SAMANTHA One of a kind, filled with fire...
CARRIE And a little too much.
SAMANTHA Exactly.
SAMANTHA Come on.
SAMANTHA Let's go spend some of my hard-earned Hollywood money.
They make their way to the auction room.
MIRANDA Hey -- what's coming up on Smith's series?
MIRANDA Is he going to sleep with that new blonde neurosurgeon?
SAMANTHA He sleeps with every hot woman doctor in that hospital.
MIRANDA Great.
MIRANDA Can't wait.
CHARLOTTE Don't you ever get weirded out by seeing Smith in bed with all those other women?
SAMANTHA No, I think it's hot.
SAMANTHA Sometimes, when I'm alone, I masturbate right along with them.
CARRIE And people say the golden age of television is over.
SAMANTHA Besides, it's fake sex.
SAMANTHA When they're doing it -- no one's actually turned on.
MIRANDA Kinda like Steve and I.
Miranda laughs.
Everyone looks.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) I'm kidding.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) But come one-- it's been seven years.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) He does that, I do this...
MIRANDA (CONT'D) It's not like a new plot twist is going to turn up.
A DISTINGUISHED WOMAN AUCTIONEER is at a podium.
AUCTIONEER Next item.
AUCTIONEER The flower ring.
Samantha sits up, ready.
An electric buzz moves through the crowd.
CARRIE (V.O.) If Schadenfreude is the word for feeling pleasure at someone else misfortune -- This was "jewelryfreude."
AUCTIONEER Let's start the bidding at ten thousand.
Samantha raises her number.
The Auctioneer nods.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Thank you madame.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Do I hear fifteen?
A WOMAN IN A BUSINESS SUIT (40) on a phone, raises her number.
Samantha looks over at her.
SAMANTHA Bitch.
CARRIE And the gloves are off.
AUCTIONEER Do I hear twenty?
Samantha raises her number.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Twenty.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Do I hear twenty-five?
The Woman raises her number.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Twenty-five.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Thirty?
Samantha raises her number.
Carrie's eyes widen.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Thirty-five?
The Woman is talking with someone on the phone.
MIRANDA She's bidding for someone on the phone.
CHARLOTTE That's not fair.
The Woman raises her hand.
Charlotte gives her a look.
AUCTIONEER Thirty-five.
AUCTIONEER Forty?
SAMANTHA I deserve this.
SAMANTHA I work hard.
AUCTIONEER Do I hear forty?
Samantha raises her hand.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Do I hear forty fi--
The Woman quickly raises her hand.
Auctioneer nods.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Fifty?
SAMANTHA Sex with only one man for I don't know how long.
AUCTIONEER Do I hear fifty thousand?
SAMANTHA Fifty fucking thousand!
A LAUGH ripples through the room.
Samantha glares at the rival woman, almost daring her.
Carrie looks afraid.
AUCTIONEER Fifty-five?
The Woman raises her hand.
Samantha reacts disappointed.
The Auctioneer looks at Samantha.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Sixty?
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Sixty to our colorful bidder?
SAMANTHA I draw the line at fifty.
Samantha shakes her head no.
Carrie rubs her arm.
Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte are primping in front of the mirror.
CHARLOTTE I thought this auction would be more fun...
CHARLOTTE but it's kinda sad.
A BABY VOICED WOMAN (45) next to Charlotte overhears.
BABY VOICED WOMAN Isn't it?
They look over at her.
BABY VOICED WOMAN (CONT'D) I thought it was just sad for me `cause I know her.
BABY VOICED WOMAN (CONT'D) But it's really sad, huh?
BABY VOICED WOMAN (CONT'D) And it's funny cause they were so happy.
SAMANTHA ...
SAMANTHA Till they weren't
BABY VOICED WOMAN I know, right?
BABY VOICED WOMAN We all told her to get married -- but she didn't want to push him.
BABY VOICED WOMAN He'd been married three other times.
BABY VOICED WOMAN So, she let it ride and then she came home one night and he had locked her out.
BABY VOICED WOMAN She didn't even have anywhere to live.
BABY VOICED WOMAN After ten years.
BABY VOICED WOMAN Such a shame.
BABY VOICED WOMAN She was a smart girl till she fell in love.
Carrie catches Miranda's eye in the mirror, looks away.
Big takes a bright red lobster out of a pot of hot water with tongs.
He places it next to another cooked lobster.
He walks to the cooking island where Carrie sits; sipping wine.
BIG The creatures are ready.
BIG Just gonna sit there?
CARRIE I'm not sitting, I'm thinking.
BIG Here.
BIG Husk and think.
He winks -- puts two ears of corn in front of her, then starts chopping tomatoes.
CARRIE I'm thinking I'm going to sell my apartment and put the money towards heaven on Fifth.
BIG Why?
BIG You love your place.
CARRIE I know but --
BIG But what?
CARRIE We're together ever night -- so I'm basically paying a mortgage on a glorified closet.
BIG You write there.
BIG It's your office.
CARRIE There's plenty of room at the new place and -- besides..
CARRIE I want to make us -- a life there.
CARRIE I want it to be ours.
BIG It is ours.
BIG I bought it for us.
CARRIE And that's so amazing --but you bought it, so it's really your place.
CARRIE And -- if anything were to happen...
BIG What's going to happen?
CARRIE I have to be smart here.
CARRIE I mean, we're not married and I'd have no legal rights to...
CARRIE this home that I built...
CARRIE with you.
Silence.
He thinks.
Chops.
She husks.
BIG Did you want to get married?
CARRIE I didn't think it was an option.
BIG Well, Mr. Bradshaw, what if it was an option?
She hits him with a husk.
He smiles.
CARRIE Well, people are always assuming we are.
BIG And you know what happens when people assume.
BIG They make an ass out of who?
CARRIE You and me.
He smiles.
She smiles.
Chop.
Chop.
BIG What do you think, kid?
CARRIE Why -- Do you want to get married?
BIG Well, I wouldn't mind be married to you.
BIG Would you mind being married to me?
CARRIE No, if that's what you want.
CARRIE Is that what you want?
BIG I want you.
BIG So.
BIG Okay.
CARRIE Okay.
CARRIE Really?
CARRIE We're getting married.
BIG We're getting married.
BIG Should we get you a diamond?
CARRIE No, please, don't get me a diamond.
CARRIE Get me a really big closet.
BIG Deal.
He puts out his hand.
She takes it and they shake.
BIG (CONT'D) But...
BIG (CONT'D) You gotta do better on that corn.
BIG (CONT'D) Look at all the stuff left on there.
She looks down at her corn, he's right.
She nods.
Crowded; serious lunch crowd.
Carrie sits across from Charlotte and Miranda.
Miranda is in a work suit.
CARRIE So, the other night, Big and I were talking about, you know, moving in together and our future...
Charlotte's eyes are getting wider and wider.
CARRIE (CONT'D) ...
CARRIE (CONT'D) And about what makes sense as we move forward.
CARRIE (CONT'D) And, well...
CARRIE (CONT'D) we decided to get married.
Charlottes SCREAMS at the top of her lungs.
Carrie and Miranda and the ENTIRE RESTAURANT REACT.
MIRANDA ...
MIRANDA and I'm deaf.
CARRIE Everyone's looking
Charlotte looks around at the DISGRUNTLED FACES.
She half- stands and address the DINERS looking at her.
CHARLOTTE Sorry!
CHARLOTTE I'm sorry...
CHARLOTTE but my friend here, just got engaged and she's been going out with the man for ten years.
The DINERS bursts into APPLAUSE.
Carrie slumps in her chair, pulls up her sweater collar, turns to Miranda.
CARRIE I am mortified.
MIRANDA There is literally a ringing in my ear.
A large PHOTO of Smith.
Samantha walks past it and up a sleek, modern office building stairway.
Her cell rings.
SAMANTHA Samantha Jones--
Intercut with Carrie walking through the upscale boutique talking on her pink Swarovski crystal-covered cell phone.
CARRIE Well...
CARRIE I made a little decision that I hope you'll be happy about.
SAMANTHA Oh, honey...
SAMANTHA you finally got Botox.
CARRIE No.
CARRIE I did not get Botox
SAMANTHA I'm telling you, Carrie -- you'll love it.
CARRIE I did not call to talk about Botox.
SAMANTHA I'm just saying.
Samantha reaches the top of the stairs.
Blow-ups of Smith on various magazine covers line the walls of the chic, small office space.
CARRIE So...
CARRIE Last week, after the auction, I started thinking about my options.
SAMANTHA Right.
CARRIE Right, and...
CARRIE well, Big and I decided to get married.
SAMANTHA Really?
CARRIE Yes.
SAMANTHA That's great.
CARRIE You sounded more excited about the botox.
SAMANTHA Well, honey -- I am excited for you but -- you know me...
SAMANTHA I don't really believe in marriage....
SAMANTHA Botox on the other hand -- That works every time.
A RECEPTIONIST (23) hands her some messages.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Honey, I've got to go.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) The People magazine person is on hold.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Smith's on the short list to be their "Sexiest Man Alive."
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) We can catch up when I'm in town next week.
Samantha hangs up.
Carrie looks at her phone: dismissed and disappointed.
She closes it and walks on.
Carrie rounds a corner.
Her phone rings.
CARRIE Hello?
Intercut with Samantha standing in her office.
SAMANTHA I think I was in shock.
SAMANTHA I mean, it's you getting married.
SAMANTHA This is not some random person -- it's you.
CARRIE I hear ya.
SAMANTHA And I guess, I thought that after that big mess with Aidan -- you'd never want to get married.
CARRIE I know.
SAMANTHA So, I put you in my "we're never getting married" file.
SAMANTHA Now, I've got to take you out of that file.
CARRIE Sorry about the extra paper work.
SAMANTHA You'll get my bill.
CARRIE Samantha, it feels so different this time.
CARRIE No cliche romantic kneeling down on one knee.
CARRIE Just you know, two grown-ups -- making a decision about spending their lives together.
SAMANTHA Well, I'm happy for you.
CARRIE And one more thing...
CARRIE I want you to be maid of honor.
CARRIE How do you feel about that?
SAMANTHA The same way you feel about Botox.
SAMANTHA Painful and unnecessary.
Carrie laughs.
Samantha shrugs.
Carrie and Charlotte sit on her bed looking through a list of names.
ANTHONY sits at her makeup vanity.
He has a large notebook open in front of him.
CHARLOTTE 74, 75, 76....
CHARLOTTE Seventy-six guests.
ANTHONY Seventy five sounds better.
ANTHONY "A small, wedding of seventy five guests."
Carrie looks at the list.
CARRIE (V.O.) As a wedding gift, Charlotte had given me Anthony Marantino -- friend and wedding planner.
Carrie crosses someone off.
Charlotte reacts, shocked.
CARRIE (CONT'D) What?
CARRIE (CONT'D) She was borderline anyway.
ANTHONY Cut throat -- I love it.
ANTHONY I hope you're that decisive when it comes to the location and the dress.
CARRIE Oh.
CARRIE I found the dress.
CHARLOTTE What?!
CHARLOTTE When?
CARRIE The other day.
CARRIE I have it here.
Carrie gets up and goes into the closet.
Anthony hurries over and sits next to Charlotte.
ANTHONY This is going to be good!
CHARLOTTE I'm so excited!
CARRIE (V.O.) Here it is.
Anthony and Charlotte grab hands in anticipation as Carrie comes out of her closet.
She holds up a simple OFF-WHITE VINTAGE SUIT.
Charlotte and Anthony deflate.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Well...
CARRIE (CONT'D) that was the exact reaction I was aiming for.
CHARLOTTE No, it's pretty but it's so -- simple.
CARRIE Simple and classic.
CARRIE When I saw it I just thought: That is what I should marry Big in.
ANTHONY Well, who's it by?
ANTHONY The label?
CARRIE No one.
CARRIE I found it in a vintage shop.
ANTHONY "The bride wore a dress by no one."
She turns and heads back into the closet.
CARRIE Don't worry, I'll style it up with shoes.
Anthony turns to Charlotte and says in a low voice.
ANTHONY The invitation is fancier than the dress.
CARRIE (O.C.) I heard that.
A "family style" Italian restaurant.
Miranda, in business clothes, sits with Steve, Brady and MAGDA.
Brady's face is covered in spaghetti sauce.
CARRIE (V.O.) And from Anthony Marantino to spaghetti marinara.
MIRANDA Where is he with the check?
STEVE Geese, Miranda -- relax.
STEVE Magda's not even finished yet.
MIRANDA I still have a legal brief to work on when I get home.
BRADY I have to go to the bathroom.
MAGDA I'll take him.
MAGDA Wash that beautiful face too, yes?
Brady nods.
Magda walks away with Brady.
Miranda is packing up Brady's action figures.
Steve gives her a look.
MIRANDA What?
MIRANDA I'm sorry.
MIRANDA I'm exhausted.
MIRANDA Brady woke me up at five AM.
STEVE He woke me up too.
Silence.
She sips her cappuccino.
Foam covers her top lip.
He looks over at her and smiles.
STEVE (CONT'D) You got milk on your top lip.
She licks it off, not pleased.
STEVE (CONT'D) What now?
MIRANDA It's like you're always criticizing me.
STEVE I am not.
STEVE You want to go through life with foam on your lip and no one telling you?
Silence.
He reaches down and picks up her coffee cup and sips...
putting lots of foam on his lip.
He looks over.
STEVE (CONT'D) Anything you want to tell me?
She shakes her head: No.
He puts his face in front of hers.
She laughs.
He licks his lip.
Steve is in bed with Miranda, they are making love.
She is wearing a T-shirt.
MIRANDA Yeah.
MIRANDA Yeah.
STEVE Wait --- wait -- Don't come already...
MIRANDA Yeah.
MIRANDA Yeah.
STEVE Wait, wait -- get on top.
STEVE Get on --
MIRANDA It's late...
MIRANDA let's just get it over with.
Steve looks at her.
She can't believe what she's said.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) I mean -- We have to get up in four and half hours.
STEVE We never have sex and you want to get it over with?
MIRANDA Steve...
MIRANDA We have sex.
STEVE When was the last time we had sex?
Miranda can't remember.
He moves to his side of the bed.
STEVE (CONT'D) There was snow on the ground.
He gets out of the bed and walks away.
She watches him go.
The girls are having breakfast.
Lily sits at the table in a booster seat coloring in a Cinderella coloring book.
Carrie is helping her.
CLOSE ON: Cinderella's shoe.
Carrie is filling it in with a BLUE CRAYON.
MIRANDA How often do you guys have sex?
CHARLOTTE Miranda -- please.
MIRANDA What?
She indicates that Lily is sitting with Carrie.
Carrie continues to color, not looking up.
CARRIE It's okay, I know all about sex.
SAMANTHA If I knew the girl talk was going to be on "lock down," I wouldn't have flown two thousand miles.
CHARLOTTE No, we can talk, let's just not use that word.
MIRANDA She's three, she doesn't know what it means.
MIRANDA I'm forty- two and I still don't know what it means.
CHARLOTTE I know, but she's repeating everything.
MIRANDA Fine.
MIRANDA How often do you guys...
CARRIE ...
CARRIE "Color"?
CHARLOTTE Thank-you.
SAMANTHA Well, I can't color enough.
SAMANTHA I would color all day -- every day if I had my way.
SAMANTHA I'd use every crayon in my box.
CARRIE We get it.
CARRIE You love to color.
CARRIE Why are you asking?
MIRANDA Steve and I were "coloring" last night and just as I was about to --
Miranda is searching for a word she can use.
SAMANTHA Come?
SAMANTHA Sorry -- there is no crayon equivalent.
MIRANDA He wanted to change positions and I said...
MIRANDA "Let's just get it over with."
The ladies react, three different shades of shocked.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Well, he kept trying to make it last longer.
SAMANTHA And this is bad?
MIRANDA It is when you have a full-time job.
SAMANTHA I have a full-time job.
MIRANDA Well, you don't also have a five year old and play groups and PTA and a mother-in-law in a rest home with advancing Alzheimer's.
MIRANDA I'm telling you, at the end of the day all I want to do is sleep.
MIRANDA The most exciting thing in bed now -- is the bed.
CARRIE So...
CARRIE Sleep is the new sex?
LILY Sex.
CHARLOTTE See.
CARRIE -- I meant coloring.
MIRANDA We're just going through a no coloring phase -- it comes and goes, right?
CHARLOTTE Every couple is different.
CHARLOTTE Harry and I --
Carrie and Samantha look over; interested.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) ...
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Make love two or three times a week.
MIRANDA Great.
MIRANDA Now I feel worse.
SAMANTHA Well, when was the last time for you?
MIRANDA Six months ago.
CARRIE Oh my.
CARRIE Miranda looks at her.
CARRIE She -- continues to color.
MIRANDA But that's a dry spell.
SAMANTHA I bet it is.
CHARLOTTE What about you and Big, Carrie?
CHARLOTTE Come on, I told.
CARRIE Never.
CARRIE But, I will tell you this.
CARRIE When Big colors --
CARRIE He rarely stays inside the lines.
CARRIE Samantha whoops.
CARRIE Carrie resumes coloring.
MIRANDA Well, this was very helpful.
A freshly-showered Samantha sits on a chaise lounge in a robe -- talking on the phone.
SAMANTHA Send it to Smith Jerrod at the office address.
SAMANTHA Smith walks up to Samantha wearing only underwear.
SAMANTHA There is a huge bulge in the front.
SAMANTHA Samantha takes the bulge in.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) I've got to go.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Something just came up.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) She hangs up.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) He smiles, looks down at her.
SMITH I've got a gift for you.
SAMANTHA So far, I like it.
He smiles as she reaches INTO his underwear basket and removes a long black velvet jewelry case.
She opens it.
It's the petal ring from the auction.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) How did -- Wait -- that was you on the phone at the auction?
SMITH I knew how much you wanted it.
SAMANTHA But I was going to buy it for myself.
SMITH I wanted to give it to you...
SMITH for our anniversary.
SMITH We met five years ago today.
SAMANTHA Right.
He smiles, sits down on the bed.
SMITH Do you like it?
SAMANTHA To be clear -- This is a ring with diamonds -- not a diamond ring, right?
SAMANTHA In that case...
SAMANTHA I love it.
SAMANTHA It's my second favorite thing I've ever found in there.
She kisses him, touched -- then reaches in his underwear.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Now, my gift's a little bit more...
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) oral.
SMITH Babe -- I've got to go to bed.
SAMANTHA Bed?
SAMANTHA It's seven-thirty.
SMITH I have to be at the studio by six A.M.
SMITH and I need to get a workout before that.
SAMANTHA This is how it starts.
SAMANTHA Next thing you know...
SAMANTHA we're only having sex three or four times a week.
SMITH Most people consider that normal.
SAMANTHA I am not most people.
SMITH No - you most certainly are not.
SMITH He smiles, leans in and gives her a hot -- hot kiss.
SMITH The kiss leads -- to reaching into underwear...
SMITH as they start.
Smith is laying in bed.
Sound asleep.
The clock on the bed table reads: 9:01.
Night.
Samantha sits in the jacuzzi wearing her ring -- sipping a glass of wine -- bored.
CARRIE (V.O.) One glass of Merlot and two orgasms later.
CARRIE (V.O.) Samantha hears MOANING.
CARRIE (V.O.) The sounds of someone having SEX in the house right next door.
CARRIE (V.O.) She looks -- from the hot tub she can see her neighbor DANTE -- hot, dark -- "sex on a stick" in his living room making wild love to a RED HAIRED WOMAN.
CARRIE (V.O.) They are naked.
CARRIE (V.O.) Samantha watches and sips -- not so bored.
CARRIE (CONT'D) And that is how Samantha learned she had a new neighbor.
Carrie enters the apartment.
It is dark-ish.
A candle or two is lit.
CARRIE John?
CARRIE The terrace doors are open.
CARRIE The curtains blow, gently.
CARRIE She walks out onto it.
As she steps out onto the terrace.
Big comes up behind her.
He -- leans her against the door jamb and kisses her.
It's hot.
He kisses her -- sliding down the front of her body.
Big is in bed wearing "half glasses," reading The Wall Street Journal.
Carrie enters from the bathroom and hops into bed.
She grabs a LIBRARY BOOK from the night stand and looks over.
CARRIE Lean?
CARRIE He nods and lifts up one of his arms.
CARRIE She slides over and nestles in, leaning up against him.
CARRIE She opens her book.
CARRIE He looks down at it.
BIG Are you the last person in New York still taking out library books?
CARRIE I love the smell.
She smells the book, then holds it up to him.
He smells.
BIG That's an old one.
CARRIE "The Love Letters of Great Men."
CARRIE Volume one.
BIG Am I in there?
CARRIE No, but some of your classmates are.
CARRIE Voltaire, Napoleon...
Big smiles.
She takes the glasses off his face and puts them on, looks at book.
BIG You need to get glasses.
CARRIE No, I don't -- you have them.
CARRIE Here's Napoleon...
CARRIE "My dearest Josephine, I wake consumed with thoughts of you --"
BIG Typical short guy.
BIG Gives it all away up front.
She punches him a little, continues to read.
BIG (CONT'D) Why are you reading this?
CARRIE Research for my new book.
BIG What's it about?
CARRIE Love.
CARRIE I use to write about finding love-- now I want to write about what happens after you've found it.
BIG Interesting.
BIG What happens?
CARRIE Stay tuned.
He smiles.
She looks at the book again.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Listen...
CARRIE (CONT'D) Here's Beethoven.
BIG Bring it, Ludwig.
CARRIE "My thoughts go out to you today my immortal beloved.
CARRIE I can live only wholly with you or not at all."
BIG Good stuff.
CARRIE "Be calm my life, my all.
CARRIE Only by calm consideration of our existence can we achieve our purpose to live together.
CARRIE Oh continue to love me, never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved.
CARRIE Ever thine -- ever mine -- ever ours.
Silence.
The beautiful sentiment hangs in the air.
She closes the book and looks up at him.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Have you ever written me a love letter?
BIG Does a love fax count?
CARRIE When have I ever gotten a love fax?
BIG I'm pretty sure my secretary sent one at some point.
Carrie looks at him, mock disappointed.
BIG (CONT'D) What can I say, baby?
BIG (CONT'D) Not my style.
BIG (CONT'D) Besides, these guys had to write-- they were separated from their loves by wars and hundreds of miles.
BIG (CONT'D) I'm right here.
BIG (CONT'D) Hi.
She smiles.
He kisses her on the forehead.
Sincere.
BIG (CONT'D) You make me very happy.
CARRIE Yeah, yeah....
CARRIE Put it in writing.
He laughs, she looks at her book, turns a page and reads.
After a beat, he puts down his paper.
BIG Alright.
BIG Here's a love letter from me to you.
She looks up at him, excited.
He speaks romantically.
BIG (CONT'D) Loving you.
BIG (CONT'D) Is easy...
BIG (CONT'D) `cause your beautiful...
Big continues -- now SINGING the Minnie Ripperton classic.
Carrie LAUGHS as he continues to massacre the high notes.
Carrie runs past the stone lions and up the grand stairs holding three LIBRARY BOOKS in her hand.
Carrie stands at the entrance while a FEMALE GUARD (60) checks the contents of her purse.
A FLORAL DELIVERY MAN comes in carrying a GORGEOUS ARRANGEMENT OF WHITE FLOWERS.
He calls to the Guard.
DELIVERY MAN Which way's the wedding?
The Guard points, bored.
Carrie looks, interested.
A beautiful space.
The tables are being set up as MORE FLOWERS arrive.
Carrie tip-toes in and looks around.
A SMILE grows on her face.
Carrie and Big sit at the bar -- having dinner.
CARRIE I've been thinking.
BIG Again?
CARRIE How about we get married at The New York Public Library?
CARRIE Think how perfect.
CARRIE You and I and our love story surrounded by all the other lesser love stories.
BIG Do we have to make that big of a deal?
CARRIE It's not that big a deal.
CARRIE It's seventy-five people in a room that's partitioned in half.
BIG It's just -- I've already had two big weddings.
Carrie winces -- stung.
After a beat, she goes on.
CARRIE Well, what did you have in mind?
BIG I don't know -- a judge, couple friends and then we go for ham and eggs after.
A bucket of cold water.
CARRIE Interesting.
Big looks over at her.
She looks upset, hurt, sad.
Silence.
BIG Would we have to whisper?
BIG In the library?
Carrie looks over at him, softens a little.
BIG (CONT'D) "Do you, Carrie" -- Shhhh.
BIG (CONT'D) "Take this man" -- SHHHH!
He raises his eyebrow.
She laughs.
ELAINE (40) Zaftig, Jewish -- spots Carrie.
ELAINE Carrie, hi!
CARRIE Elaine, hi.
CARRIE Do you know John?
ELAINE No, hi.
ELAINE Nice to meet you.
CARRIE Elaine writes a single gal column for The New York Post.
ELAINE Please -- I'd rather you reveal my weight.
Carrie and Big laugh.
ELAINE (CONT'D)V.O.) So, what's new?
CARRIE Well.
CARRIE We're getting married.
BIG Yep -- At the New York Public Library.
Carrie looks at Big, touched.
Elaine is delighted, TEARFUL.
ELAINE Oh, my God!
ELAINE This gives me such hope.
She hugs Carrie, then hugs Big.
Then hugs Big again.
ELAINE (CONT'D) Thank-you.
ELAINE (CONT'D) Thank-you for marrying someone our age.
Charlotte, Harry and Lily are having breakfast.
A KING CHARLES SPANIEL and TWO MUTTS sit on the floor looking up at them.
Charlotte pages through the New York Post -- She notices something.
CLOSE ON: NEWSPAPER; A small PHOTO: of Carrie on "PAGE SIX" above a mention of the wedding.
Charlotte SCREAMS.
Harry and Lily JUMP.
She grabs the cordless phone from the table.
Intercut with Carrie on the phone as Big sips coffee.
CHARLOTTE "The ultimate single gal Carrie Bradshaw will be married in Manolos to New York financier John James Preston come fall."
CARRIE Our wedding's on Page Six.
BIG Who would put that in there?
Carrie shrugs, Charlotte continues reading.
CHARLOTTE "Proving to single gals everywhere that there can be a happy ending over forty."
CARRIE Oh, I know who.
Carrie is walking down the street with STANFORD.
CARRIE (V.O.) Later that day, I met my friend Stanford for our weekly quick lunch and gossip session...
CARRIE (V.O.) Also known as "dish then dash."
STANFORD According to a certain trashy tome, you are marrying John James Preston.
CARRIE Rumor has it.
STANFORD Just one question: Does Big know?
CARRIE Where are we eating?
STANFORD Anywhere you like...
STANFORD and you know the rule -- the person on Page Six pays for lunch.
Carrie laughs.
TWO WOMEN spot her and scream.
She and Stanford REACT as the women GUSH.
Carrie and Stanford are mid-meal.
Three GAY MALE friends (3O- 40) stand at their table and gush.
CARRIE (V.O.) It seemed everywhere I went...
CARRIE (V.O.) people I knew were excited and available to come to the wedding.
A WAITRESS (23) places a check on the table.
Stanford looks at it, then leans in to waitress.
STANFORD You forgot to charge us for the gaggle of gays.
Carrie and Stanford are walking by a nail salon as BITSY VON MUFFLING, socialite, comes running out -- Mid-pedicure.
She is barefoot with foam pads stuck between her painted toes.
BITSY Carrie Bradshaw Preston!
BITSY Carrie Bradshaw Preston!
Carrie and Stanford stop -- turn around.
Bitsy gushes.
BITSY (CONT'D) Mazel tov!
BITSY (CONT'D) Saw you on Page Six!
BITSY (CONT'D) September?
BITSY (CONT'D) October?
BITSY (CONT'D) When?
BITSY (CONT'D) Look!
BITSY (CONT'D) Will you look!
BITSY (CONT'D) I got so excited -- no shoes.
BITSY (CONT'D) I'm standing barefoot on a New York sidewalk probably getting trichinoses.
She hurries away, turning back to CALL as she goes.
BITSY (CONT'D) We're at the same address -- different floor.
BITSY (CONT'D) Just send it -- they'll get us the invite.
She waves, goes back inside.
Carrie looks stunned.
CARRIE (V.O.) The shocking thing was not the plethora of empty autumn social calenders but knowledge that everyone does indeed read Page Six.
Carrie opens the glass door and walks into the Vogue offices.
CARRIE (V.O.) Even people you didn't expect, like my Vogue editor, Enid.
Carrie is with ENID (60) her stunning, icy Vogue editor.
ENID We're putting together our annual "Age" issue -- and we'd like you to do forty.
CARRIE Great.
CARRIE Who am I interviewing?
ENID No.
ENID You.
ENID You are forty.
ENID I want you to be featured in the magazine as the forty year old -- and here's the brilliant twist -- bride.
CARRIE Wait -- I would be in the magazine?
ENID In bridal couture.
ENID It's a once in a lifetime opportunity - so spare me a week of faux soul-searching and just say yes.
CARRIE Enid -- I'm so very flattered but--
ENID Carrie.
ENID Vogue designers, Vogue photographers, Vogue airbrushing.
ENID Nod your head: yes.
Carrie smiles and nods.
ENID (CONT'D) Thank-you.
ENID (CONT'D) It will be a sensation.
ENID (CONT'D) We're calling it: "The Last Single Girl."
CARRIE Well, I'm hardly the last single girl.
ENID No, but forty is the last age you can see a woman photographed in a wedding gown without the unintended Diane Arbus subtext.
CARRIE I thought the issue was "great style at every age."
ENID Style yes...
ENID bride no.
CARRIE Enid -- I have no idea -- were you ever married?
ENID Briefly.
ENID In 1975.
ENID I wore Halston.
ENID Creme.
ENID One shoulder Grecian with a low-cut bodice to the waistline for a dramatic flair.
ENID The fabric in the sleeves formed oval draping on the sides.
ENID Stunning.
ENID My future husband and I saw it on a trip to Paris and he fell in love with it.
ENID (CONT'D) Insisted I be married in it.
ENID (CONT'D) So I was.
ENID (CONT'D) We had quite a beautiful party.
CARRIE Why didn't the marriage work out?
ENID Did you not hear me say my husband fell in love with my gown?
ENID Has your fiancee expressed any interest in what you'll be wearing?
CARRIE None at all.
ENID Then you may have a shot.
Carrie stands on the set of a Vogue photo shoot wearing a GORGEOUS VERA WANG GOWN.
Hair, make-up: stunning.
She is surrounded by VOGUE STYLISTS and CREW.
Carrie looks over to Samantha, Stanford and Charlotte standing on the side-lines, watching.
They signal their approval.
Carrie smiles...
tentative -- but excited.
SAMANTHA She's looking quite at home for someone who didn't think she had the bride gene.
CHARLOTTE Well, I guess with the right man...
STANFORD ...
STANFORD And the right dress.
STANFORD Charlotte and Samantha smile.
STANFORD (CONT'D) When I get married, I'm wearing something like that.
STANFORD (CONT'D) But bigger.

37. Charlotte and Stanford are looking at Carrie, moved.
CARRIE (CONT'D) A confection so special...
CARRIE (CONT'D) Samantha reaches up and wipes away a tear.
CARRIE (CONT'D) ...
CARRIE (CONT'D) It could wring a wedding tear from even the most unbelieving of women.
Carrie opens the door to find a DELIVERY MAN standing there with a very large dress box tied by a lush RIBBON.
CARRIE (V.O.) And then the impossible happened.
JUMP CUT TO: Carrie pulling back the tissue paper to reveal: her favorite wedding gown.
Carrie picks up a hand-written note on an engraved note card from VIVIENNE WESTWOOD.
It reads: "I saw the photos from the shoot.
This dress belongs to you.
Cheers!"
Carrie peeks around the closet and looks in.
The gown is hanging next to the white suit, dwarfing it.
CARRIE (V.O.) And just like that, Vivienne Westwood kicked my sweet little suit's ass.
Big leads Carrie into their new bedroom by the hand.
Her eyes are closed and she has a DESIGNER shopping bag slung over her one arm.
He moves her around the construction debris, stopping in front of the new closet's double doors.
BIG Okay.
BIG Open them.
Carrie opens her eyes.
CARRIE Double door.
CARRIE So far so good.
She opens the closet doors, revealing a beautiful oversized, walk-in closet with shelves and more shelves and places for shoes and more shoes.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Well.
CARRIE (CONT'D) You did me proud, Mister.
BIG Like it?
CARRIE Like it?
CARRIE It's love at first sight.
He smiles, proud.
She takes the DESIGNER shoe box out of her shopping bag and hands it to him.
She opens the lid, takes out a pair of COLORFUL/FUN HEELS and places them on the shelf.
She turns back to him.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Now, I believe this is all really happening.
Miranda, Charlotte and Carrie are standing in Carrie's apartment.
Empty boxes are everywhere.
Lily is coloring quietly nearby.
MIRANDA I can't believe it sold so fast.
CHARLOTTE It's a sign.
CARRIE Yeah, a sign I priced it too low.
The door buzzes.
Carrie pushes the intercom button.
CARRIE (CONT'D) That's the food -- money on the table.
CARRIE (CONT'D) I'll get started in the closet...
CARRIE (CONT'D) I should be done in seventeen years.
Carrie starts into the bathroom.
Charlotte calls:
CHARLOTTE Pink Post-it -- take.
CHARLOTTE Purple -- toss.
CHARLOTTE Yellow: Storage.
CARRIE (O.C) You're good friends.
There is a knock on the door.
Miranda opens it.
Samantha stands there with her carry-on luggage.
CHARLOTTE Samantha!
CHARLOTTE Oh my God!
Carrie re-enters from the bathroom...
stunned.
CARRIE What are you doing here?!
SAMANTHA I lot of shit went down in this place.
SAMANTHA Attention must be payed!
She reaches into her bag and pulls out a bottle of champagne.
They all CHEER.
She reaches in again and pulls out another bottle.
More cheering.
Samantha is packing Carrie's collection of CD's, tapes and albums.
She puts on a "Best of the 80's" CD.
MUSIC START: Run DMC & Aerosmith: "WALK THIS WAY."
Carrie comes out of her closet wearing an outfit that screams "80's."

JUMP CUT TO: Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha LAUGHING -- at something.
REVEAL: Lily standing in the closet, naked except for her training underpants.
Her arms are outstretched and draped with Carrie's small purses and bags.
The girls in the apartment are surrounded by many, boxes.
CARRIE (V.O.) It took four friends, three days to put twenty years into twenty-eight boxes.
Carrie walks through her now, empty apartment.
She takes one last long look and leaves.
END MUSIC.
Steve sits in a chair as Miranda hands a cup of tea to his mother MARY.
She looks up at Miranda, lost.
MARY Who are you again?
MIRANDA Oh, you know me -- I'm your daughter-in-law.
MIRANDA I'm Miranda.
MARY That's right.
Miranda nods and smiles.
Steve watches, touched.
Miranda is putting away groceries.
Steve is sitting at the kitchen table.
MIRANDA While I run over to see your mother tomorrow maybe you can take him to the first birthday party alone.
MIRANDA Then -- I'll meet you at the twins' party and you can leave and be at the bar by six.
She looks over at him.
He looks strange.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) What's the matter?
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Steve.
He starts crying.
STEVE -- I had sex with someone else.
Miranda can't believe her ears.
STEVE (CONT'D) -- And you are so amazing with Ma and everything...
STEVE (CONT'D) everything you do and I can't believe I would do that to you.
Miranda just sits -- looking at him.
STEVE (CONT'D) You and I hadn't had sex in a really long time and I --
Miranda shakes her head, turns and walks out of the kitchen.
He gets up and follows her.
STEVE (CONT'D) It didn't mean anything -- It was just once...
STEVE (CONT'D) and it's been killing me.
She stops and turns around.
He stops.
MIRANDA It's killing you?!
She starts down the hall again.
He's on her heels.
STEVE (CONT'D) It just happened...
STEVE (CONT'D) I wasn't thinking.
MIRANDA Do not follow me.
She starts up the stairs.
He stops at the bottom and watches her go.
Lost as to what to do next.
Carrie opens the door.
Miranda stands there with Brady.
She looks like she is about to burst into tears.
Big stands in the hall behind Carrie.
Unsure.
CARRIE Hi.
MIRANDA Surprise -- Here we are!
CARRIE Well, I'm so excited you are here for a sleepover.
MIRANDA We are too.
MIRANDA Aren't we B-boy?
Brady nods.
Miranda gives Brady's hand to Carrie.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Here.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Mommy has to go to the bathroom.
Miranda hurries away.
Carrie looks after her, concerned.
CARRIE Brady, do you want to go have some peanut butter?
He nods.
Carrie give his hand to Big and hurries away.
Big looks at Brady.
Brady looks up at him.
BIG Peanut butter it is.
They walk into the kitchen.
Miranda is sitting on the toilet, seat down.
Carrie at the sink.
MIRANDA Apparently you don't have sex for six months he runs out and has it with some girl at his bar.
CARRIE Steve.
CARRIE I can't believe it.
CARRIE Steve.
MIRANDA Steve.
MIRANDA When I think of everything I've done for him.
MIRANDA And this is how he repays me.
MIRANDA Man, if I didn't have Brady, I would never go back there.
Miranda looks furious.
Carrie nods, in shock.
Steve is in bed.
Miranda comes in, dressed for bed.
CARRIE (V.O.) The next night, for the sake of Brady, Miranda went against her instincts and went home.
He throws back the covers.
She looks at him.
STEVE Miranda, it's still me.
MIRANDA Is it?
She stands there and looks at him.
Shakes her head, exits.
Miranda walks into the chic hotel lobby holding Brady's hand.
She pulls a piece of luggage behind her.
CARRIE (V.O.) So Miranda left Brooklyn and came home...
CARRIE (V.O.) to Manhattan.
Brady sits on a couch in the lobby playing with his action figures.
A HOODED MOVIE ACTOR TYPE (25) sits slumped next him texting on a phone.
Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha are having brunch at a table nearby.
MIRANDA Yes, it's sad, but I'm not going to make it any sadder by staying at a bad hotel while I look for a place.
MIRANDA Pass the salt.
Charlotte passes the salt.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Plus, I have to be downtown and close to Brooklyn.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) We're going to keep things as normal for Brady as we can.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) I'll pick him up on my days...
MIRANDA (CONT'D) take him over on Steve's.
CARRIE I don't know if this question is allowed -- but how is Steve handling this?
MIRANDA Says he's devastated -- begs me to forgive him.
MIRANDA Not going to happen.
MIRANDA I can barely even look at him.
CHARLOTTE Steve -- I can't believe it.
CARRIE That's what I said.
SAMANTHA Miranda, honey -- are you sure you want to do this?
SAMANTHA It's just one time.
SAMANTHA Anyone can have a slip.
MIRANDA Well, even if I could get my head around that justification -- it's the cheating part -- the behind my back part...
MIRANDA the violation of the trust -- that's the thing that's killing me.
Samantha nods, taking it in.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Besides...
MIRANDA (CONT'D) women who stay with men who cheat are women who are afraid to be on their own.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) And that's not me -- I can handle it.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Always could.
Brady walks over holding an action figure.
BRADY Mommy, I want to go home.
Miranda nods; keeping a brave face.
Charlotte looks upset.
Charlotte and Harry are making love, gently.
She looks into his eyes -- speaks softly.
CHARLOTTE Thank-you for being you.
CHARLOTTE He smiles, touched.
CHARLOTTE She smiles -- he kisses her.
CARRIE (V.O.) Charlotte made love to Harry five times that week.
61aA INT.
SAMANTHA'S BEACH HOUSE -- NIGHT -- FALL 61aA
Smith and Samantha are sitting at the dining table.
ANAKA, (45) a Zen, low-key chef lays down plates in front of them.
SAMANTHA It's a little quick to move out, don't you think?
SMITH Her reaction is her reaction.
SMITH Thanks Anaka.
SMITH Anaka nods and walks away.
SAMANTHA He had sex once.
SAMANTHA Not even an affair.
SMITH Maybe it's not the sex.
SMITH Maybe, it's the cheating.
SMITH For me...
SMITH that would be the thing.
SMITH That it happened behind my back.
SAMANTHA That's what she said.
SAMANTHA He nods.
SAMANTHA Samantha eats.
SAMANTHA Thinks.
SMITH Look.
SMITH I know we're not married but - - if you were going to have sex with someone else...
SMITH Long pause.
SMITH He looks at her.
SAMANTHA Are you waiting for me to get out my datebook?
SMITH But...
SMITH seriously, I'd rather know first.
SMITH She gets up from the table and moves over to him.
SAMANTHA You want me to tell you if I'm going to have sex?
SAMANTHA Fine.
SAMANTHA I'm about to have sex.
SAMANTHA She sits on the table directly in front of him and opens her legs.
SAMANTHA Anaka enters -- sees her position, spins on his heels and walks back out.
SMITH Thanks Anaka.
Mary sits in a chair eating dinner from a tray.
Miranda sits on the edge of the bed near her.
MIRANDA I don't know if Steve's mentioned anything to you yet -- about us.
MIRANDA Has he?
MIRANDA Mary shakes her head: No -- concerned.
MIRANDA Miranda nods.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Well -- we've had some marriage problems -- it's not necessary to go into the details but -- I just wanted you to know that we won't be coming to see you together anymore.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) I'll be here Monday, Wednesday and Sunday -- the other days will be Steve.
MARY Who's Steve?
CARRIE (V.O.) Miranda was starting to see the upside of Alzheimer's.
The room is crowded with Carrie's boxes waiting to be moved.
Big is sitting at a computer reading his emails.
Close on screen: We see his email address is John@JJPny.com.
He clicks open a file as Carrie enters.
CARRIE Wedding crunch time.
CARRIE We need to really get serious here.
BIG Not now -- I just got an email from the the contractor -- they pushed our move-in date again -- and I have to --
CARRIE Nope.
CARRIE Wedding before contractor.
CARRIE Unless you're planning to invite him -- which would make the guest list two hundred and one.
BIG Two hundred?
BIG Jesus, Carrie -- it's gone up again?
CARRIE Blame the New York Post and Vogue.
CARRIE Two publications that have never before been uttered in the same sentence.
BIG You said: seventy-five people in a partitioned-off room.
CARRIE It's the dress.
CARRIE How can I explain this?
CARRIE It's like poker -- The dress upped the ante.
BIG Change the dress.
CARRIE No, no, no -- you haven't seen this dress.
CARRIE This dress may be the whole reason to get married.
CARRIE Well, you and the dress.
She sits in his lap.
He adjusts, uncomfortable.
CARRIE(CONT'D) How are you coming with your vows?
CARRIE(CONT'D) Just a reminder -- you are going to be saying these in front of a lot of people, so the pressure is on.
BIG Up, up.
BIG I have to finish this.
BIG Up.
He sort of "helps her" out of his lap.
CARRIE Hey...
BIG I don't have time for this.
CARRIE This is our wedding and you're not taking it seriously.
BIG No, I'm not -- It's a circus!
BIG Two hundred people -- Page Six -- This is my third marriage -- how do you think it makes me look?
Carrie looks at him, stunned by this new information.
CARRIE I didn't know that was even an issue.
CARRIE Why didn't you say anything sooner?
BIG You wanted all this.
CARRIE But -- don't you want --
BIG I want you, Carrie.
BIG That's what I want.
BIG I would have just gone down to city hall.
Tension.
He starts out of the room, moving a wardrobe box out of his way as he goes.
She stands there.
Upset.
Big is brushing his teeth.
There's a knock.
The door opens.
Carrie comes in, vulnerable.
CARRIE I think it's too late for city hall now.
BIG Well, no.
BIG I wasn't suggesting -- I was just saying.
BIG He looks at her.
BIG She looks -- devastated.
BIG (CONT'D) See.
BIG (CONT'D) That is the face I've been trying to avoid.
BIG (CONT'D) Come here.
BIG (CONT'D) She stands there.
BIG (CONT'D) He goes to her, hugs her.
CARRIE You're a great man friend.
CARRIE She buries her head in his chest; relieved.
CARRIE He exhales.
Miranda, Charlotte, Harry, Samantha, Smith, Stanford, Anthony, Bitsy and other GUESTS are gathered around a long beautifully-set table.
Carrie and Big ARRIVE at the top of the stairs.
Everyone looks up and applauds.
The desserts are being served.
Samantha stands and prepares to speak.
Harry hits a glass with a spoon...
people quiet down.
SAMANTHA Now, I know it's tradition at the rehearsal dinner for the maid of honor to reveal embarrassing things about the bride.
SAMANTHA But in our group --
SAMANTHA She looks at Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) ...
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) We never kiss and tell.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte WHOOP.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Laughter.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) So, I'd like to make a toast to the groom.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) From somewhere down the table, KARL (50) a Preppy Businessman CALLS OUT; joking.
KARL There's a word he's heard before!
The room LAUGHS.
Big smiles; tight.
Carrie leans in.
CARRIE Who is that again?
BIG Karl...
BIG a partner at the firm.
CARRIE Karl's kind of a jerk.
KARL You know what they say -- three times a charm!
SAMANTHA Hey "dick wad"...
SAMANTHA I'm speaking.
CARRIE Whooo!
SAMANTHA Now.
SAMANTHA There were times when we had our doubt about this gorgeous man.
SAMANTHA But after careful observation over the last hundred years, my doubts are over.
SAMANTHA So...
SAMANTHA here's to the groom.
SAMANTHA A man who finally got "Carrie-d" away.
Big is touched.
Then Karl feels the need to add:
KARL Here's hopin', John!
Big smiles, he has no choice.
He raises his glass.
CARRIE Jackass.
Samantha is out front with Big, Harry and Smith.
They are smoking cigars.
BIG Quite a toast, Samantha.
SAMANTHA Well, you're quite a guy.
They chuckle, then -- Samantha's smile fades.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Steve.
The men turn as Steve approaches.
He has a look of real pain and guilt and embarrassment on his face.
STEVE I don't want to bother you all --
BIG You're not bothering us.
STEVE But --- I need to talk to Miranda.
STEVE Samantha, could you -- ask her to come out.
STEVE I don't want to go in.
STEVE It's a party and all.
Samantha is trapped...
trapped and touched.
Miranda comes out of the ladies room.
Samantha spots her.
MIRANDA Hi.
MIRANDA I haven't talked to you all night.
SAMANTHA Steve's here.
The blood drains from Miranda's face.
Samantha nods.
Steve is standing with Smith, Big and Harry as Miranda comes out of the restaurant -- Samantha looks out from inside.
MIRANDA Could you give us --
The guys go inside.
Samantha gives Miranda a look and leads them away.
Miranda turns.
She glares at Steve.
STEVE You didn't leave me any choice.
STEVE You won't return my calls -- You only talk to me in front of the baby when you know I can't say anything.
MIRANDA What could you possibly have to say that could make it better?
STEVE Miranda, please...
STEVE It was just that one time.
STEVE Please -- I love you --
MIRANDA You broke us!
MIRANDA You broke us.
MIRANDA What we had is broken!
Three YOUNG SINGLE GIRLS (25) walk past them into the club.
They look back at the scene.
Miranda looks down at the ground.
Steve is paralyzed.
Miranda turns to leave -- looks back at him with daggers and hurt.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) I changed who I was for you.
Miranda goes inside.
Steve is a stone.
Miranda makes her way through the crowded bar.
She looks very rattled.
Big spots her and follows, gently.
BIG Hey.
BIG Are you alright?
MIRANDA No, I'm not alright.
MIRANDA You two are crazy to get married.
MIRANDA Marriage ruins everything.
Miranda walks away, upset.
He stands there; shaken.
Big is at the bar having a scotch.
Carrie hurries over to him.
She leans in and puts her arm on his back.
CARRIE There you are.
CARRIE I thought you skipped out on me.
She smiles, kisses him.
He smiles, sips his scotch.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Well, the all-gal sleepover is about to commence.
CARRIE (CONT'D) You gonna miss me?
BIG Don't go.
BIG Spend the night with me.
CARRIE Oh...
CARRIE One night won't kill you.
CARRIE And tomorrow you get to have me for the rest of your life.
He sips his scotch.
She looks at him, sees a glimmer of something.
Something that scares her.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Is everything okay?
He looks over -- sees her face.
Scared.
BIG I'm just tired -- I guess.
Carrie reaches up and fixes Big's hair.
CARRIE Go home and sleep.
CARRIE Now, give me a kiss good night.
CARRIE Make it good -- it's the last single girl kiss.
He looks at her as if to say something, then kisses her.
Carrie sits on the bed surrounded by Charlotte, Samantha, and Miranda all wearing matching robes.
Laying on the floor near the bed -- three open gift boxes and ribbons.
Lily sits in Carrie's lap playing with Carrie's cell phone -- in her PJ's.
CARRIE (V.O.) There we sat...
CARRIE (V.O.) like a scene out of Louisa May Alcott's: "Not-so Little Women."
CHARLOTTE I always knew she would marry Big.
SAMANTHA/MIRANDA You did not!
CHARLOTTE Yes I did!
CHARLOTTE After every break-up I secretly thought: Nope.
CHARLOTTE They belong together.
SAMANTHA You thought that after the second break-up?
CHARLOTTE Yep.
MIRANDA After the fifteenth?
CARRIE Ha ha -- hilarious -- we broke up a lot.
SAMANTHA Yes, but...
SAMANTHA after the break-ups -- comes the hot make-up sex.
Charlotte pokes Samantha; indicates Lily.
Samantha rolls her eyes.
Carrie's cell phone RINGS.
Lily wants to answer it.
CARRIE You want to answer?
CARRIE Go ahead, sweetie...
CARRIE Open it up...
Lily opens it and holds it up to her face, silent.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Say something.
LILY Sex.
They are all shocked; then: LAUGHTER, even Charlotte.
CARRIE Sweetie, that was your first bootie call.
SAMANTHA Are you sure she's not my child?
Carrie, still laughing, wipes a tear away as she takes the phone from Lily and answers it.
CARRIE Hello?
Big is sitting at the desk, a piece of paper on it.
BIG It's me.
CARRIE Oh my God -- did you just hear Lily?
BIG Hey -- I need to talk.
Carrie puts her hand to her ear, blocking the laughter.
BIG (CONT'D) I'm sitting here trying to write these vows and...
BIG (CONT'D) Is this something we really want to do?
Carrie gets out of bed; playing it "casual" to the girls.
CARRIE It's Big.
CARRIE I'm gonna take it in the--
She points to the study.
Charlotte calls to the phone.
CHARLOTTE Get some sleep, groomie!
Carrie goes into the study and closes the door.
Carrie leans against the door, her face now concerned.
CARRIE What's the matter?
BIG It's just -- everything is great as it is.
BIG I don't want to screw it up.
CARRIE You won't.
BIG I screwed it up twice before.
Big is silent.
Carrie is thinking, thinking, thinking.
CARRIE Here's the thing.
CARRIE This is me that you're marrying tomorrow.
CARRIE Me.
CARRIE Nobody else.
BIG Yeah.
CARRIE And I'm marrying you.
CARRIE It's me and you.
CARRIE And you want to know the good news there?
BIG Yeah.
CARRIE We've already both done everything we can to screw it up.
He smiles.
She is very alert -- thinking, thinking.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Is that a smile I'm hearing?
BIG Yeah.
CARRIE Now, it sounds to me like you've got a bit of writer's block on the vow front.
BIG Yeah.
CARRIE And I find - you know - as a professional writer- it's best to just, you know, stop thinking about it so much -- and go to bed.
CARRIE And in the morning...
BIG You know what to do?
CARRIE Exactly.
CARRIE And if not -- Just write this: "I will love you."
CARRIE Simple and to-the-point.
CARRIE And I swear I won't even try to take credit for it.
Silence.
Deep silence.
CARRIE (CONT'D) You're going to bed now, right?
BIG Okay.
BIG Good night.
CARRIE I'll see you tomorrow.
CARRIE Hey.
CARRIE Me and you.
He hangs up.
She looks terrified.
Dark.
Charlotte and Carrie are sharing the bed.
Carrie is wide awake.
Here eyes focused across the room on her gorgeous wedding gown: ready and waiting.
Miranda is standing in the hall putting on her earrings.
The bedroom door opens -- Carrie stands there in the wedding gown.
Carrie and Miranda catch eyes for a brief moment.
There are no words.
Lily steps around from behind Carrie.
She is wearing a long white dress and holding a LITTLE PURSE.
She looks adorable.
CARRIE There you are!
CARRIE Almost lost you under all that.
CARRIE Got your purse?
Charlotte takes Lily's hand as Anthony comes out of the dining room and spots Carrie for the first time.
ANTHONY Now there's a bride!
ANTHONY Flowers!
A flurry of activity -- attaching the veil on Carrie.
Stanford stands near Carrie ready to assist if needed.
Harry stands in the pantry doorway watching -- eating a toasted bagel.
Charlotte takes a bite -- carefully.
CARRIE Whose got a mirror?
CHARLOTTE Behind you.
Carrie turns to move to the mirror.
She is JERKED BACK.
CARRIE Stanford, you're on my dress.
ANTHONY Get off the dress!
MIRANDA Is that a rip?
CARRIE/ANTHONY Where?!
Carrie's CELL PHONE RINGS.
Anthony reaches over and picks it up, distracted by the dress situation.
ANTHONY What?
Intercut with Big...
pacing.
He doesn't look rested.
BIG Can you put Carrie on, please?
ANTHONY Not now...
ANTHONY dress emergency.
Anthony hangs up, tosses her phone onto the dining table.
ANTHONY (CONT'D) Damage?
ANTHONY (CONT'D) What's the damage?
SAMANTHA There's so much fabric I can't see.
ANTHONY Can't see anything behind this friggin' table.
ANTHONY Go, go -- everyone out into the hall.
As the girls start out -- Anthony addresses Stanford.
ANTHONY (CONT'D) You're a queen -- you should know how to step around a gown.
STANFORD Don't call me a queen.
ANTHONY Go -- Out in the hall, your highness.
Everyone except for Lily moves out into the hall.
Carrie's cell RINGS AGAIN.
Lily picks it up, opens it and holds it up to her face -- She says nothing.
Big is standing there.
He hears only Lily breathing.
BIG Hello?
Lily closes the cell phone.
Big reacts, puzzled.
She opens her little purse, drops the phone in and walks out.
Carries and company leave the building, JADED NEW YORKERS passing by react with awe at the beautiful sight.
CHARLOTTE leads Lily over to HARRY who is waiting by the Sedan.
He makes a fuss over how cute she looks.
Big's driver RAOUL (55) is waiting out front next to his car, smoking.
Big leaves his building talking on his phone.
CARRIE (V.O.) It's Carrie...
CARRIE (V.O.) leave me a message.
BIG Why aren't you calling me back?
BIG I really need to talk to you.
BIG Call me back as soon as you get this.
He closes phone.
Raoul opens the back door.
WEDDING GUESTS arrive.
Bitsy comes up to Stanford.
A DRIVER follows her carrying a LARGE box from TIFFANY.
STANFORD Looks like someone had breakfast at Tiffany.
BITSY Sweetheart, look at the size...
BITSY it's breakfast, lunch and dinner at Tiffany.
BITSY (CONT'D) Gifts?
Stanford chuckles as he points.
She points to the DRIVER and they walk away.
Anthony comes over to Stanford.
ANTHONY We have a problem.
STANFORD I know, but for Carrie's sake I've decided to ignore your attitude.
ANTHONY No, a real problem.
ANTHONY They're not here.
STANFORD They're probably stuck in traffic.
ANTHONY Both of them?
Stanford gives a look of concern.
Anthony nods.
Big's car is parked in front of the library.
Raoul is leaning against it looking at his watch.
Big is on the phone, smoking one of Raoul's cigarettes.
CARRIE (V.O.) This is Carrie, leave a message.
BIG I'm out front -- waiting.
BIG I can't go in without you.
He takes a drag on the cigarette.
Exhales.
BIG (CONT'D) Baby, this whole bride and groom thing has really thrown me.
BIG (CONT'D) I need to know that it's still us.
BIG (CONT'D) Just like you said.
BIG (CONT'D) Me and you.
Raoul KNOCKS on the window.
Big looks out.
The girls are in the process of climbing out of the limo.
Big closes the phone and looks.
Carrie gets out of the limo, her back to him.
BIG (CONT'D) Turn around baby, let me see you.
Just as he's about to see her face -- Charlotte pulls the veil over it.
Carrie is gone -- all Big can see is a bride.
He sinks back into his seat and away from the window as the girls hurry up the library stairs.
Anthony and Stanford are waiting, as are Harry with Lily and Magda with Brady, who is wearing a little tux with shorts and knee socks holding a ring pillow.
A FLURRY OF HIGH HEELS CLICKING on a marble floor is heard as Carrie and the girls arrive around a corner.
Magda GASPS, overjoyed when she sees Carrie in her dress.
MIRANDA Traffic was the worst --
Miranda kneels to hug Brady.
Samantha fluffs Carrie.
SAMANTHA Ready.
SAMANTHA We're ready.
Samantha looks over.
Anthony has a weird look on his face.
STANFORD He's not here yet.
SAMANTHA Who's not?
ANTHONY The groom.
Carrie lifts up her veil with ONE arm and looks out from under it.
She is on super high-alert.
CARRIE What's happening?
SAMANTHA Big's not here.
CHARLOTTE But we're twenty-five minutes late.
CARRIE Did anyone call him?
CARRIE Give me a phone.
CARRIE Someone give me a phone.
Samantha hands her the iPhone.
Carrie looks at it.
CARRIE (CONT'D) I don't know how to work this.
Stanford hands her a phone.
As she dials she catches a WORRIED LOOK on Charlotte's face.
Carrie turns away and holds the phone to her ear, waits.
Waits.
Then --
CARRIE (CONT'D) Are you okay?
Big is sitting in the car as it MOVES down a side street.
BIG I've been calling you for an hour.
BIG Why haven't you been answering your phone?
CARRIE I don't know where my phone is!
CARRIE What is going on?
CARRIE Where are you?
BIG I was out front --but I just left.
BIG I can't do this.
CARRIE Oh my God --
Carrie drops the phone from her ear -- She's heard the words.
The words on some level she was expecting.
CARRIE (CONT'D) He's not coming.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Oh my God.
The phone slips out of her hand and lands on the floor.
Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha don't know what to do.
SAMANTHA What do you mean he's not coming?
CARRIE Get me out of here.
CARRIE -- Get me out of here!
SAMANTHA Go, go.
SAMANTHA You take her.
SAMANTHA I'll stay here and deal with this --
She gestures to the wedding area.
Miranda and Charlotte take Carrie's arms and quickly start moving her away.
Horror on all of their faces.
Brady CALLS after them, his voice ECHOES off the marble.
BRADY Where you going, Mommy?!
Samantha looks at Stanford and Anthony -- speechless.
The LIMO DRIVER slams the limo door.
Carrie is seen through the window, sitting in back -- stunned.
Miranda and Charlotte are in the back next to her -- stunned.
Big sits, pale, staring off as the car drives away.
BIG What the fuck am I doing?
BIG What the fuck am I doing?
BIG Turn around and go back.
RAOUL It's a one way street.
RAOUL I have to go around the block.
BIG By the time we go around the block she'll be gone.
BIG No one's behind us - - Turn around!
Big's car makes a QUICK three-point turn and starts back up the one-way street as Carrie's limo turns onto it.
Raoul sees the limo -- coming.
RAOUL I think this is them.
BIG Pull over.
BIG Pull over.
Big's car pulls over, as the limo approaches.
Big powers down his window -- as the limo passes, he sees Carrie in the window --resting her head against the glass, listless.
BIG (CONT'D) Carrie!
Carrie looks up, and see's Big.
He smiles an apologetically smile.
Her limo keeps on moving.
Big watches it go.
Until...
The limo SCREECHES to a halt.
The back door flies open and Carrie almost leaps out.
Big sees her, he looks relieved.
She hurries up the street to Big's car holding her bouquet.
Big gets out of his car just as Carrie reaches him.
BIG I freaked out for a minute -- but -- I'm ready now --
Carrie HITS him with her bouquet.
It's a violent direct hit on his face.
He recoils.
She hits him again, hard...
a wounded sound escaping her throat.
BIG (CONT'D) Carrie!
She hits him again.
He ducks back into the car for protection.
She hits the bouquet on the roof of the car -- the flowers start breaking apart and flying everywhere.
CARRIE I knew you would do this -- I knew it!
Miranda reaches Carrie and holds her back by her waist.
Big gets back out of the car and starts over to her.
BIG I'm sorry -- I just --
With all she has left, she throws the broken bouquet at him.
CARRIE You left!
CARRIE I am humiliated!
Carrie starts crying.
Charlotte has arrived.
Carrie turns and falls into her arms.
Miranda and Charlotte lead her away.
Big starts over to follow.
BIG Carrie, wait --
Charlotte whips her head around and stares him down.
CHARLOTTE No!
He stops in his tracks.
A WAITRESS (20's) at the Brant Park Cafe nearby "over-pours" water into a CUSTOMER'S glass -- riveted by the scene.
Miranda and Charlotte move Carrie back into the limo.
A CAB comes down the street and HONKS at Big standing in the road; dazed.
Carrie sits in a chair.
She is holding a glass and has an Hermes blanket wrapped around her.
Miranda sits nearby holding a bottle of vodka.
Samantha paces, working on her iPHONE.
CARRIE I thought I would still be in extreme pain but I'm feeling nothing.
Carrie reaches over and holds out her glass.
CARRIE (CONT'D) I'd like a little more nothing.
Miranda nods and pours some more vodka into it...
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I had gone from Little Women to Little Drunk Women.
Charlotte enters and looks over at Carrie, soulfully.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Yes, I'm still jilted.
SAMANTHA What the hell got into him?
SAMANTHA He was perfectly fine at the dinner.
Miranda sips her vodka -- should she say anything?
CARRIE I knew it when he called last night.
CARRIE I could tell.
SAMANTHA Why didn't you say anything?
She shrugs and sips.
CARRIE Didn't want to believe it.
CARRIE Didn't even want to say it out loud.
CARRIE And now I have nowhere to love --
CARRIE I meant live.
CARRIE I have nowhere to live.
CHARLOTTE You'll stay here.
CARRIE Forever.
She sips.
Charlotte looks at her, concerned.
CHARLOTTE Maybe you should eat something.
She shakes her head.
Charlotte looks at the others.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Anyone hungry?
They shake their heads; no.
CARRIE Well, if you change your minds, I know where we can get one hundred beef, seventy-five fish and twenty- five vegetarian meals.
She sips.
Charlotte rubs her back.
She sips.
CARRIE (CONT'D) And my clothes.
CARRIE (CONT'D) All my clothes.
CARRIE (CONT'D) I can never go over there again.
CARRIE (CONT'D) How am I going to get my clothes?
SAMANTHA Oh, honey -- I can hire people to do all that.
SAMANTHA Anything you need.
CARRIE A hit man?
CARRIE I have nothing to wear but a wedding gown.
CHARLOTTE You have your honeymoon stuff here.
CARRIE There's the silver lining.
CARRIE A honeymoon to a romantic Mexican resort that's pre-paid on my credit card because I wanted to surprise the man who jilted me.
SAMANTHA I can get you out of that.
SAMANTHA Worse comes to worse -- I'll say there was a death or something.
CARRIE Wasn't there?
She sips, looking sad.
Charlotte leans down and tucks in the sleeping Lily.
She picks up a "Chinese baby doll" and nestles it under Lily's arm, then turns and starts out.
Miranda is standing in the hall as Charlotte enters from Lily's room.
MIRANDA I did something really bad -- I think.
Charlotte looks at her.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) I said something to Big.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) At the rehearsal dinner.
CHARLOTTE What do you mean?
MIRANDA It was right after Steve showed up.
MIRANDA I was upset...
MIRANDA Big came up to me -- and I said something like: You're crazy to get married.
MIRANDA It just came out.
Charlotte nods trying to understand.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Do you think it was totally the reason?
CHARLOTTE No, no, no.
CHARLOTTE Big has been weird about marriage for years.
MIRANDA I keep thinking I should tell Carrie.
CHARLOTTE No, no.
CHARLOTTE This is a really bad time to even mention it - no, no, no.
CHARLOTTE Find another time.
CHARLOTTE Later.
Samantha comes down the hall.
She is energized.
SAMANTHA Well, turns out, I couldn't get her out of the honeymoon -- but I got us in.
MIRANDA What?
SAMANTHA I just booked us three seats on the flight.
SAMANTHA Mexico here we come.
Charlotte and Miranda react; completely thrown.
MIRANDA I can't go to Mexico.
MIRANDA I have a job.
Samantha indicates Carrie -- sitting in the den staring off to nowhere, deeply sad -- Devastated.
A lush tropical road with a view of the sun setting on the ocean.
A large open air GOLF CART comes around the bend holding the girls.
Carrie's hair blows in the breeze, her sunglasses firmly in place.
A gorgeous romantic private house surrounded by tropical splendor.
The cart arrives in front.
The DOORS are open and PAULO (38) the BUTLER stands there holding a tray with two beautiful tropical drinks.
He is surprised when he sees the four women, but he covers, effortlessly.
PAULO Welcome to Mexico.
SAMANTHA Buenos dias.
Carrie gets out of the cart and goes into the house -- followed by Charlotte and Miranda.
Samantha arrives and picks up a drink off the tray.
PAULO I'm sorry.
PAULO I am confused.
PAULO I am waiting for a Mr. And Mrs. Preston.
SAMANTHA Honey, you'll be waiting for a long time.
She sips the drink, then looks at him, "familiar."
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) We'll talk.
Charlotte and Miranda stand looking at the gorgeous, romantic private Mexican bungalow.
Samantha enters; looks.
SAMANTHA This...
SAMANTHA will kill her.
SAMANTHA Where is she?
CHARLOTTE In the powder room.
Carrie stands looking in the mirror.
She takes off her sunglasses.
Her eyes are red, red, red.
She splashes water on her face and looks at herself in the beautiful Mexican mirror.
Paulo leads Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha into the romantic bedroom suite.
On the bed -- rose petals are scattered in the shape of a large heart.
MIRANDA Oh My God!
Miranda and Charlotte quickly grab the bed cover and jerk it up -- throwing all the rose petals off.
Paulo watches.
Miranda addresses him in a very intense WHISPER.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) No more honeymoon stuff.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) This is very important.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Have I made myself clear?
Carrie exits the powder room, her sunglasses in her hand.
She stands in the entry way; alone.
She looks out at the main room; the beautiful view, the romance.
Her eyes start to water.
A PORTER enters with the bags.
Carrie hides her face, acknowledging him with a nod.
Carrie enters and moves directly to the bed, past Charlotte where Miranda is sitting talking on her cell.
MIRANDA Magda -- I'll talk to you tomorrow
MIRANDA Miranda hangs up as Carrie crawls onto the bed and lays down.
MIRANDA The pink sunset light floods across her face.
SAMANTHA Well, it's a gorgeous sunset.
CARRIE Close the shutters.
CARRIE Paulo moves over to the window and starts closing the shutters.
CARRIE The sun is slowly shuttered out.
CARRIE (CONT'D) All of them.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Carrie closes her eyes.
CARRIE (CONT'D) DARKNESS falls across her face.
The room is dark except for the bright sunlight straining to get in between the cracks of the closed shutters.
Carrie is asleep.
Miranda sits on the bed.
Carrie stirs, half waking...
Miranda smiles.
MIRANDA Morning.
CARRIE Did I dream it?
CARRIE Miranda shakes her head, no.
CARRIE Carrie closes her eyes, falls back asleep.
Dark.
Carrie is still asleep.
Charlotte sits on the bed.
She gently shakes Carrie.
Carrie opens her eyes.
CHARLOTTE Carrie, it's dinner time.
CHARLOTTE You slept the whole day.
CARRIE So?
CARRIE Carrie closes her eyes.
CARRIE Charlotte exhales, concerned.
A "tingling of glass" sound wakes Carrie.
She opens her eyes and looks.
Samantha is just sitting on the bed with a breakfast tray.
SAMANTHA Honey, you have to eat a little breakfast.
CARRIE I'm tired.
SAMANTHA Eat something and you can go back to sleep.
SAMANTHA Samantha holds up a bowl of yogurt.
SAMANTHA Carrie adjusts on her pillows a little.
SAMANTHA Samantha feeds Carrie a spoonful of yogurt.
SAMANTHA Carrie looks at her.
SAMANTHA Samantha nods.
Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte are sitting having lunch.
Charlotte opens a pre-packaged "snack pack" chocolate pudding.
She peels the lid off, takes a spoon and starts eating.
SAMANTHA With all this gorgeous fresh food you're just going to eat that pudding crap the entire trip?
CHARLOTTE It's the only thing in the pantry that's totally safe.
CHARLOTTE See.
CHARLOTTE Made in Poughkeepsie.
CHARLOTTE I don't want to chance it.
MIRANDA It's a five-star resort.
CHARLOTTE It's Mexico.
72. The bedroom door opens.
72. Carrie walks out.
72. The sun hits her eyes.
72. She squints.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Carrie!
CARRIE Is there coffee?
All four girls are laying in the sun in bathing suits reading magazines.
Miranda re-adjusts her body, stretching out on her beach chair.
MIRANDA The sun feels nice.
MIRANDA Samantha looks over at her and notices something.
SAMANTHA Jesus, honey.
SAMANTHA Wax much?
SAMANTHA Miranda looks up at Samantha.
SAMANTHA Samantha indicates her swimsuit crotch area...which is badly in need of a wax.
SAMANTHA Miranda grabs her towel and covers her crotch area.
MIRANDA -- What?
MIRANDA I didn't know I was going to be in a swimsuit.
MIRANDA Carrie and Charlotte look up from their magazines.
CHARLOTTE What are you talking about?
MIRANDA I forgot to get a wax.
SAMANTHA Since when -- 1998?
SAMANTHA Carrie looks away, resumes reading.
MIRANDA I've had other things on my mind.
SAMANTHA I could be on death row and not have that situation.
MIRANDA Well, when you're married, Samantha -- you have a different set of priorities.
SAMANTHA Honey don't blame marriage --
SAMANTHA This one's married -- and she's not growing a national forest.
SAMANTHA How do you even cross your legs?
SAMANTHA Let me make you a spa appointment -- Any thicker and you won't be able to find it.
Miranda gets up from the chair and looks at her, mad.
MIRANDA So what -- It's my fault?!
MIRANDA I let the sex go out of our marriage!
MIRANDA I deserve what I got.
MIRANDA Thanks for understanding.
She walks away.

They look at her -- she sips her cocktail.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) I can't believe my life revolves around a man.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) On what planet did I allow that to happen?
CHARLOTTE You love him.
SAMANTHA Does that mean saying his name fifty times more a day than I say my own?
SAMANTHA Does it mean worrying about him and his needs before me and mine?
SAMANTHA Is it all about the other person?
SAMANTHA Is that love?
MIRANDA No, that's marriage.
CARRIE So, you're saying marriage is a bad thing?
CARRIE Good to know right about now.
Samantha looks down at her gardenia ring.

SAMANTHA To be able to do that.
SAMANTHA Then, he buys it for me.
CHARLOTTE Because he knew how much you loved it.
SAMANTHA Yes.
SAMANTHA But now, every time I look down at it...
SAMANTHA I see him.

LOUISE I'm really feeling that look on you.
LOUISE Louise reaches into her purse to get something --
CARRIE And I am feeling that Balenciaga on you.
LOUISE Mine till Tuesday.
LOUISE Louise pulls out a cell phone and holds it out to her.
LOUISE (CONT'D) Here -- time to re-join the world.
CARRIE Already?
CARRIE Louise nods.
CARRIE Carrie takes the phone.
LOUISE Your new number...
LOUISE area code: 347 --
CARRIE Hold, Hold, Hold.

Samantha sits on her deck.
Her phone rings.
SAMANTHA Samantha Jones.
CARRIE (V.O.) Carrie Bradshaw --
Intercut with Carrie walking along.
CARRIE -- Or I used to be.
SAMANTHA Talk to me.
CARRIE I'm a 347 area code.
CARRIE How tacky is that?
SAMANTHA 347 is the new New York.
CARRIE I want the old New York with the old 917 and my old will to live.
SAMANTHA Old New York, new New York -- honey -- at least it's New York.
SAMANTHA She looks -- Dante is coming out of the surf in his wetsuit.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Another hard thing about being in L.A?
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) My "sex on a stick" next door neighbor.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) I can't stop looking at him.
CARRIE Looking?
SAMANTHA Just looking.
SAMANTHA After I saw Steve's face at the rehearsal dinner, I could never ---
SAMANTHA Dante notices her on the deck.
SAMANTHA He gives her a sexy smile.
SAMANTHA She doesn't acknowledge it -- turns away and walks inside.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) But you should see this guy.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Every night sex with a different partner.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) He's like --
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) --Me.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Five years ago.
CARRIE Yes.
CARRIE When I was a 212.
Samantha strolls along Rodeo Drive.
CARRIE (V.O.) And in an effort to stay out of her house and out of trouble -- Samantha went shopping.
She notices a sidewalk "dog rescue station."
Cute puppies frolic and play in a wire pen.
99. In the back of the pen sits a tattered tiny DOG.
99. Alone.
99. Samantha can't help but look at it.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) It certainly wasn't the cutest dog in the pen - but their was something about it --
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) The dog looks up at her -- Dark marks under its eyes.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) The Rescue Woman (40) notices Samantha looking.
RESCUE WOMAN She needs a good a home.
RESCUE WOMAN Interested?
RESCUE WOMAN Samantha shakes her head; "no."
CARRIE (V.O.) And just as Samantha convinced herself that the dog wasn't for her.
CARRIE (V.O.) The dog starts humping a stuffed animal.
RESCUE WOMAN She's been fixed, but she hasn't lost the urge.
Samantha holds the dog while talking to two GROOMERS.
SAMANTHA And she needs a little eye work.
SAMANTHA Anything you can do about these stains?
SAMANTHA The dog looks up at her.
SAMANTHA She looks down at it.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Honey, I don't mince words.
Samantha and the dog walk out of Gucci in matching outfits...
looking fabulous.
Three GUCCI SALESMEN follow them holding large Gucci bags.
They walk to her sleek Mercedes SUV -- parked at the curb.
JUMP CUT TO: The back of the Mercedes SUV filled with shopping bags: Gucci, Prada, Dior -- the SUV hatch is closed, revealing Samantha's licence plate: I HEART NY.
Samantha pulls away, the dog in her lap -- fur blowing.
Carrie and Louise are in the closet unloading clothes from the boxes.
Carrie opens a wardrobe box -- It's the WEDDING GOWN.
They both look at it - not knowing what to do.
LOUISE Do you want me to get rid of it?
CARRIE No, it's too beautiful.
CARRIE I'll just bury it deep in the back -- like I did my feelings.
CARRIE Carries closes the box back up.
CARRIE Louise watches; then.
LOUISE Do you miss him?
CARRIE Every day.
CARRIE You know, it's weird -- I haven't cried very much at all.
CARRIE Maybe you're only allotted a certain amount of tears per man -- and I used mine up.
CARRIE Carrie gently pushes the box away.
CARRIE Opens another.
LOUISE Yeah.
LOUISE I know how you feel `cause, my college boyfriend broke up with me last year.
LOUISE And I miss him all the time.
CARRIE (V.O.) Suddenly, it dawned on me -- there were two broken hearts in my-walk in.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Louise -- we need a cocktail.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Grab your rental.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Carrie starts out.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Louise grabs her purse and follows.
Carrie and Louise are having cocktails.
LOUISE And it threw me so hard `cause, you know, I thought Will -- that's his name...
LOUISE was the love of my life.
CARRIE What happened?
LOUISE He said he loved me and all -- but didn't think I was "the one".
Carrie looks at her, nods.
LOUISE (CONT'D) And that hurt.
LOUISE (CONT'D) But -- you know -- whatever.
LOUISE (CONT'D) I'm not going to give up on love.
CARRIE Good.
LOUISE Love is the thing, you know.
She holds up her key chain.
The word "Love" in gold.
LOUISE (CONT'D) See that.
LOUISE (CONT'D) I'm bringing it to me all day long.
Louise gets a "text".
She reaches over and looks.
She smiles as she reads it.
Carrie raises her eyebrow.
CARRIE Oh, I remember that smile.
CARRIE Who's the guy?
LOUISE Someone I just met.
LOUISE He wants me to meet him for a drink.
CARRIE At 11:30?
CARRIE That's a bootie call.
LOUISE No, it's not like that...
LOUISE he just got off work -- he's a waiter.
CARRIE Louise, I may not get texts and I
may not send texts -- but trust me: The sub-text of that text: Bootie.
101A. Louise nods, then starts texting him.
LOUISE But it's not a bootie call if he meets me....
LOUISE right?
CARRIE All right, then.
CARRIE You kids enjoy.
CARRIE That's what your twenties are for.
CARRIE Your thirties are to learn the lessons.
CARRIE Carrie stands up, throws some money on the bar.
CARRIE (CONT'D) And your forties are to pay for drinks.
Charlotte sits on the couch, reading a magazine.
The three dogs near her.
Harry enters.

CHARLOTTE Um...
CHARLOTTE no.
HARRY You didn't go yesterday either.
CHARLOTTE I know.
HARRY Why is that?
CHARLOTTE I don't feel like running!
HARRY Okay.
HARRY Welcome to the house of hormones.
Carrie and Charlotte walk looking at furniture.
CARRIE It's all about the desk.
CARRIE If I find the desk, the writing will come.
CARRIE And it better `cause I'm using my new book advance to pay the fancy decorator.
CHARLOTTE I think it's so great that you are re-doing your entire apartment.
CARRIE Out with the old --
CARRIE -- In with the overpriced.
CARRIE Charlotte smiles.
CARRIE Carrie links arms with her.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Hey, Harry called me and mentioned you're not running.
CHARLOTTE Why'd he do that?
CARRIE `Cause he loves you...
CARRIE and he's concerned.
CHARLOTTE There is nothing to be concerned about.
CARRIE Did the doctor say it wasn't safe or something?
CHARLOTTE No, she said because I'm already a runner -- it's fine.
CARRIE So, why are you not --
CHARLOTTE I'm afraid something bad will happen.
CHARLOTTE It's a miracle that I'm even pregnant.
CARRIE But if the doctor said --
CHARLOTTE It's not rational, Carrie...
CHARLOTTE it's irrational.
CHARLOTTE I know that.
CARRIE Okay.
CHARLOTTE I've got everything I ever wanted.
CHARLOTTE I'm so happy -- I'm terrified.
CHARLOTTE No one gets everything they want.
CHARLOTTE Look at you.
CHARLOTTE Look at Miranda.
CHARLOTTE You're such good people and look what happened to you.
CHARLOTTE Of course, something bad is going to happen to me.
CARRIE Sweetie, you shit your pants this year.
CARRIE Maybe you're done.
Charlotte laughs a little.
Carrie moves her along.
CARRIE (CONT'D) You run every day -- that's what you do.
CARRIE (CONT'D) You can't stop being who you are -- just because you're afraid.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Right?
Charlotte nods, they walk on, linked together.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Now let's get down to business.
CARRIE (CONT'D) I've got to have my apartment done in time for that baby shower.
AUTUMN LEAVES fall as Charlotte walks onto the running track with the three dogs on leashes.
She starts to run -- tentative -- slowly.
They trot along with her.
Charlotte runs faster - more confident.
The dogs run along with her -- they are wearing Burberry pet sweaters.

MIRANDA I said something I shouldn't have said to Big at the rehearsal dinner.
CARRIE What do you mean?
MIRANDA I was really upset after Steve showed up and I bumped into Big and -- I said that you two were crazy to get married.
Carrie is stunned.
The waitress arrives with the new bottle of wine.
WAITRESS Here we go.
WAITRESS Your Shiraz.
She is opening the bottle.
Tension.
She pops the cork -- starts to pour.
MIRANDA Stop -- It's fine -- Thanks.
The Waitress puts the bottle down and walks away.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) I'm sorry, I was upset-- Steve had--
CARRIE I have been going over this and over this in my mind for five months -- and -- for five months you kept a secret like that?
MIRANDA I tried to tell you once but the Vogue article came out --
CARRIE Once?
CARRIE You tried to tell me once?
CARRIE You should have tried to tell me every single day!
MIRANDA I know, I was looking for the right time.
CARRIE There is no right time to tell me you ruined my marriage!
The Room is now at "attention."
MIRANDA It just happened -- I wasn't thinking.
MIRANDA Carrie grabs her purse -- to leave.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Carrie, please -- Don't go -- I --
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Carrie stands up -- the festive balloon strings bob in front of her face.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) She pushes them away.
CARRIE And I think what hurts the most is that you kept a secret from me.
CARRIE I have never ever kept a secret from you.
CARRIE Ever!
CARRIE She starts out.
CARRIE Stops, comes back -- through the ribbons.
CARRIE (CONT'D) No, I'm lying.
CARRIE (CONT'D) For the last five months I've been thinking that it's a huge mistake that you left Steve.
CARRIE (CONT'D) There.
CARRIE (CONT'D) How does it feel?
CARRIE (CONT'D) She turns and pushes balloons out of her way as she starts out.
CARRIE (CONT'D) A KISSING COUPLE (20's) is BLOCKING her way.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Excuse me!
CARRIE (CONT'D) They stop -- She squeezes by them.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Miranda is devastated.
19 Candles are lit.
19 Samantha enters wearing a sexy sheer robe and carrying a giant tray of homemade sushi.
19 The phone rings.
19 The machine picks up.
19 Smith leaves a message.
SMITH (V.O.) Babe -- we're way behind on set.
SMITH (V.O.) I still haven't been released.
SMITH (V.O.) I'll get there as soon as I can.
SMITH (V.O.) She SIGHS -- places the tray on the table.
SMITH (V.O.) Looks at the wall clock: Seven-thirty.
Eight o'clock.
Samantha is sitting in the robe near the table.
Not pleased.
Eight-thirty -- Samantha is pacing.
She takes a piece of sushi -- pops it in her mouth and chews -- pissed.
A WOMAN MOANING is heard.
She walks over and glances out the window into Dante's living room.
Candles are everywhere -- he is naked and GIVING HEAD to naked BLONDE WOMAN.
She is writhing in pleasure.
Samantha watches -- even more pissed.
CARRIE (V.O.) It was the same Valentine night Samantha had planned -- minus the sushi.
Samantha now wearing sweat clothes, sits with her arms crossed -- waiting.
The door opens and Smith enters.
SMITH I'm home!
SMITH He see's Samantha sitting there.
SMITH He smiles.
SMITH (CONT'D) (CONT'D) Man, that was a long day -- the crew went into double overtime.
SAMANTHA You are three hours late.
SMITH Bummer.
SMITH I know.
SMITH Did you eat?
SAMANTHA Yes, I ate.
SAMANTHA I ate the sushi that I hand made for you.
SAMANTHA The sushi that I planned to lay all over my naked body as a Valentines surprise for you.
SMITH Why are you so upset?
SMITH I called.
SAMANTHA I slaved away in a kitchen all day to make this meal for you.
SMITH You made some sushi -- it's not a big deal!
SAMANTHA Not a big deal?
SAMANTHA She stands up.
SAMANTHA She picks up some pieces of sushi.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) You see this -- This took me five fucking hours!
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) She throws sushi at him.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) He dodges them.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) I am not the type of woman who sits home all day waiting for a man!
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) You love California so much -- enjoy your hand-made California roll!
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) She throws more sushi and storms out.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Smith looks at the subzero fridge.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) A sushi piece slides down the front.
A FLORAL ARRANGEMENT sits on the hall table next to the answering machine.
A card reading: "I'm sorry -- Miranda" is nearby.
The answering machine is recording an incoming call from Miranda.
MIRANDA (V.O) It's me.
MIRANDA (V.O) Pick up.
MIRANDA (V.O) Are you there?
MIRANDA (V.O) Carrie is standing in the bathroom; looking out at the answering machine, brushing her teeth.
CARRIE (V.O.) Three days of "I'm sorry" calls and e-mails and flowers -- and I still wasn't ready.
CARRIE (V.O.) It was the longest we'd even gone without speaking.
Rain.
Carrie walks up to her stoop.
A CAB idling in front.
The cab window goes down.
Miranda is sitting there.
MIRANDA Carrie.
MIRANDA Carrie looks.
MIRANDA Stops.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Hi.
MIRANDA (CONT'D) I need to talk to you.
CARRIE How long have you been waiting here?
CARRIE Miranda looks to the meter, then back to her.
MIRANDA Seventeen dollars long.
MIRANDA Please get in.
MIRANDA It just turned to eighteen.
MIRANDA Carrie looks at her, hesitates, starts over to the cab.
Rain pours down the windows.
Carrie and Miranda sit in silence.
A MIDDLE EASTERN DRIVER sits behind the wheel.
CLOSE ON: THE METER.
It reads 22.00.
121. This is weird not talking.
CARRIE I'm upset.
MIRANDA Carrie, I understand -- but it just happened -- I never meant to hurt you.
MIRANDA You have to forgive me.
Carrie looks over at her.
CARRIE You know --
MIRANDA What?
CARRIE No.
MIRANDA Please.
MIRANDA What were you going to say?
CARRIE You badger me to forgive you in three days -- and you won't even consider forgiving Steve for something he did six months ago.
MIRANDA It's not the same thing.
CARRIE It's forgiveness.
CARRIE Miranda thinks -- Carrie looks at her.
CARRIE (CONT'D) And -- I know you're not the reason my marriage fell apart.
CARRIE (CONT'D) I was just - desperate to have someone else to blame.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Miranda thinks.
CARRIE (CONT'D) The METER clicks.
Steve and Miranda are sitting in front of a THERAPIST.
MIRANDA I don't know if I can trust that it won't happen again.
THERAPIST Steve - you're very quiet today.
STEVE Miranda, I know I made it hard for you to trust me.
STEVE But -- You made it hard for me to trust you.
MIRANDA Me?!
STEVE The way you treated me and cut me out of your life like that?
STEVE I mean, yeah -- I broke a vow.
STEVE But what about the other vows?
STEVE Like promising to love someone for better or for worse?
STEVE What about that?
STEVE Miranda looks down at her hands.
STEVE Steve looks at the therapist.
STEVE (CONT'D) How do I know she won't punish me for the rest of my life?
THERAPIST You don't.
THERAPIST And she doesn't know for sure that you won't have another indiscretion.
THERAPIST All you can know...
THERAPIST is that you want to move forward and risk that you love for each other won't allow that to happen.
THERAPIST Silence.
THERAPIST (CONT'D) And that's what we'll discover here.
THERAPIST (CONT'D) Steve looks over at Miranda.
THERAPIST (CONT'D) Miranda looks at Steve.
Forsythia bushes are in bloom.
Carrie and Miranda walk.
They carry sandwiches.
MIRANDA So, we're done with our last session and we're not allowed to talk for two weeks while we figure out if being together again is something we really want.
MIRANDA And then - - we had to pick a place to meet -- and if we both show up on that day - - the past no longer exists.
MIRANDA Showing up is the promise we make to each other that we're willing to let it all go and move forward.
CARRIE Can you do that?
MIRANDA I don't know.
MIRANDA I have a lot of thinking to do.
CARRIE Thinking -- or feeling?
MIRANDA What do you mean?
CARRIE Miranda -- you're a lawyer.
CARRIE You can argue both sides of any case -- but, why we feel what we feel -- isn't logical.
CARRIE It's emotional.
CARRIE Sorry, Harvard -- I'm afraid you're going to have to make this decision based on your emotions.
MIRANDA Well, then -- I'm screwed.
MIRANDA I don't know what I feel.
CARRIE You will.
CARRIE There will come a moment when you'll know.
CARRIE And if it's: yes - - all that brilliant logic will go out the window...
CARRIE with the past.
MIRANDA And I thought picking the place to meet was a challenge.
CARRIE Where is it?
MIRANDA The Brooklyn Bridge.
MIRANDA Halfway between both our places.
CARRIE Very logical.
CARRIE And yet poetic.
MIRANDA Poetic -- if we both show up.
MIRANDA Otherwise -- you're on a bridge -- rejected.
MIRANDA Not a good plan.
Carrie walks in carrying a Starbucks cardboard caddy with two coffee.
Louise is sitting at her desk, working.
LOUISE I have two pieces of good news.
CARRIE And I have two coffees.
LOUISE I just got a heads-up from your realtor.
LOUISE The apartment on Fifth finally sold.
LOUISE Carrie sips coffee.
LOUISE Nods.
LOUISE (CONT'D) You have sixty days before the new owner takes possession and you are out of there.
CARRIE What's the other news?
CARRIE Louise holds up her hand.
CARRIE There is a diamond ring on it.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Oh my God --
LOUISE I'm moving back to St.
LOUISE Louis -- we are getting married in the fall.
LOUISE Louise beams.
LOUISE Carrie hugs her.
Grey day.
Samantha is sitting on the beach reading "The Secret."
CARRIE (V.O.) Meanwhile, back in Lost Angeles...
CARRIE (V.O.) She rolls her eyes, and tosses it down in the sand.
Samantha walks on the beach.
The dog is walking with her.
CARRIE (V.O.) ...
CARRIE (V.O.) Samantha had money, a career and a man who loved her...
CARRIE (V.O.) Still, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing from her life.
The dog runs up onto the neighbor's deck.
SAMANTHA No!
SAMANTHA Come back here.
Samantha is on the neighbor's deck looking for the dog.
SAMANTHA Where are you, baby?
SAMANTHA She rounds a corner -- and comes face to face with Dante -- showering in the outdoor shower.
SAMANTHA Water runs over his NAKED and PERFECT BODY.
SAMANTHA He sees her and smiles a hot smile.
SAMANTHA She is thrown -- overwhelmed.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Sorry -- I'm your neighbor and my dog ran up on your dick--
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) --Deck!
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) There is a GROWL sound.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) She looks -- the dog is humping a towel on the deck floor.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) She looks back at Dante.
DANTE Want to join me?
DANTE Speechless -- She shakes her head: No -- she scoops up the dog and hurries away.
DANTE He calls after her.
DANTE (CONT'D) I'm Dante.
DANTE (CONT'D) Stop by -- anytime.
DANTE (CONT'D) Samantha takes a peek back and continues on her way.
Samantha is having lunch outside while on the phone.
SAMANTHA Smith is interested - but the dates will have to work with the series.
SAMANTHA Dante appears on the deck next store in a wet suit.
SAMANTHA He unzips it while looking at Samantha.
SAMANTHA SAMANTHA dips a chip in guacamole and eats it.
SAMANTHA He pulls his wet-suit down and smiles at her.
SAMANTHA She dips another chip.
SAMANTHA He steps out of it and looks at her -- almost torturing her.
SAMANTHA She looks the other way, dips another chip in guacamole and eats it.
SAMANTHA Then another.
Samantha is in the kitchen on the phone.
She picks up a slice of messy pizza from a delivery box on the table.
SAMANTHA We agreed that no one else from the show but Smith was going to be on the cover.
SAMANTHA She walks to the window and looks out.
SAMANTHA Dante is on his deck putting on sun screen.
SAMANTHA He glistens.
SAMANTHA She chews.
Samantha is in the jacuzzi -- she is looking up at Dante who is on his deck smoking a joint.
He indicates for her to come over.
She shakes her head: No.
He walks away.
She presses a button on the control panel.
The jacuzzi jets start.
She re- positions herself "on" them, then...
She reaches over and grabs a giant hot fudge sundae and...
starts eating it.
Miranda sits in the window -- having a cappuccino, alone.
On the table a legal pad with a list of PROS and CONS.
CARRIE (V.O.) With her two weeks just about up, Miranda's list of pros and cons were equal.
CARRIE (V.O.) She throws some money down on the table and takes a final sip on her cappuccino.
CARRIE (V.O.) As she stands up, she catches sight of herself in the mirrored wall.
CARRIE (V.O.) Cappuccino foam covers her top lip.
CARRIE (V.O.) She remembers.
CARRIE (V.O.) She knows.
Miranda stands on the bridge.
Alone.
She looks at her watch.
CARRIE (V.O.) It suddenly dawned on Miranda that Steve's list might have had more cons then pros.
CARRIE (V.O.) Just as this reality hits -- the CROWD parts and Steve is seen RUNNING up the bridge...
CARRIE (V.O.) towards her.
Miranda and Steve walk along the bridge towards Brooklyn.
CARRIE (V.O.) And Miranda never looked back...
Steve and Miranda are making love -- it is passionate.
CARRIE (V.O.) Well, almost never.
CARRIE (V.O.) Miranda turns her head back to look at Steve.
MIRANDA Kiss me.
Carrie's apartment is transformed.
It is sleeker, polished, more grown-up, with a warm, modern feel.
CARRIE (V.O.) And at home -- everything felt and looked different -- and yet still very much me.
CARRIE (V.O.) Carrie -- BLONDE again -- walks out of the kitchen with Lilacs in a large vase.
CARRIE (V.O.) The door bell buzzes.
Carrie opens the door.
Miranda stands there with a very pregnant Charlotte.
CARRIE Sorry.
CARRIE This is a very exclusive party.
MIRANDA We're on the list.
MIRANDA Miranda Hobbes plus one...and a half.
WOMEN FRIENDS chatting and having fun.
The front door is open and a coat rack is visible in the hall.
A couple of WAITERS (20's) move around.
ANTHONY comes up to Carrie.
ANTHONY A woman just put a glass down on your new desk without a coaster.
ANTHONY I told her if she did it again I'd break her arm.
CARRIE Thanks.
He walks on.
Miranda wanders up to Carrie.
MIRANDA Where's Samantha?
MIRANDA Her plane landed two hours ago.
CARRIE You know her, probably ran to the hotel gym for a quick work-out.
Samantha appears in the doorway wearing a summer coat -- the dog is in her purse.
SAMANTHA There's no place like home.
CARRIE Sweetie!
They kiss -- She goes to Miranda; they kiss.
MIRANDA There's a rat in your purse.
CARRIE And that rat better be house trained.
A CATER WAITER walks over to her.
CATER WAITER Can I take your coat?
Samantha nods and takes off her coat.
Revealing: She has a belly.
A very non-Samantha big fat gut.
Carrie looks at it.
Miranda looks at it.
Carrie and Miranda exchange looks.
Charlotte comes running down the hall.
CHARLOTTE Samantha!
Samantha raises her arms to greet her.
Her blouse rides up, the gut peeks out.
Charlotte reacts; shocked.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) You have a -- dog!
SAMANTHA Did you ever think you'd see the day -- me with a pooch.
SAMANTHA All three shake their heads: No.
Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte are in the bathroom.
MIRANDA So, she has a belly.
MIRANDA So what?
CARRIE No, a belly on anyone else is a "so
what?" A belly on Samantha is a: "So what the hell is going on?"
CHARLOTTE She never mentioned it on the phone?
CARRIE Never.
CARRIE And when has she ever not talked about every detail regarding her body?
CHARLOTTE Should we even bring it up?
MIRANDA What -- like a fat intervention?
MIRANDA "We love you -- have a salad?" No.
MIRANDA We should let her bring it up.
MIRANDA There is a knock...
MIRANDA Samantha opens the door.
MIRANDA She's eating a piece of cake.
SAMANTHA Ladies, we can talk about my gut later-- right now, I'm bored to tears here.
SAMANTHA She gives them a look.
SAMANTHA They smile, relieved.
Everyone has left.
Samantha is sitting with Charlotte and Miranda and Carrie.
They are having coffee.
SAMANTHA I eat -- so I won't cheat.
MIRANDA What exactly are you eating?
SAMANTHA Everything except Dante's dick.
CARRIE Language, please -- this is a grown- up apartment now.
SAMANTHA I guess I didn't realize how big I was until I saw it on your faces.
CARRIE How -- and I say this with love -- How could you not realize it?
SAMANTHA I've been avoiding mirrors.
CHARLOTTE I'm proud of you for not cheating.
SAMANTHA I don't know if there's anything to be proud of.
SAMANTHA I stuff my face to stop myself from doing something that feels natural to me.
SAMANTHA Carrie reaches over and rubs Samantha's back.
CARRIE Why didn't you say something?
SAMANTHA I guess I didn't want to admit it.
SAMANTHA And when you're in denial -- you don't dial.
CARRIE Now, listen -- this isn't about the weight.
CARRIE You'd be gorgeous at any size.
CARRIE But are you happy?
SAMANTHA Relationships aren't always about being happy, right?
SAMANTHA How often do you feel happy in your relationship?
CARRIE I'm pretty sure that's to you.
CHARLOTTE Every day.
SAMANTHA You feel happy ever day?
CHARLOTTE Not all day -- everyday -- but everyday.
MIRANDA When was the last time you felt happy?
SAMANTHA Six months ago.
They react.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) What am I going to do?
CARRIE What does your gut tell you?
SAMANTHA I know but --
SAMANTHA Smith stayed with me through chemo.
SAMANTHA If he could stay with me through that, I should be able to stay in this relationship for him.
CARRIE Sweetie...
CARRIE You just compared your relationship to chemo.
Samantha looks at her, then Charlotte, then Miranda.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) There we were...the three mirrors Samantha couldn't avoid.
CARRIE (CONT'D) And Samantha?
CARRIE (CONT'D) Samantha looks.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Carrie points.
CARRIE (CONT'D) The dog is humping a pillow on Carrie's furniture.
CARRIE (CONT'D) That pillow cost three hundred dollars.
Samantha is sitting -- waiting.
Smith enters.
SMITH Hey -- You're home!
SMITH I thought you were staying the week.
SMITH He kisses her.
SMITH She looks at him.
SMITH Touches his face.
SAMANTHA We need to talk.
SMITH Awwww...
SMITH man.
SMITH I knew this was coming.
SAMANTHA Yeah.
SAMANTHA This isn't working.
SAMANTHA I've done my best.
SAMANTHA I've given it five years and fifteen pounds.
SMITH What -- You don't love me any more?
SAMANTHA Yes, I love you - ah, fuck it -- I'm just gonna say the thing you're not supposed to say -- I love you but I love me more.
SAMANTHA And I've been in a relationship with myself for forty-nine years and that's the one I need to work on.
SAMANTHA She stands up and wraps her arms around him, whispers.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) You'll find a wonderful woman who loves being in a relationship.
SMITH What will you find?
SAMANTHA I don't know.
SAMANTHA But that's a risk I'm willing to take.
SAMANTHA She notices the gardenia ring on her finger.
SAMANTHA She starts to take it off.
SAMANTHA Stops.
SAMANTHA Looks back up at him.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) No.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) I'm keeping this.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Every time I look down at it I want to think of you.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) She kisses him on the lips.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) GENTLY.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) SOFTLY.
Samantha sits in first class.
She is crying...
while eating a hot fudge sundae.
A STEWARDESS leans down.
STEWARDESS We're landing in new York.
STEWARDESS I'm gonna need to take that now.
STEWARDESS Samantha nods, and finishes eating the hot fudge sundae as fast as she can.
STEWARDESS Scraping, almost licking the bowl.
CARRIE (V.O.) As someone returned to my life...
Carrie stands at the door with Louise.
CARRIE (V.O.) ...
CARRIE (V.O.) Someone left.
LOUISE And I put all the unopened mail from your P.O. Box in the manila envelopes on the bottom shelf there.
LOUISE She points to the shelf in the new bookcase.
LOUISE Carrie looks.
LOUISE (CONT'D) And please -- please do not make a mess of CarrieBradshaw.com -- it's my masterpiece.
CARRIE What am I gonna do without you?
LOUISE You'll find some other girl...
LOUISE but she won't have my style.
CARRIE St.
CARRIE Louise, you brought me back to life.
Emotion floods Carrie; she chokes up.
So does Louise --
LOUISE And you gave me Louise Vuitton.
Carrie laughs -- they hug.
LOUISE (CONT'D) Serious.
LOUISE (CONT'D) We need to stop cryin'.
Louise breaks the hug and takes her "love" key chain out of her purse -- hands it to Carrie.
LOUISE (CONT'D) Your keys.
CARRIE Wait -- don't forget your "love."
LOUISE No, I found my love.
LOUISE I'm leaving that with you.
Carrie smiles.
Louise starts out the door, turns back.
LOUISE (CONT'D) See you at my wedding.
CARRIE I'll meet you in St.
CARRIE Louis.
Louise gives one last look, and leaves.
Carrie closes the door.
Looks down at "love" in her hand.
Carrie is sitting at her desk...
typing.
CARRIE (V.O.) Now, there were no more distractions.
CARRIE (V.O.) And as I moved on...
Samantha walks past Lovro and Magda sitting on chairs out front, sipping ice tea, and up to Miranda's lower east side apartment stoop with the dog on the leash.
CARRIE (V.O.) ...
CARRIE (V.O.) Samantha moved in.
CARRIE (V.O.) The HOT TATTOOED LATIN GUY is still sitting on the stoop out front with the ferocious looking pitbull.
CARRIE (V.O.) She starts up the stairs.
CARRIE (V.O.) He checks her out.
CARRIE (V.O.) She turns.
SAMANTHA Hi, I'm your new neighbor.
HOT NEIGHBOR Diego.
SAMANTHA Samantha.
SAMANTHA They smile.
SAMANTHA There is a connection.
SAMANTHA Samantha looks down.
SAMANTHA The dog is humping the pitbull.
SAMANTHA Diego nods approval.
A very, very pregnant Charlotte carrying shopping bags is being seated at a banquette by the HOSTESS (26).
HOSTESS When are you due?
CHARLOTTE Next week.
HOSTESS You look gorgeous.
CHARLOTTE Oh, thank-you.
CHARLOTTE The Hostess walks away as Charlotte settles in and looks around.
CHARLOTTE Her eyes WIDEN.
CHARLOTTE Big is sitting across the room at a table -- alone.
CHARLOTTE He hasn't seen her.
CHARLOTTE Charlotte starts to panic as the WAITRESS (20's) comes over.
WAITRESS Hi, can I --
CHARLOTTE No, I'm sorry -- I can't stay -- Help me -- pull out the table.
CHARLOTTE I can't --
CHARLOTTE Charlotte pulls herself up off the banquette.
CHARLOTTE As she tries to slide out, her belly and shopping bags knock things off the table.
CHARLOTTE Crash.
CHARLOTTE DINERS looks.
CHARLOTTE Big spots her -- their eyes meet.
CHARLOTTE She moves away as quickly as she can through the room.
CHARLOTTE He gets up and follows after her.
Charlotte exits the restaurant -- visibly upset.
Big is quickly on her heels.
BIG Charlotte.
BIG Charlotte wait --
BIG He catches up to her - and gently steps to her.
BIG (CONT'D) You're pregnant -- don't run.
CHARLOTTE I don't want to see you.
CHARLOTTE She starts crying and talking though the tears.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) I'm so mad at you.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) I was always on your side and then you did that to Carrie -- No, no -- I'm not going to cry -- I'm not going to waste tears on you --
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) I curse the day you were born!
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Charlotte's eyes widen.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) She stops moving, entirely.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) I think my water just broke.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Oh my God -- Taxi!
BIG My car's right there.
BIG Get in my car.
CHARLOTTE I don't want to get in your car -- I hate your car.
CHARLOTTE Taxi!
BIG Charlotte -- we need to get you to the hospital -- Please get in my car.
BIG It's right here and ready.
BIG Charlotte finally nods.
BIG Big hurries her to the car.
Carrie hurries down a corridor -- looking for a room.
She spots it, knocks and enters.
Carrie enters.
Harry stands there.
Beaming.
CARRIE Hi.
CARRIE Congratulations...
CARRIE A girl!
HARRY It's my lot in life to be surrounded by beautiful women.
HARRY She kisses him and walks over to the bed where Charlotte is holding ROSE, a beautiful baby with thick dark hair.
CARRIE Oh my God.
CARRIE She's gorgeous.
CHARLOTTE Say hello to Rose.
CHARLOTTE Carrie kisses Charlotte on the head.
CARRIE What a beautiful name.
CHARLOTTE After Harry's "Bubbie."
HARRY Now, we got a Lily and a Rose.
Carrie sits on the edge of the bed.
CARRIE Well, I have to say you two are very cool customers -- just making the "baby's here" call without all the "I'm in labor" drama.
HARRY Oh -- there was plenty of drama.
CHARLOTTE My water broke in front of a restaurant.
CARRIE Very dramatic.
HARRY Wait -- she's not done.
CHARLOTTE It broke while I was talking to Big.
CARRIE What?
HARRY See.
HARRY Drama.
CHARLOTTE I bumped into him and I got so upset I started crying and then - my water broke.
HARRY He brought her to the hospital.
HARRY Stayed until the baby was born.
CHARLOTTE I think he was hoping to see you.
Silence.
Carrie is having a hard time with this.
CARRIE Well -- today is not about him.
CARRIE It's about beautiful baby Rose.
CARRIE So -- we know she has Charlotte's hair -- what else do we know?
CARRIE Harry and Charlotte give each other a sad glance.
Carrie walks out of Charlotte's room with Harry.
CARRIE She's a doll.
CARRIE Mazel tov!
CARRIE She kisses Harry on the cheek and starts away.
HARRY He asked me to ask you to call him.
HARRY Carrie stops.
HARRY Turns around.
HARRY Looks at him.
HARRY (CONT'D) I know!
HARRY (CONT'D) It's none of my business.
HARRY (CONT'D) But I felt bad for the poor schmuck hanging around the hospital waiting room hoping to see you.
HARRY (CONT'D) I swear every time he heard someone in heels coming down the hall -- his heart stopped.
CARRIE Harry -- it's so much more complicated than you can imagine.
HARRY I know it is -- and you have every right to never call him -- but I'm just a big pile of love today --and I feel bad for the guy.
HARRY He said he's been writing you -- but you never responded.
CARRIE He's never written me.
HARRY He said he wrote because he didn't have your phone number.
CARRIE No.
CARRIE He's never written me.
CARRIE Ever.
HARRY Then, why would he say that he had?
HARRY Carrie looks at Harry.
HARRY Lost.
HARRY Confused.
Carrie enters her apartment.
She glances over at her bookcase -- Remembers.
JUMP CUT TO: Carrie opens the bookcase drawer and takes out a Manila envelope marked: P.O. Box.
JUMP CUT TO: Carrie dumps the contents of the envelopes on the desk.
JUMP CUT TO: Carrie quickly sorts through the mail -- looking -- looking for something.
A letter -- something.
Nothing from him.
She leans back in her chair -- more confused.
Her eyes drift up to her computer.
She wonders if --
JUMP CUT TO: Carrie is logging onto CarrieBradshaw.com.
She types in PASSWORD.
JUMP CUT TO: CarrieBradshaw.com's "welcome page."
She clicks on EMAIL.
JUMP CUT TO: Carrie scans through emails -- none are from Big.
Frustrated she logs off.
Carrie is still at her desk, lost in thought.
CARRIE (VO) Two hours, two manila envelopes and countless emails later, I was just about to give up on the Big riddle when --
She looks back at her computer screen and notices:
"CB-assistant."
Carrie sits up.
Clicks on it.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I had told Louise to put Big in a place where I would never have to hear from him again.
She types in her password.
Nothing.
Picks up her phone.
Dials a number.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Hey, Louise -- it's me.
CARRIE (CONT'D) What's the password to get into your assistant file?
CARRIE (CONT'D) Call me.
She hangs up and places the phone on a pile of mail -- which causes the mail to fall over onto the floor.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Shit.
Carrie reaches down to pick-up the mail -- she notices the "LOVE" key chain has fallen as well.
She picks it up and looks at it, has a hunch.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Oh my God.
JUMP CUT TO: Carrie types the password: "L-O-V-E."
Yes!
The file opens -- her eyes widen.
There on the screen are many, many, many emails -- all from JJP@JJP.com.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) As soon as I typed in "love" -- there he was.
She clicks on the first e-mail.
It opens:
It's the love letter from Beethoven, retyped.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And because Big still didn't have the words...
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) he retyped a love letter from Beethoven.
JUMP CUT TO: New Email: A love letter from Lord Byron.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And Lord Byron.
JUMP CUT TO: New Email: A love letter from James Joyce.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And James Joyce.
JUMP CUT TO: New Email: A Love letter from Voltaire.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And Voltaire.
143. JUMP CUT TO: Carrie sits in the chair.
143. Breathless.
143. Overwhelmed.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) There they were.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) "The Love Letters of Great Men - Volume One."
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Plus one more...
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Written by John James Preston.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) New email -- It reads: "I know I screwed it up -- but I will love you forever."
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Carrie impulsively picks up the phone -- starts to dial.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I wanted to call him - but our love...
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Carrie and Big: volumes one, two, and three...
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) stopped me.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) She puts the phone down and is about to "delete" the e mail -- suddenly; the phone rings.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Hello.
LOUISE (O.C.) I didn't hear my phone.
Intercut with Louise, standing in a wedding gown.
Her MOTHER (45), GRANDMOTHER (65), and SISTERS (20 15, 8) sit watching.
LOUISE We are shopping for my wedding gown.
LOUISE ANGELA, her youngest sister calls out.
ANGELA That one makes you look weird.
LOUISE Momma -- can you please -- This is a work call.
LOUISE The Mother motions for Angela to sit down.
LOUISE She does.
CARRIE No, it's okay I figured it out.
LOUISE Well, I was going to call you anyway -- today is the final day on the Fifth Avenue apartment.
LOUISE You have till six before they change the locks.
CARRIE I don't need to go over there.
LOUISE And do you NOT want those never- worn shoes?
CARRIE Oh -- I completely forgot about --
LOUISE `Cause if you don't -- send them on to me.
LOUISE I'll squeeze my feet into them.
CARRIE It's already five o'clock.
LOUISE Hello?
LOUISE There are never been worn four hundred dollar shoes!
CARRIE Five twenty-five.
CARRIE Bye.
CARRIE Carrie drops the phone and jumps up.
Carrie runs down the stairs...
she spots a passing CAB.
CARRIE Taxi!
CARRIE It SCREECHES to a halt.
CARRIE She runs to the cab.
Carrie steps into the elevator.
She presses "PH," steps back.
The doors close.
Key in the lock -- Carrie enters.
She looks around.
CARRIE (V.O.) The light in our pre-war apartment looked completely different post- war.
234 Carrie walks into the bedroom and over to the closet.
234 She pushes open the other double door...
234 Revealing --
234 Mr. Big - standing there holding the Manolos in his hands.
234 He looks up -- surprised by her.
BIG I was going to get these to you.
BIG I didn't want it to be a total loss.
CARRIE (V.O.) It wasn't logic -- it was love.
CARRIE (V.O.) She walks into the closet and over to him.
CARRIE (V.O.) She throws her arms around him.
CARRIE (V.O.) He drops the shoes.
CARRIE (V.O.) They kiss.
CARRIE (V.O.) It's passionate.
CARRIE (V.O.) Very -- very passionate.
CARRIE (V.O.) Carrie and Big are nestled up next to each other on the carpeted floor of the empty walk-in closet.
CARRIE (V.O.) His suit jacket is off.
CARRIE (V.O.) Her shoes are off.
CARRIE Why did we ever decide to get married?
BIG I guess we were afraid it meant something if we didn't.
BIG She looks at him and nods.
BIG It's true.
BIG (CONT'D) I'm sorry to have done that to you.
BIG (CONT'D) Silence.
BIG (CONT'D) She touches his lips.
CARRIE I'm sorry to have done that to you...
CARRIE And you know the funny part?
BIG Is there a funny part?
CARRIE We were perfectly happy before we decided to live happily ever after.
BIG Yep.
BIG The jokes on us.
She nods...
she looks around.
CARRIE Good closet.
BIG Thanks.
CARRIE Comfortable.
CARRIE Is this what you had in mind when you installed the carpet?
BIG I'd like to think I was that smooth.
CARRIE We better get up before the new owner bust in on us.
They start to get up.
Carrie rises first.
He starts to get up, first -- sitting on his side...
BIG And the way we decided to get married -- All business...
BIG No romance.
BIG That's not the way you propose to someone.
He moves further up -- onto one knee -- where he stops.
BIG (CONT'D) This is.
She looks down at him -- Is this happening?
He holds out his hand.
She places her hand in his.
BIG (CONT'D) Carrie Bradshaw -- love of my life - - will you marry me?
BIG (CONT'D) It is everything Carrie Bradshaw had convinced herself would never happen.
BIG (CONT'D) Could never happen.
BIG (CONT'D) And here it is.
BIG (CONT'D) She nods.
BIG (CONT'D) Speechless.
BIG (CONT'D) Overcome.
BIG (CONT'D) He smiles.
BIG (CONT'D) See, this is why there's a diamond.
BIG (CONT'D) You need to do something to close the deal.
BIG (CONT'D) She laughs.
BIG (CONT'D) He notices her never-worn Manolo on the floor.
BIG (CONT'D) He picks it up.
BIG (CONT'D) Holds it out to her.
BIG (CONT'D) She lifts her foot and places it in the shoe.
BIG (CONT'D) Cinderella style.
Carrie stands with Big in front of a JUDGE.
She is wearing the simple white suit and her never-worn Manolos from the closet.
CARRIE (V.O.) And in the end...
CARRIE (V.O.) Carrie Bradshaw married John James Preston in a label-less dress.
CARRIE (V.O.) Big Smiles.
CARRIE (V.O.) She smiles.
CARRIE (V.O.) Both calm.
CARRIE (V.O.) Sure.

JUDGE You may kiss the bride.
JUDGE Big and Carrie kiss.
JUDGE Then, he whispers into her ear.
BIG Ever thine.
BIG Ever mine.
BIG Ever ours.
Carrie and Big walk through the courthouse lobby toward the front door holding hands.
BIG You okay that it was just us?
CARRIE Perfect.
CARRIE You and me -- like I said.
BIG Still.
BIG Would have been nice if you had the girls here.
BIG He holds the door open for her as they walk outside.
Carrie and Big walk out of the courthouse into the sun.
BIG Which is why I called them.
BIG Carrie looks.
BIG Miranda, Charlotte, and a MORE SLENDER Samantha are standing there.
BIG They SCREAM and throw rice.
MIRANDA/SAMANTHA Congratulations!
CHARLOTTE Mazel tov!
CHARLOTTE As the rice hits...
CHARLOTTE Carrie screams and Big laughs.
CHARLOTTE A GUARD hurries over to them.
CHARLOTTE Carrie is spitting out rice.
GUARD Excuse me -- excuse me!
GUARD You're not allowed to throw rice anymore.
SAMANTHA Honey, get over it -- It's New York!
SAMANTHA She winks at the guard.
SAMANTHA He shrugs and walks away.
Big, Carrie, Miranda, Steve, Brady, Charlotte, Harry, Lily, rose, Stanford, Samantha are casually gathered around a couple of tables that have been pushed together.
A WAITRESS comes over balancing hot plates.
WAITRESS Who had the ham and eggs?
WAITRESS Big raises his arm.
WAITRESS The waitress hands the plate down...
WAITRESS Carrie intercepts it and places it in front of Big.
CARRIE (V.O.) It wasn't a fancy designer reception either.
CARRIE (V.O.) Just food and friends.
CARRIE (V.O.) The Waitress hands out the other breakfasts.
CARRIE (V.O.) People LAUGH.
CARRIE (V.O.) Samantha feeds bacon to the dog -- who is wearing a tiny bridal veil on his head.
Carrie's books are displayed on a BOOK KIOSK.
Carrie stands in front of it READING to a crowd from the galleys of her new book.
She is wearing READING GLASSES.
CARRIE Maybe some labels are best left in the closet...
Bustling.
Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha -- back to her fighting weight -- walk down the busy street dressed for a night on the town.
They laugh as they go -- their designer purses swinging.
CARRIE (V.O.) ...
CARRIE (V.O.) Maybe when we put a label on people...
CARRIE (V.O.) bride, groom, husband, wife, fat, thin, married, single...
CARRIE (V.O.) we forget to look past the label and see the person.
CARRIE (V.O.) They arrive at the club entrance.
CARRIE (V.O.) A line of PEOPLE wait to be let inside.
CARRIE (V.O.) The DOORMAN (30's) spots Carrie, lifts the red rope and lets the girls in -- closing it after them.
The four girls sit at a table drinking "Cosmopolitans."
CHARLOTTE Hmmm.
CHARLOTTE This is delicious.
MIRANDA Why did we ever stop drinking these?
CARRIE Because everyone else started.
SAMANTHA Well, that is an oldie but goodie.
CARRIE And speaking of an oldie but goodie...
A WAITER brings birthday cake to the table.
The number: "50" stands proud and tall among the glowing candles.
He places it down in front of a proud Samantha.
CARRIE (CONT'D) Wait -- wait -- a toast.
CARRIE (CONT'D) The girls lift their glasses to Samantha.
CARRIE (CONT'D) To Samantha...
CARRIE (CONT'D) fifty and fabulous!
CARRIE (CONT'D) Samantha smiles, touched -- then blows out her candles.
CARRIE (CONT'D) To us...
CARRIE (CONT'D) and the next fifty!
CARRIE (CONT'D) Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha raise their glasses.
ALL To the next fifty.
ALL They sip and look at one another.
CARRIE (V.O.) And there, in the same city where they met as girls, four New York women entered the next phase of their lives...
CARRIE (V.O.) dressed head to toe in love.
CARRIE (V.O.) Samantha licks some icing.
CARRIE (V.O.) Charlotte cuts the cake.
CARRIE (V.O.) Miranda helps.
CARRIE (V.O.) Carrie smiles and sips.
CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And that's the one label -- that never goes out of style.
From outside we catch just a glimpse of Carrie and the girls at their table inside the busy club.
The CAMERA starts to move away -- passing the line of PEOPLE waiting to get in.
At the front of the line four TWENTY-SOMETHING WOMEN stand waiting for the red rope to be lifted.
As the CAMERA moves past them and UP -- the Doorman lifts the red rope and the twenty-something women SQUEAL with excitement and anticipation as they hurry inside.
The CAMERA continues UP and UP and over the busy and exciting city.
