THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON
Written by
Eric Roth
Based on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald
As all things do, it begins in the dark.
EYES blink open.
Blue eyes.
The first thing they see is a WOMAN near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind blowing, rattling a window.
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) What are you looking at?
CAROLINE The wind, Mother...
CAROLINE They say a hurricane is on its way...
CAROLINE You've been asleep...
CAROLINE I was waiting to see you...
Now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white enamel paint trying without success to hide the years...
An old WOMAN, past 80, withered, still regal with a green turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her blue eyes looking out at us from her bed...
She's connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine drip...
Her name, is DAISY FULLER.
She speaks with a Southern lilt.
DAISY If it wasn't for hurricanes we wouldn't have a hurricane season.
CAROLINE I've forgotten what the weather can be like here.
CAROLINE I've lived with four seasons so many years now.
We see a young Black Woman, a "caregiver," DOROTHY BAKER, in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the window...
DOROTHY BAKER I saw on the news they're predicting trouble...
DAISY 1928 they stacked people like firewood to close a hole in a levee.
But Daisy has other things on her mind...
murmuring...
DAISY (CONT'D) It all runs together...
DAISY (CONT'D) like a fingerpainting...
DAISY (CONT'D) I feel like I'm on a boat, drifting...
CAROLINE Can I do anything for you, Mother?
CAROLINE Make anything easier?
DAISY Hmmm.
DAISY There is nothing to do, Caroline.
DAISY This is what it is...
DAISY I'm finding it harder to keep my eyes open...
DAISY my mouth all filled with cotton...
And agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her nightgown as if it were sticking to her...
she starts to take it off...
Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her.
DOROTHY BAKER There, there, Miss Daisy...
DOROTHY BAKER you'll scratch yourself to ribbons...
DOROTHY BAKER It's their way of letting go...
DOROTHY BAKER ...prob'ly today.
Caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her admonition of death being so close at hand, makes everything even more present...
CAROLINE Do you want more medication, Mother?
CAROLINE The doctor said you can have all you want.
Daisy is quiet, looking into the distance.
Caroline, seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to cry.
Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter, comforting her.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) A friend told me she never had a chance to say goodbye to her mother.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) I wanted to thank you, Mother, for bringing me into this world.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) For raising me so well.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) I wanted to tell you how much you've meant to me.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) I'm going to miss you so much...
They hold each other for some time...
They separate...
And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk about...
nothing left to say to each other...
a hole in their relationship...
Caroline fills it with the eternal question...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Are you afraid?
DAISY Curious.
DAISY What comes next...
She winces at some physical pain.
DOROTHY BAKER The pain's coming more steadily...
DOROTHY BAKER Her breathing will falter soon...
DOROTHY BAKER No need for her to suffer..
She raises the morphine level...
Daisy closes her eyes...
drifting with the morphine...
and a thought, a dream, a sound, crosses her mind...
and she says...
DAISY They built that train station in 1918.
DAISY Your father was there the day it opened...
DAISY He said a tuba band was playing...Oom-pah-pah...
And we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new
DAISY Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The finest clockmaker in all of the South built that clock...
We see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless array of clocks and watches...
DAISY'S (V.O.) His name was Mr. Gateau.
DAISY'S (V.O.) Mr.
DAISY'S (V.O.) Cake.
The slightest of smiles crosses Daisy's lips...
saying to herself again...
"Mr.
Cake..."
We see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small, delicate hands, "Mr.
Cake," working in his downstairs workshop.
More than a few clocks stroke midnight, a handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop...
DAISY'S (V.O.) He was married to a Creole of Evangeline Parish and they had a son.
Taking his arm, she helps him up to show him to his bed.
DAISY'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Did I mention, Mr. Gateau was from birth, absolutely blind.
...The clockmaker his fine hands blindly working...
DAISY'S (V.O.) And when their son came of age, like boys will do, he joined the army.
DAISY'S (V.O.) They saw him off at the old train station.
An old wooden barn of a building.
Their son, hugging his parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other soldiers, pulling away...
Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his hat goodbye to his son...
DAISY'S (V.O.) Oh how he worked, for months he did nothing but work on the clock for the great train station.
The sound of clocks constant ticking.
Mr. Gateau at work...
DAISY'S (V.O.) One day a letter came...
Blanche comes into the workshop...
a letter in her hand...
She reads to her blind husband...
BLANCHE DEVEREUX "I am sorry to inform you that your son was killed fighting for his country, at the battle of the Marne.
BLANCHE DEVEREUX In the death of Sgt.
BLANCHE DEVEREUX Martin Gateau I lose one of my most trusted men.
BLANCHE DEVEREUX (CONT'D) When I informed members of our company he had fallen, on every face could be seen the mark of sorrow...
BLANCHE DEVEREUX (CONT'D) ...we were in hope the Lord would spare him to return home together...
BLANCHE DEVEREUX (CONT'D) Alas this was not to be.
BLANCHE DEVEREUX (CONT'D) I send along his pants, shirt, cavalry pin, kerchief, and haircomb."
DAISY (V.O.) Mr. Gateau, done for the night, went up to his bed.
Mr. Gateau, blindly feeling his way up the stairs...
DAISY'S (V.O.) And their son came home.
We see "Mr.
Cake" in his familiar hat, his wife holding his arm, standing among the rows of coffins.
DAISY'S (V.O.) They buried him where the Gateau family had been buried for a hundred and seven years...
An old New Orleans cemetery, vines crawling the sepulchers.
DAISY'S (V.O.) Mr. Cake went back to work on his clock...
DAISY'S (V.O.) laboring to finish...
Mr. Gateau blindly setting the last spring, closing up the clock back...
finished at last.
DAISY'S (V.O.) It was a morning to remember...
DAISY'S (V.O.) Papa said there were people everywhere...
And we see a large throng gathered to watch the unveiling of the clock.
Politicians, citizens, and pickpockets alike...
DAISY'S (V.O.) Even Teddy Roosevelt had come.
And we see the distinctive figure of Theodore Roosevelt, in overcoat and hat, the war heavy on his shoulders.
We watch Mr. Cake, with the aid of an assistant, climbing the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape...
He stands for a moment...
and with a simple tug, releases the purple swath...
People gasp at the magnificent clock...
"Mr.
Cake" winds the clock, which chimes a glorious chime...
Pushed by an angel, the second-hand begins its eternal journey...going around...
Everyone cheers...
until they realize the clock is going the wrong way...
traveling backwards in time...
A man shouts, "It's running backwards!"
MONSIEUR GATEAU I made it this way...
MONSIEUR GATEAU so that perhaps, the boys who were lost in the war might stand and go home again...
And we see just that...
bullets leaving mens' wounds sailing back into the rifles from whence they came...
limbs, whole again...
cannon balls rocketing backwards into the cannons' breech...
Fallen come to their feet, to live and breathe again.
MONSIEUR GATEAU (V.O.) ...
MONSIEUR GATEAU (V.O.) home to farm, to work, have children, to live long, full lives...
Teddy Roosevelt, bereft, removes his hat...
MONSIEUR GATEAU Perhaps, my own son might come home again...
And we see his own son, Martin, once again full of life hopping backward off the train to land where his journey started...
back in the arms of his loving parents...
MONSIEUR GATEAU I'm sorry if I offended anybody.
MONSIEUR GATEAU I hope you enjoy my clock.
And his wife holding his arm, he makes his way across the terminal and exits...
The crowd is motionless.
They look to Teddy Roosevelt for guidance...
but he simply puts his hat on, and with his guardians, is gone...
DAISY'S (V.O.) Mr Cake was never seen again.
DAISY'S (V.O.) Some say he died of a broken heart.
DAISY'S (V.O.) Some say he went to sea...
Mr. Gateau, blindly rowing...
away...
DAISY He just rowed...rowed...away...
The wind loudly rattles the window...they turn to look...
DOROTHY BAKER Do you mind if I make myself a call?
DOROTHY BAKER I've got somebody watching my little boy.
CAROLINE No, please go call...
It's quiet, Caroline sitting on the bed with her dying mother...
with the wind knocking at the window...
After some moments:
CAROLINE (CONT'D) I hope I haven't disappointed you, Mother.
DAISY Oh honey, you could never disappoint me.
CAROLINE I wished I had more to show for myself.
CAROLINE I know you would have liked to have had grandchildren.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) My life hasn't been all that...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) normal...
As if to say the pieces haven't all fit...
trying to articulate it...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) I'm either a step ahead...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) or a step behind...
DAISY What's normal?
DAISY A hat full of sand.
CAROLINE What?
DAISY I need my brown suitcase...
DAISY The envelope...
CAROLINE An envelope?
Caroline doing what she's asked goes over to one of the suitcases by the bed...
She opens it...
and among the clothes and the keepsakes, there is indeed an old envelope.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) This one?
DAISY I tried to read it a hundred different times...
DAISY but I couldn't bring myself...
CAROLINE What do you mean?
DAISY Read it to me.
Daisy closes her eyes...
Caroline takes out a sheath of papers...
It's a journal of some kind written in longhand...
Pages have come undone...
scraps of paper, even some napkins...
DAISY (CONT'D) Just the sound of your voice...
And for her mother's sake she begins to read it...
with no particular interest, like reading to someone a selection from a menu's choices...
CAROLINE It's dated "April 4, 1985."
CAROLINE It says, "New Orleans."
CAROLINE "This is my last will and testament...
CAROLINE I don't have much to leave...
CAROLINE few possessions, no money really...
CAROLINE I will go out of this world the same way I came in, alone and with nothing.
CAROLINE All I have is my story...
CAROLINE I'm writing it now while I still remember it..."
She's interested.
She looks over at her mother.
But her mother's eyes are closed...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "My name is Benjamin..."
And Caroline's voice becomes a young MAN'S voice...
A MAN'S (V.O.) "Benjamin Button...
A MAN'S (V.O.) and I was born under unusual circumstances."
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) The war to end all wars had ended.
We see the streets of New Orleans are filled with drunken, singing revelers...
cars jamming the cobblestones, people kissing, shouting joyful...
Another burst of fireworks.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) I was told it was an especially good night to be born...
And we see in the fireworks' light, a young MAN in his early 30s, THOMAS BUTTON, running up to the gate of a fashionable town home.
He nearly collides with a PRIEST who arrives there at the same time.
Thomas runs past him, up the steps...
...He runs past a solemn Maid and up a long staircase...
barging into the MASTER BEDROOM...
...
where we see a young Woman is lying on a bloody bed, frantically being administered to by a DOCTOR with the help of the small domestic staff...
the PRIEST enters...
THOMAS BUTTON Why are you here?
THE DOCTOR Thomas, I'm afraid she's not going to survive...
And the Priest bends to say last rites over the pretty young woman...
and the maids, bringing bedsheets, futilely start to change her bloody linens...
THOMAS BUTTON That's enough...!
THOMAS BUTTON All of you!
They move out of the way...
and Thomas kneels beside his wife...
She's pale white, fear in her soft brown eyes...
He takes her hand...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I came as quickly as I could...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I'm sorry I took so long, the streets are filled with people...
As if to underscore it, fireworks go off...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) You are going to be alright, my dearest darling...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I will not let anything happen to you...
HIS YOUNG WIFE Promise me, Thomas...
And she is interrupted by the sudden CRY OF A BABY.
But Thomas can't take his eyes from his dying wife...
HIS YOUNG WIFE (CONT'D) Promise me, he has a place...
He doesn't understand...
She looks up at him...
holds his hand tight...
then she slips away...
The Doctor listening for her pulse...
He covers her...
it's quiet...
the Priest's murmured incantations...
the housemaids crying...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She gave her life for me...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And for that I am forever grateful...
Thomas, still holding her hand, is unable to let go...
When we hear again the BABY CRYING...
The BABY'S CRY is not quite right...
It is not an infant's cry for succor, or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs...
It's a deep, haunting cry from some primal soul...
They all turn, and the room stills...
listening as The BABY continues its mournful WAIL.
Only Thomas goes to answer...
The Baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick blanket, its face covered with cloth...
Thomas goes to lift it, to see his son's face...
MAID Mr. Button...!
He lifts the cloth anyway...
He recoils...
for he has seen some kind of horror...
He makes the smallest of sounds, a whispered "Ohhhh."
And then he suddenly snatches up the swaddled baby -- running with it out of the room...
downstairs...
outside...
...
Thomas, tears on his face, carrying his CRYING BABY, through the streets...
Pushing through crowds...
...
he comes along an old bridge over a waterway...
the air heavy with the haze of fireworks...
the water dark...
brokenhearted, he lifts the baby to throw it into the black water...
He is just at the apex of this throw when, despite his sadness, he can't bring himself to do it...
Instead, cradles the newborn...
THOMAS I'm sorry...
THOMAS I'm so sorry...
A LANTERN lights his face...
A POLICEMAN down the way...
POLICEMAN What are you doing there!?
The BABY starts to CRY...
POLICEMAN (CONT'D) What do you have there?
Thomas takes off...
the Policeman after him...
Thomas, carrying the CRYING BABY, running...
Thomas, scuttling with the crying infant through narrow streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the large old moldering antebellum houses...
He comes to an old three-story house with a screened porch, VOICES from inside...
PEOPLE TALKING and LAUGHING...
The Baby, soothed by the soft yellow light, by the music of the voices, by the house itself -- stops its mournful cry.
Thomas stops, catching his breath...
He looks in through the back porch...
the sounds of VOICES coming...
Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back porch steps.
He takes out every last dollar he has, tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket...
We can just see the figures of two people coming from inside...
Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door...
And his decision made, he turns, moving away from the house, leaving his child behind.
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) I could've sworn I heard somebody knockin'...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) When a young Black Woman, in a green dress, comes onto the porch...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) A thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s, with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- She's known as QUEENIE.
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) She's followed by a handsome Black man, MR.
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) WEATHERS -- that everyone calls TIZZY.
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) She looks out the door, and not seeing anything...
QUEENIE I guess not...
QUEENIE She stands for a moment taking in the night air...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) The air smells sweet...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) And she sings to herself...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) a song from the time...
TIZZY You look very handsome tonight, Ms. Queenie, handsome as I ever seen you...
TIZZY The green matches your eyes...
QUEENIE It isn't everyday a war's over, Mr. Weathers...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) We have to mark it somehow...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) You ain't no slouch yourself.
He smiles, tips his hat...
And they stand in the quiet...
TIZZY Hambert's back in town...
TIZZY came home legless, but he home...
TIZZY we're gonna throw a party for him...
TIZZY help get himself situated...
TIZZY I know you was sweet on him one time...
QUEENIE Sweeter than I shoulda been...
QUEENIE Lost his legs you say?
QUEENIE "You never know what's comin' for you."
And if right on cue an older white Woman sticks her head out...
OLD WOMAN Ms. Simone messed herself...
QUEENIE She got to stop doing that, or it's diapers for her...
QUEENIE I'll be right there, Mrs. Jameson...
The woman disappears inside.
Queenie, not anxious to go...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) It sure is nice out here, Mr.
QUEENIE (CONT'D) Weathers...
TIZZY Awful nice, Ms. Queenie...
TIZZY Come out back for a moment...
TIZZY take your mind away from things...
He pushes open the porch screen door...
QUEENIE Just a moment's time...
He offers her his hand...
She takes it...
He backs out of the house, holding her hand, and he suddenly steps right on top of the Baby...
The baby wails, Tizzy stumbles, nearly falls...
TIZZY What in God's name...?!!
QUEENIE What is that?
QUEENIE A fish crawl out of the river...?
She moves to it...
pushes aside the blanket, and freezes.
QUEENIE (CONT'D) God in heaven!
IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY.
What we see is the prominent bald head of any newborn...
but it has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an octogenarian.
Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed old man...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) My Goodness, the Lord did something here...!
TIZZY Look like a milk wagon run over it...
TIZZY three times...
TIZZY and back...
And they're both motionless, not quite sure what to do...
TIZZY (CONT'D) I didn't see it layin' there...
TIZZY (CONT'D) I hope I didn't hurt it none...
TIZZY (CONT'D) steppin' on it like that...
The BABY won't stop its mournful cry...
TIZZY (CONT'D) We best leave it to the police...
TIZZY (CONT'D) I'll go --
Queenie hesitates...
a longing.
QUEENIE It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it...
And making up her mind, she suddenly grabs up the crying baby, taking it inside...
Tizzy, anxiously whispering something, going in after her...
A piano's playing a standard, people singing....
There's a myriad of old dark rooms...
heavy furniture and carpets...
an eclectic mixture of the possessions of those who have lived and died here over many years...
and we see a parlor is crowded with Old People, from sixty to ninety-five, in various stages of health...
various contraptions to keep them "afloat".
An Old Age Home.
We see Queenie moving quietly along a hallway, carrying the crying baby so as not to be seen.
Tizzy, following her, still anxiously whispering after her...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) Where are you, Queenie...?
QUEENIE Hold your water...
QUEENIE Go see to them.
He does what she asks.
She hurries the baby into a small room, literally like a mouse house, under the stairs...
A small room tucked under the staircase...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) Queenie Apple...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) she went and messed herself all over again...
QUEENIE Jane Childress start her a bath...
QUEENIE and mind your business, Mrs.
QUEENIE Duprey...
QUEENIE You'll be messing yourself soon enough too!
There's a KNOCK on Queenie's door.
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) Somebody stole my necklace...
QUEENIE I'll be right with you, Mrs.
QUEENIE Hollister...
She whispers to The Baby, soothing it.
And looking for a place to put it, she opens a dresser drawer...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) You may be as ugly as an old pot...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) but you still a child of God...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) Queenie, Apple...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) she won't go take a bath wit'out you...
QUEENIE Mercy, I'll be right there.
And with that she puts The Baby into the top dresser drawer...
with her unmentionables...
and shuts it...
leaving it open just a crack, enough to breathe...
Turning, she sees an Old Woman, looking very lost, looking in the room...
MRS. HOLLISTER My sister gave those pearls to me...
MRS. HOLLISTER I can't find them anywhere...
MRS. HOLLISTER People are stealing my jewelry...!
QUEENIE They're right here, Mrs.
QUEENIE Hollister, right 'round your pretty white neck...
QUEENIE Come on now...
There's a sound of a door chime...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) Dr. Rose has arrived for his visit...
Queenie takes a concerned look back at the Baby, and closes the door...
And we stay behind for a moment...
inside Queenie's underwear drawer, with the smell of a lilac sachet...
is the Baby with the face of an old man...
looking up at the sliver of light coming into the dresser drawer...
We see the Doctor, an older man in a tired suit, who has done this longer than he cares to remember, finishing examining one of the elderly boarders.
He puts his things into his doctor's bag.
Queenie comes beside him, saying something...
The Baby is lying on Queenie's bed...
Dr. Rose, stethoscope ever dangling, washes his hands in a sink.
DOCTOR ROSE ...
DOCTOR ROSE He's nearly blind from cataracts...
DOCTOR ROSE I'm not sure he can hear...
DOCTOR ROSE His bones indicate severe arthritis...
DOCTOR ROSE His skin has lost all elasticity...
DOCTOR ROSE His hands and feet are ossified...
DOCTOR ROSE He has all the deterioration, the infirmities, not of a newborn, but of a man well in his eighties on the way to his grave...
QUEENIE You mean to say he's dying?
DOCTOR ROSE Of old age.
DOCTOR ROSE His body is failing him before his life's begun.
They're still, looking at the strange baby.
DOCTOR ROSE (CONT'D) Where did he come from?
QUEENIE It's my sister's child...
QUEENIE From Lafayette.
QUEENIE She had an unfortunate adventure.
QUEENIE The poor child got the worse of it...
QUEENIE came out white...
DOCTOR ROSE There are places for 'unwanted' babies like these, Queenie...
DOCTOR ROSE There's no room for another mouth to feed here...
DOCTOR ROSE The Nolan Foundation, despite their good intentions, thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is...
DOCTOR ROSE A baby here --
QUEENIE You said he don't have long.
DOCTOR ROSE Queenie -- some creatures aren't meant to survive.
She looks at the Baby, determined.
QUEENIE He is a miracle, that's for certain...
QUEENIE just not the kind of miracle one hopes to see...
The Old People are sitting around the parlor talking, playing cards...
Queenie brings the baby bundle into the room.
QUEENIE You all listen...
And they stop what they are doing...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) We have a visitor that will be staying with us for a little while...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) My sister had a child but couldn't see right by it...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) He's known as...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) Benjamin...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) Benjamin...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) He's not a well child...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) so we need to take very good care of him...
We see Tizzy's come out of the kitchen , watching with an air of strong disapproval...
And an OLD WOMAN says...
ONE OF THE WOMEN I had ten children...
ONE OF THE WOMEN there's not a baby I can't care for...
ONE OF THE WOMEN let me see him...
Queenie hesitates, and gives the Baby to her...
The Old Woman pushes the blanket back from the baby's face...
THE OLD WOMAN God in heaven, he looks just like my ex-husband...
And there's laughter...
QUEENIE He's prematurely old...
QUEENIE Doctor Rose said he don't have much time on this earth...
A MAN Join the club.
They all laugh.
Their laughter makes the baby seem to smile...
the lonely smile of an old, dying man.
We see Queenie, unable to sleep, lying in bed, looking out a small window...
there's a light KNOCK on the door...
Tizzy...
TIZZY Hambert sends his remembrance to you.
She nods...
The baby cries out...
and then it's quiet...
TIZZY (CONT'D) Are you right out of your mind?
TIZZY (CONT'D) I know you don't got all the parts it takes to make one of your own...
TIZZY (CONT'D) but this isn't yours to keep...
TIZZY (CONT'D) this isn't even human kind...
With nothing left to be said, he starts to go...
QUEENIE Mr. Weathers.
QUEENIE Stay with me tonight.
He slows.
She's quiet.
And she whispers:
QUEENIE (CONT'D) "You never know what's comin' for you."
And as they move to be with one another, to make love; we look over at the dresser drawer -- open just a crack...
Benjamin lying among the unmentionables, looking out at the world...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I found a home...
Caroline with the "journal" on her knees.
Daisy, eyes closed...
the wind gathered in strength...
furiously knocking...
CAROLINE Is any of this true?
DAISY You have such a lovely voice.
Caroline shrugs.
She looks through the "book..."
CAROLINE Some pages seem to be torn out here...
She discovers inside...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) There's an old streetcar token.
She gives it to her mother, folding her hand around it.
But Daisy is somewhere else, looking out the window...
DAISY That clock...
DAISY Just kept going, year after year after year...
And we see "Mr.
Cake's" clock with its cherubs pushing the "hands of progress," still marking time backwards...
The year is now, "1925..."
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "...I didn't know I was a child.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I thought I was like everyone else who lived there, an old man, in my "golden years."
The boarders eating dinner.
Queenie, in a white uniform...
along with Tizzy, wearing a chef's hat and apron, helping her serve.
We move across the ancient faces...
until we come to one particular face...
Wearing eyeglasses now...
but the same wrinkled face we've come to know...
the face of a very old man...
The face of Benjamin Button, when he should normally be a six-year-old.
He's sitting in a wheelchair now...
small, shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with arthritis...
Eyeglasses are just one addition...
a hearing aid...
a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one ear...
But if we look even closer we can see there are sprouts of hair...
wisps of white...
what would be the last hair for some...
seem to be growing in...
As we watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might, banging it just for the hell of it making noise...
QUEENIE Stop bangin' that fork...
QUEENIE It's for eating, not for playin' with...
QUEENIE And use your napkin, please Mr. Benjamin...
And he does as he's told...
A staff member helps one of the old men, feeding him...
Benjamin just another old man having dinner with his contemporaries.
A line of old people in rockers.
Benjamin, like any six- year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between them...
until one of the oldsters, who has had enough, sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making him come to an abrupt stop...
Benjamin, sitting with the other oldsters on the porch...
the old people rocking...
Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall...
children playing...
people talking...
BENJAMIN BUTTON What's there?
Nobody says anything, rocking.
Benjamin, eternally curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall is lower and he just sees the street...
children running on the street, playing...
carriages dropping people off for a party...
He leans forward to get an even better view...
When Queenie suddenly grabs him...
QUEENIE Benjamin!
QUEENIE That's dangerous...
QUEENIE Come back here...!
...Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the safety of the old people...
out of sight of the street...
The small room with the small window.
We see Benjamin in a bed made on the floor...
Queenie in her bed...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I loved her very much.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She was my mother.
And he reaches to hold her hand.
She generously takes his hand...
And they lay like that holding hands, Queenie in bed, her "son", the "old man" on the floor...
BENJAMIN BUTTON Somedays I feel like I'm different from the day before...
QUEENIE Everybody feels different about themselves one way or another.
QUEENIE We're all goin' the same way, just taking different roads to get there...
QUEENIE You're on your own road, Benjamin.
BENJAMIN BUTTON How much longer do I have to live, Mother?
QUEENIE Just be thankful you got what you're given.
QUEENIE You already here longer than you supposed to be.
We see the door quietly open, Tizzy coming in...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Some nights, I would have to sleep alone.
He looks at Benjamin, his signal to pick him up, carrying him out of the room, sitting him in his wheelchair, Tizzy going back down into the room to be with Queenie...
shutting the door...
An Old Woman's fallen fast asleep in an easy chair, a book on her lap.
Benjamin sitting alone in his wheelchair, listening to the sounds of the house.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I didn't mind.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I would listen to the house breathing.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) All the people sleeping.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I felt safe.
Be he still wants to know "What's over there?" He wheels himself over to sit at the window looking outside...
looking at the streetlights, the world beyond the gate...
trying to see what's dangerous...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was a place of great routine...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Every morning at 5:30, no matter the weather...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) General Winslow, U.S.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Army Retired...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) raised the flag...
And we see the very elderly General Winslow, doing just that...
raising the flag in a downpour, only...
he's naked.
And as Queenie comes running across the lawn with a coat for him.
There's the sound of SOMEONE SINGING
BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.) Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once a noted opera singer...
BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.) well, she'd sing, Wagner...
We see a Victrola playing, Mrs. Wagner in her nightgown at a window singing with the musical accompaniment at the top of her lungs...
while, down the hall we see Queenie giving Benjamin a bath...
massaging his poor crippled legs...
QUEENIE We're gonna put some life into these old sticks for you...
QUEENIE get you walkin'...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Breakfast was served promptly at six.
We see Benjamin in his wheelchair, under Tizzy's tutelage, learning to cook...
and simultaneously, to read...
TIZZY How we doin'?
TIZZY What's that say there?
BENJAMIN Bis...
TIZZY Biscuits...
TIZZY and...
BENJAMIN Graby...
TIZZY Think.
TIZZY That's a 'v' not a 'b.' Say it.
BENJAMIN Gravy.
TIZZY Now you talkin'!
Some staff come in getting platters of food...
TIZZY (CONT'D) How many parts butter we got?
BENJAMIN Four...
TIZZY How many parts flour?
BENJAMIN Two...
TIZZY How much is four and two?
BENJAMIN Six.
Tizzy smacks the back of his head.
TIZZY You're a regular addin' machine...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Dinner was served promptly at six.
Tizzy washing dishes...Benjamin working with him...
putting away cans...
reading from one of the labels...
BENJAMIN Tomato, brown sugar, salt, myasses...
Tizzy swats at him with his dish towel...
TIZZY "Molasses"...
And while washing the dishes...
TIZZY (CONT'D) I learned to read when I was five.
TIZZY (CONT'D) My grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor.
TIZZY (CONT'D) He'd bring home every play for me to read.
TIZZY (CONT'D) "Kind keepers of my weak decaying age, Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
TIZZY (CONT'D) Even like a man new haled from the rack.
TIZZY (CONT'D) So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.
TIZZY (CONT'D) And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death, Nestor-like aged in an age of care, Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer."
Benjamin's mouth agape, awed, taken by him, his majesty.
TIZZY (CONT'D) You thought I was plain ignorant, didn't you?
Benjamin never thought about it...
TIZZY (CONT'D) The actor my grandfather worked for was John Wilkes Booth.
TIZZY (CONT'D) He killed Abraham Lincoln.
TIZZY (CONT'D) You never know...
An old man looks in...
A MAN When's dessert...?
TIZZY When it's served.
TIZZY Now sit your wrinkly butt back down, Mr. Lee.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) On Saturday nights I would go to Queenie's church...
A sweltering shout 'em up Negro gospel tent.
Queenie pushes Benjamin in his wheelchair past a line of people looking to be healed, bringing him face to face with a mountain of a PREACHER, pouring sweat and full of fire...
THE PREACHER What can I do for you, Sister?
And Queenie whispers something to him.
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) Her parts are all twisted up inside so she can't have little children...
He puts his hand on her stomach...
PREACHER Lord, if you could see clear to forgive this woman her sins so she can bear the fruit of the womb.
PREACHER Out damnable affliction!
He presses on her stomach...
making Queenie nearly fall over...
held up by a "NURSE" in a crisp white uniform.
And once she's regained her balance...
THE PREACHER And what's this old man's irrediction?
QUEENIE He's got the devil on his back...
QUEENIE trying to ride him into the grave before his time...
THE PREACHER Out, Zebuchar!
THE PREACHER Out, Beelzebub!
THE PREACHER How old are you?
And he says what is only true.
BENJAMIN I'm seven, but I look a lot older.
PREACHER God bless you.
PREACHER He's seven!
The congregation laughs...
THE PREACHER This is a man who has optimism in his heart!
THE PREACHER Belief in his soul!
THE PREACHER We are all children in the eyes of God.
THE PREACHER Now we are going to get you out of that chair...
THE PREACHER we're gonna have you walk...
THE PREACHER In the name of God's glory, rise up!
And Benjamin, doing what he's asked, barely able to, his legs akimbo, stands...
The people all applaud...
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) Now God is going to see you the rest of the way...
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) He's going to see this little old man walk without the use of a crutch or a cane...!
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) He's going walk by himself on faith and divine inspiration alone...!
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) We'll show that Devil where to go...!
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) Walk on...!
And Benjamin takes two very precarious steps and his poor arthritic legs give out...
and he sprawls to the floor...
The Aides in white nurse's uniforms move to help, but:
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) Don't touch him!
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) Rise up, old man!
But Benjamin stays crumpled on the floor...
The Preacher comes to his feet, standing like a mountain over him...
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) Rise up like Lazarus!
Benjamin still lies on the floor...
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) I said rise up!!
And Benjamin, slowly but surely, makes his way to his feet...
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) Yes, and say hallelujah!
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) Now walk, my old friend...
THE PREACHER (CONT'D) Walk on...!
And Benjamin, one crippled leg at a time, hobbles across the stage...
The people urging him on...
a string of "Hallelujahs...!" Queenie comes to join him...
urging him...
QUEENIE Let the Lord carry you...
QUEENIE ...
...The Preacher, walking along with him, more a dance than a walk, shouting the name of the Lord...
Queenie and The Preacher walking Benjamin across the stage...
Benjamin making it to the other end...
to a roar of "Amens"!
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Now, when I look back on it, it was kind of miraculous...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) But you know the saying, "...the Lord Giveth and the Lord Taketh away..."
...
That mountain of a Preacher...
in full exaltation to God...
THE PREACHER Praise be to the Lord on the highest...!
Suddenly pitches over, flat on his face...
Having had a spontaneous coronary...
lying center-stage, deader than the proverbial doornail...
The crisp uniformed "nurses" running to attend to him, and poor "old" Benjamin haplessly looking around.
The people are gathered...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) There were birthdays...
A lit cake is being brought in celebrating General Winslow's birthday.
He stares at the cake, unhappily gets up, mutters something...
and leaves.
The oldsters eye the cake, and without a moment's hesitation, dig in...
BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.) And mortality was a common visitor to our house...
BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.) People came and went...
BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.) Death was so frequent, I was never afraid of it.
Mrs. Wagner's window open...
and not a sound coming out...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) You could hear when someone left us...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) there was a silence in the house...
A small funeral at an old cemetery...
And while "DIE VALKYRIE" PLAYS on her crank VICTROLA, an old man bangs cymbals as a grand finale to the music...
while we see SYBIL WAGNER, laid to rest to sing in another choir:
Benjamin with his wondrous ancient face sitting in his wheelchair with the old people on the porch...
watching the sun go down...
BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.) It was a wonderful place to grow up.
BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.) I was with people who had put away all the inconsequences of life, left in a state of purely being...wondering about the weather...the temperature of a bath...the light at the end of the day...
BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.) And one of them, as if to underscore the point, farts...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) For everyone that died, someone would come to take their place...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And we see Benjamin coming into the kitchen...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Tizzy busy preparing lunch...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Benjamin stops, seeing a tiny African man, his back to us, surrounded by old people standing on the lawn...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) He hears him telling them...
NGUNDA OTI ...
NGUNDA OTI My first wife and I are captured by neighbor tribe, cannibals...
NGUNDA OTI The old people shrink at the mention...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) I escaped across the river...
AN OLD WOMAN You escaped cannibals?
NGUNDA OTI My wife, she can't swim, so she eaten.
TIZZY That's Mr. Oti...
TIZZY He's an acquaintance of an acquaintance of mine...he'll be stayin' with us in the staff quarters for awhile...
NGUNDA OTI ...Second wife stepped on viper and dies...
NGUNDA OTI (jocular) It was bad luck to be married to Mr. Oti.
NGUNDA OTI They laugh.
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) I am captured with six others by Baschiele tribe.
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) They sell us to a big white man...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) He instinctively turns and sees Benjamin standing in the window watching him.
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) When Mr. Oti spots him he quickly moves out of the window out of sight.
We see Benjamin lying on the floor by the stairs playing with some metal army men...
when Mr. Oti's distinctive laugh, his voice, drifts up from under the stairs...
Benjamin, getting his canes, goes to look...
Mr. Oti, standing under the stairs in an alcove with some of the help, telling them his life story...
but it's a completely different tone...
a mockery of white people and their insanity...
NGUNDA OTI The Big White Man brings us to St.
NGUNDA OTI Louis, where they make our village at the 1904 World's Fair...
NGUNDA OTI They have us livin' in these little huts like we're livin' in Africa...
NGUNDA OTI people behind bars staring at us...
NGUNDA OTI we told not to look at them...
NGUNDA OTI to just go about our normal lives...
NGUNDA OTI what the hell they talkin' about...
NGUNDA OTI They all laugh...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) At night we're done bein' "savages..."
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) we go over the wall into The Rosebud...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) we drank and laughed until the sun come up...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) and then we savages again...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) They nod enjoying the idea...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) And as Mr. Oti senses Benjamin's presence, turning...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) Benjamin retreating on his canes as fast as he can back up the stairs...
Benjamin sitting at the dining room table reading an oversized book of "Imaginary Beings..."
He senses a presence...
and Mr. Oti sits down across from him.
NGUNDA OTI I hear you not so old as you looking.
NGUNDA OTI You just foolin' everybody.
NGUNDA OTI What happen, you get Madjembe?
BENJAMIN What's a madjembe?
NGUNDA OTI Worms.
BENJAMIN I don't think so.
BENJAMIN This is just how I am.
BENJAMIN Mr. Oti looks out at the street.
NGUNDA OTI You want to get a cold root beer?
BENJAMIN It's dangerous.
NGUNDA OTI Who said that?
NGUNDA OTI He gets up ready to go.
NGUNDA OTI Benjamin hesitates.
NGUNDA OTI He can see Queenie busy leaning out a window banging dust from a rug.
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) ...Come on little man...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) Despite knowing the consequences he takes up his canes and follows Ngunda outside...
They come outside.
Children on the street playing.
Seeing Benjamin, they come to a dead stop...
staring at the freak from the old people's home, with another freak...
Mr. Oti suddenly runs into the street...
NGUNDA OTI Hurry...
NGUNDA OTI Benjamin tries as best he can to keep up...
NGUNDA OTI Mr. Oti darts directly in front of a street car, waving his arms, making it come to an abrupt stop...
NGUNDA OTI (OVER) (CONT'D) ...Another white man come to my country and say he want to talk to me...
We move along the aisle of a streetcar...
the various people...
NGUNDA OTI Then I am in the monkey house at "Philadelphia Zoological Park."
NGUNDA OTI Three thousand people show up my first day...
NGUNDA OTI Benjamin and Ngunda siting in the back of the streetcar behind a moveable metal bar that has "Coloreds" painted on it...
NGUNDA OTI Mr. Oti taking a slug from a flask...
NGUNDA OTI A group of school children nearby can't take their eyes off the two of them...
NGUNDA OTI Mr. Oti takes his wallet out, taking out a folded piece of newspaper, showing it to Benjamin...
NGUNDA OTI "Bushman shares cage with park apes."
BENJAMIN What's it like living in a cage?
NGUNDA OTI It stinks.
NGUNDA OTI The monkeys, they do some tricks...
NGUNDA OTI I throw spear...
NGUNDA OTI I wrestle with Kowali, she is orangutan...
NGUNDA OTI They have me file my teeth like a cannibal...
NGUNDA OTI He shows him his teeth filed into points like a cannibal...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) When I'm not playing with monkeys - - they want me to run to bars in my cage with teeth to scare little children...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) And he suddenly jumps up and does just that, charging with his teeth bared at the school children...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) They scream...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) Mr. Oti, taking his seat again, laughs with Benjamin...
Benjamin, ecstatic, his head out the streetcar window, Mr. Oti holding onto the back of his breeches from falling...
Benjamin feeling the wind and the city wash over him...
Benjamin and Mr. Oti sitting on a bench at the peristyle of a park.
Benjamin takes his first slug of a coca cola, taking too big a hit, the coke pouring out of his nose...
Mr. Oti gives him a handkerchief...
after he's wiped himself up...
BENJAMIN Why didn't you go back home?
NGUNDA OTI War between English and Dutch people had broken up kingdom.
BENJAMIN What did you do?
NGUNDA OTI I leave zoo.
NGUNDA OTI Go here.
NGUNDA OTI Go there.
NGUNDA OTI Everything okay.
NGUNDA OTI But I alone.
BENJAMIN You were all alone?
NGUNDA OTI You'll see little man, plenty times you be alone.
NGUNDA OTI You different like us, it's gonna be that way.
NGUNDA OTI But I tell you a little secret I find out.
NGUNDA OTI We know we alone.
NGUNDA OTI Fat people, skinny people, tall people, white people...
NGUNDA OTI they just as alone as us...
NGUNDA OTI But they scared shitless...
He smiles a knowing smile...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) Not a thing wrong with being alone...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) no sir...
He looks out...
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) I think about the river I grew up on.
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) It would be good to sit by my river again.
He looks at his watch.
He suddenly gets up...
Mr. Oti and Benjamin coming along the street, music pouring out...
They reach a corner where a tall octoroon woman is waiting.
She broadly smiles seeing Mr. Oti.
THE WOMAN There's my little man.
THE WOMAN You ready, sugar.
NGUNDA OTI Always ready.
NGUNDA OTI Always ready.
NGUNDA OTI Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.
FILAMENA GILEA It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir.
NGUNDA OTI You can find your own way home, can't you?
Although he's not sure he can...
he nods, yes.
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) The St.
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) Charles Avenue line to Napoleon...
And with that, his arm around Filamena's waist, the two of them laughing, walk off...
Benjamin's left standing on the street corner...
he looks around to get his bearings...
he moves along Bourbon Street...
A streetcar comes along, bell clanging, it rushes by him...
he watches it go...
Clasping his canes, determined, he starts walking...
bent over, one cane after the other...
making his way along the street...
We see Benjamin coming back to the gate...
and we hear:
QUEENIE (V.O.) Where in God's name have you been?!!
And we see Queenie standing on the porch...
She's worried sick...
she sees his hands are bleeding from blisters.
Queenie cleaning his hands...
QUEENIE Like to scare the Holy Hell out of me!
QUEENIE I was so worried about you...you take my breath away...
BENJAMIN (V.O.) It had been the best day of my life.
And the "caregiver," Dorothy Baker, comes back in.
She feels Daisy's pulse, straightens her pillow...
DOROTHY BAKER How's her breathing...
CAROLINE Shallow.
Dorothy nods.
DOROTHY BAKER They're sayin' it's gonna reach us late in the day...
DOROTHY BAKER I'm goin' to get my baby and take him to my sister's...
DOROTHY BAKER they said there's nothin' to worry about here in the hospital...Nurses are right here if you need them...I'll see you in about an hour if that'll be okay...
CAROLINE No, that's fine...please...
She leaves.
It's momentarily quiet, the wind knocking at the window...
Daisy, ruminating...
DAISY Was there just company?
CAROLINE Dorothy had to go home...
But Daisy's mind is elsewhere...gesturing for her to keep reading...
DAISY Caroline...
Caroline looks back at the book.
Daisy closes her eyes...
CAROLINE "On Sundays the families would come and visit...
The boarders on the lawn with their loved ones...
And we * see an OLD MAN, walking with the aid of a cane coming out * of the house onto the lawn...
And as he moves through the * people we see it's Benjamin...
He has a single cane, * standing more upright now, a distinctive shock of white hair, eyebrows...
A distinguished looking man in his * seventies, or, in normal years, a growing twelve-year-old boy...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It was Thanksgiving 1930, I met the person who changed my life forever.
A chauffeured car has stopped...
A Man is standing in the road, looking at the house through the gates...
And we realize it's THOMAS BUTTON...
looking for a glimpse of his son...
Benjamin instinctively turns, but it's too late, his father's back in the car, being driven away...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) Well, Benjamin...
He turns, an older woman nearby...
BENJAMIN * (politely) * Why, good day Mrs. Fuller...
GRANDMA FULLER * Might I say you are looking * strikingly youthful...a single * cane, your back as straight as an * arrow...
GRANDMA FULLER * what elixir have you been * drinking?
He laughs...And there's a voice that cuts through the * day...
A LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE * Grandma, look at me...
Benjamin, and Grandma Fuller turn to see a little girl, * no more than eight, standing on a picnic table top doing * pirouettes, one after another, for an admiring group of * old people...she full curtsies, bowing --the way dancers * do head to chest...
then raising her head, laughing...
GRANDMA FULLER * Now that was really something...
GRANDMA FULLER * * Come on over here, you...
GRANDMA FULLER * This is * my granddaughter Daisy...
GRANDMA FULLER * This is * Mr...
GRANDMA FULLER * Benjamin, I'm afraid I don't * rightly know your last name...
BENJAMIN Benjamin is just fine...
38. I would never, the rest of my * life, forget those blue eyes...
And with great dignity - *
TIZZY * (calling to all) * Good people, Supper is soived.
The families, along with Ngunda and Filamena, are gathered in the dining room, their heads bowed in prayer.
We see Daisy across from Benjamin...
The prayer's finished, it's noisy...
NGUNDA OTI We pray to Bembe...
NGUNDA OTI the creator of all living things...
NGUNDA OTI she retired after all that work...
DAISY Did you know turkeys aren't really birds...?
BENJAMIN Why do you say that?
DAISY They're in the pheasant family.
DAISY They can hardly fly.
DAISY It's sad don't you think?
DAISY A bird, that can't fly.
NGUNDA OTI I like birds that can't fly.
NGUNDA OTI They're easy to eat.
QUEENIE I have something to tell you all...
They're quiet.
QUEENIE (CONT'D) While we're giving thanks for God's blessings...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) I've had a miracle happen.
QUEENIE (CONT'D) The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.
The people applaud the good news.
BENJAMIN What does she mean "answered her prayers?"
DAISY She's going to have a baby, silly.
DAISY That's what my mother said when I was going to have a little brother.
DAISY He didn't live long though.
DAISY He didn't breathe right...
And we can see Benjamin's heart beginning to break...
he looks over, Tizzy, proudly smiling...
And as Queenie accepts congratulations...
Benjamin's old wrinkled face, watching her...
looks like he's going to cry...
We see an ABSTRACT BLACK AND WHITE DRAWING.
And we hear a woman's voice...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo at five in the afternoon...
AN OLD FINGER comes in pointing to a drawing.
We see * Benjamin and Daisy, sitting close together on a sofa, and * Daisy's grandmother, arm encircling them, is reading to * them from Rudyard Kipling's "Just So Stories."
GRANDMA FULLER * You can tell it's late, because of * the shadow here...
Benjamin and Daisy sitting rapt while she finishes * reading to them...
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) It's the time Old Man Kangaroo got * his beautiful hind legs just as...
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) * I hope I'm saying this right...
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) * just as Big God Ngog had promised.
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) * You can see that it's five * o'clock, because Big God Ngog's * pet tame clock says so.
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) * (finishing) Isn't that something?
Both Daisy and Benjamin, thrilled, say: "Again.
Read it * again."
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) Alright, once more...
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) but * afterwards (forgetting Benjamin's * age) both of you must promise to * go to bed...
They both "I promise..."
And as she starts to read all * over again...
We see Benjamin asleep in bed with one of the Old Men, MR.
DAWS.
The door opens.
And Daisy, in her nightgown, has come inside...
she slightly touches Benjamin...
DAISY Are you sleeping?
He shakes "no."
DAISY (CONT'D) Come on...
She moves quickly out of the room and Benjamin gets up, and with the aid of his cane, follows her...
The old house still.
Daisy, moving quietly down the stairs.
Benjamin, his cane softly thumping the steps, following her.
BENJAMIN Where are we going?
She doesn't say anything.
She leads him into the DINING ROOM...
where we see the wash has been draped, sheets and pillowcases, like ghosts over the dining room table, and a smaller side table, and a buffet...to dry...
DAISY Under here...
And she ducks under a sheet, beneath the dining table...
Benjamin follows her into the "fort..."
DAISY (CONT'D) Nobody knows about this but us.
They sit...
The little girl, and the old man with the maturity of a ten year old boy, enjoying their secret lair...
She takes a candle out of the folds of her nightgown...
She tries to light it, but doesn't really know how to use matches...
DAISY (CONT'D) Will you light it?
BENJAMIN I'm not supposed to use matches...
DAISY Don't be chicken...
Despite his caution, he lights the candle...
the candlelight making it feel more secret...
DAISY (CONT'D) I'll tell you a secret then you tell me one...
DAISY (CONT'D) I saw mommy kissing another man.
DAISY (CONT'D) Her face was red from it.
Benjamin doesn't know what to say.
DAISY (CONT'D) Your turn to tell.
BENJAMIN I'm younger than I look.
DAISY You don't seem like an old person...
DAISY like my grandma...
DAISY Are you sick?
BENJAMIN I heard Tizzy and my mother whisper.
BENJAMIN They said I was going to die soon.
BENJAMIN But I fooled them so far.
Daisy looks at him in the flickering candlelight.
DAISY You are different than anybody I have ever met.
DAISY Can I?
She innocently reaches to touch the skin on his cheek to see what it feels like...
When suddenly a sheet is pulled back and Daisy's grandmother is standing there.
GRANDMA FULLER What are you doing under there?
GRANDMA FULLER Who's idea was this candle?
She angrily blows it out...
and...
to Daisy...
taking her by the arm...
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) It's after midnight, you come right out here and get back up to bed...!
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) You are not to be playing together!
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) Play with people your own age...!
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) Now, you come back to bed, young lady...!
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) You're too young to be wandering around in the night by yourself...
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) You should be ashamed of yourself!
And they're gone...
Benjamin left sitting along under the sheets.
There's a slight sound and he sees Queenie, in her nightgown, standing in the doorway...
QUEENIE You are a different child...
QUEENIE a man child.
QUEENIE People aren't going to understand how different you are.
BENJAMIN What's wrong with me, Mother?
QUEENIE God hasn't said yet.
QUEENIE Now, back to bed and behave yourself.
He crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane, and Mr. Oti, like a spectre, is sitting on one end of the back steps smoking a cigarette, drinking form his flask.
He looks at Benjamin as he goes by.
NGUNDA OTI You get used to it...
QUEENIE (V.O.) You get back in that bed or I'll cane your old ass!
Benjamin turns down the hallway and slips into the bedroom --
Benjamin climbing back into bed with the Old Man.
Turning his back to the old man.
And Mr. Daws, unable to sleep...
MR. DAWS Did I ever tell you I've been struck by lightning seven times.
MR. DAWS Once, when I was fixing a leak on the roof.
And we see just that, the old man on a roof getting blasted.
MR. DAWS (CONT'D) Once, when I was crossing the road to get the mail...
And we see that, the man peacefully crossing a country road to get the mail, getting hit by lightning...
But Benjamin just lays there looking out the window...
all he can think about...
despite everything...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I never forgot her blue eyes...
The words linger.
Daisy, her extraordinary blue eyes, lying on her death bed...
the rattle of the window in the wind...
CAROLINE Are you alright, Mother?
She nods "yes."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) This man.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) He loved you from the first time he saw you.
She doesn't say anything.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Nobody has ever loved me that way.
DAISY Go on.
CAROLINE He crossed out something...
CAROLINE and then he's written...
CAROLINE "When..."
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "...When the baby came things were different..."
We see Benjamin in his pajamas, quietly coming into the kitchen for something to eat...
And he slows, seeing Queenie, taking a moment to herself, sitting at the kitchen table, peacefully breast-feeding her infant...
as Benjamin slips back out unseen, closing the door after him...
We see Benjamin lying on a small bed in the ATTIC...
cluttered with years of accumulated things...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I moved into my own room in the attic...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I realized, despite a house filled with people that I loved, I was alone...
There's a noise.
And we see Ngunda Oti is at the door, a suitcase in hand.
NGUNDA OTI I come to say goodbye.
NGUNDA OTI I'm going away.
BENJAMIN Going away?
BENJAMIN Where?
NGUNDA OTI I don't figure that out yet.
NGUNDA OTI I will send you a postcard when I get to there.
BENJAMIN What about your friend?
BENJAMIN The tall lady?
NGUNDA OTI We're not friends anymore.
NGUNDA OTI That's what happens with tall people.
He starts to go...
BENJAMIN Goodbye...
And he's gone.
Benjamin gets up going to the window.
He looks outside.
He can see Mr. Oti come onto the porch.
There's a full moon.
And as he walks off, his arrogant little walk, suitcase in hand, going out the gate, Benjamin watches him disappear into the night.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I spent a lot of time by myself that year...
Benjamin sitting at a table, an old man to look at but no more than twelve, busy playing with magnets...
BENJAMIN (V.O) Until...
We see a refined, genteel OLD WOMAN, wearing a hat and gloves, a suitcase at her feet, flanked by an old DOG, just inside the front door...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Hello...
THE WOMAN I'm moving in today.
And just then Queenie appears, the baby on her hip...
QUEENIE Welcome...
QUEENIE we was expecting you...
QUEENIE Could you show her upstairs?
QUEENIE (CONT'D) She will be staying in Mrs.
QUEENIE (CONT'D) Rousseau's old room.
QUEENIE (CONT'D) I'll be right with you with some fresh towels...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) We don't usually let dogs in the house.
THE WOMAN He's as old as the hills.
THE WOMAN Blind too.
THE WOMAN Can hardly get around, he won't be a bother much longer.
Benjamin, like any young boy, immediately pets the old dog...
QUEENIE I guess as long as he stays out from underfoot.
Benjamin helps her with her bags showing her up the stairs...the old dog dutifully following them...
BENJAMIN I'm Benjamin...
The woman starts to tell him her name...
but we don't hear it because...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) As hard as I try, I can't remember her name.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Hartford, or maybe it was Maple?
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It's funny how sometimes the people we remember the least, make the greatest impression on us.
Benjamin sits petting the dog while the Woman puts her things away...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I remember she wore diamonds...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) and she always dressed in fine clothing as if she was going out.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Although, she never did and nobody would ever come to visit her.
We see the Woman dressed nicely, sitting in a chair reading a book.
She takes a look out the window at the families on the lawn and bends back to her book.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) ...She taught me how to play the piano...
The Woman sitting with Benjamin teaching him how to play piano...playing a classical piece like Chopin...Benjamin trying his hand...sounding pretty bad...
THE WOMAN It isn't how well you play, it's how you feel about what you're playing.
THE WOMAN (whispers) Try this.
And she plays a ragtime piece...New Orleans music...music for the other whole part of the soul...
Benjamin tries his hand and actually plays it fairly well
THE WOMAN (CONT'D) You cannot help but put your entire self into the music.
And he plays along with her...a piece he won't soon forget...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) There were many changes going on, some you could see...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) some you couldn't.
We see Benjamin taking a bath.
An he notices a single gray hair floating on the surface...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Hair, had started growing, in all sorts of places...
And he sees some hair is under his arms...
and as he looks downward...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Along with other things...
Benjamin, naked, looking at himself in a mirror...
like a young teenage boy...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) I felt like I could do anything, that I could sprout wings...
And as he flexes his muscles, feeling like a man.
It's started to rain, the wind blowing, splattering rain against the window.
Knocking.
DAISY Oh, darlin', the pain...
CAROLINE I'll get the nurse...
She hurries out of the room.
Daisy looks out the window.
The maelstrom of wind and rain.
Caroline comes back with a Nurse.
THE NURSE You're not feeling too good?
She adjusts the morphine drip.
Daisy lays back.
THE NURSE (CONT'D) Nobody seems to know whether to stay or leave.
THE NURSE (CONT'D) The roads are filled from New Orleans to Baton Rouge already.
THE NURSE (CONT'D) I think I'm gonna ride it out.
THE NURSE (CONT'D) There, that should make things easier.
Daisy starts to feel the effects of the drip...
THE NURSE (CONT'D) Have you had a chance to say your goodbyes?
Caroline nods.
The Nurse nods.
THE NURSE (CONT'D) My father waited four hours for my brother to get here from Boger City.
THE NURSE (CONT'D) He couldn't go without him.
She affectionately touches Daisy's cheek.
THE NURSE (CONT'D) She seems like a sweet woman.
Caroline nods.
CAROLINE I haven't spent as much time as I would have like with her the last few years.
Another NURSE looks in...
THE WOMAN You busy?
The Nurse quickly goes out of the room.
Caroline sits back down looking at her mother...Daisy opens her eyes...
they look at each other...
Caroline knowing Daisy wants to hear the sound of her voice...
CAROLINE The next page says...
Daisy shuts her eyes...
BENJAMIN (V.O.) ...Queenie would let me go with Mr. Daws to Bridge City..To watch the boats go up and down the river...
The busy docks...
Men waiting, hoping to find work...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) These were hard times...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) people were doing anything they could to find work...
And we see Benjamin, with Mr. Daws, "the lightning man," sitting on a bench with a line of other old men, "killing time," watching the boats going up and down the River...
MR. DAWS Did I ever tell you I was struck by lightning seven times?
MR. DAWS Once, when I was in a field tending to my cows.
And we see just that, Mr. Daws, along with a cow of his, being hit by lightning.
A MAN'S (V.O.) My fourt' hand didn't show up...
A MAN'S (V.O.) Anybody want to make $2 for a day's work around here...
Benjamin turns...
And he sees a man in his late 40s with his three man crew, standing on the deck of a TUGBOAT, and old rusted tug built out of charcoal iron...
The man, its Captain MIKE...
Has a thick Irish accent...
For some reason none of the able-bodied men needing work respond...
CAPT. MIKE What's wrong, nobody wants to get their hands dirty...!
CAPT. MIKE Nobody wants to do an honest days work for an honest day's pay...!
A MAN He never pays...
A MAN He always says he'll have to owe it to you...
MIKE Are all you afraid of workin' for a livin'?
MIKE Somebody got to want a job...
Benjamin suddenly springs up at the opportunity, waving his arms...
BENJAMIN I do...!
CAPT. MIKE You got your sea legs old man?
BENJAMIN I do.
BENJAMIN I think.
CAPT. MIKE That's good enough for me!
CAPT. MIKE Get your ass on board, we'll sure as hell find out!
And as Benjamin gets on the boat, heading out to sea...
And we see Benjamin "learning the ropes..."
Helping to tow the freighters, into and out of the River ports...
Benjamin in this element, like a boy, his hair blowing, thrilled to be on the boat, thrilled by the adventure...
willing to do anything...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I was as happy as I could be...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I would do anything...
CAPT. MIKE I needs a volunteah.
BENJAMIN Yes, Captain!
CAPT. MIKE Scrape off this bird shit.
BENJAMIN Right away, sir...!
And he hops to it...
Happily scraping off the bird shit...
Happy to be doing anything...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And I actually was going to be paid for something I would have done for free.
CAPT. MIKE I'll put you on the books...
CAPT. MIKE pay you next time around...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) His name was Captain Mike Clark...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) He'd been on boats since he was seven...
Mike's a hard drinker, God's last angry man...
He's drinking as they go in for the night...
Benjamin sitting with him in the wheelhouse...
Capt.
Mike jawing away...
CAPT. MIKE ...
CAPT. MIKE What were you born to do, old timer?
BENJAMIN I haven't found out yet.
CAPT. MIKE You haven't found out yet?!
CAPT. MIKE How old are you, Benjamin, seventy somethin' or other?
BENJAMIN Not as old as I look.
CAPT. MIKE Tha's a good one..."
CAPT. MIKE You older than Hades you creaky old bastard!
CAPT. MIKE What the hell you been doing with your life?
BENJAMIN It's a short story...
CAPT. MIKE Can you still get it up?
BENJAMIN I do every morning.
MIKE The old pole?
MIKE The hard'n?
MIKE Can you still get it up?
BENJAMIN I guess.
CAPT. MIKE When was the last time you had a woman, you creaky old bastard...?
BENJAMIN Never.
CAPT. MIKE Never!
BENJAMIN Not that I know of.
CAPT. MIKE You been on this earth for more than seventy years and you never got any?!
CAPT. MIKE That's the saddest thing I ever heard in my life.
CAPT. MIKE Never?
BENJAMIN Never.
CAPT. MIKE Well, then, hell man, you comin' with me!!
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) He took me to meet some friends...
Music playing loud...
We see Benjamin and Capt Mike at the bar...
Mike, hammered...
CAPT. MIKE You din't say?
CAPT. MIKE What did your father do?
BENJAMIN I never met my father.
MIKE You're a lucky bastard!
MIKE All father's want to do is hold you down!..
MIKE Out on my father's boat, working da two-a-days...
MIKE This littl' fat bastard, "tug Irish," what they calls them.
MIKE They say the Irish the only one's stupid `nough to work a tug.
MIKE Them and the Portuguese, as we all know how stupid them Portuguese is.
MIKE I fin'ly get up the nerves and tell him...
MIKE "I don't wanta spend da rest of my life on a goddamn tugboat...!" You know what I'm sayin'?
BENJAMIN You didn't want to spend the rest of your life on a tugboat.
CAPT. MIKE Absolutely, damn right!
CAPT. MIKE So you know what my father says?
CAPT. MIKE He says "Who the hell you think you are?" "What the hell you think you can do?" I tell him.
CAPT. MIKE "Well if you askin' -- I want to be a artist."
CAPT. MIKE He laughs.
CAPT. MIKE He says, "If God wanted you to be an artist he would made you one."
CAPT. MIKE "God wanted you to work a tugboat just like me, and that's what you goin' to do?" "Now, if I ever hear you mention art again, I'll throw you overboard!" Well, I went and I show him...
CAPT. MIKE I made myself an artist...
And he suddenly takes off his shirt, pulls down his pants...
And we see he's covered, from head to toe, with "his artwork," and incredible array of tattoos...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) A tattoos artist...!
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) I puts every one on myself!
And they look it, upside down sideways and backwards...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) You have to skin me alive to take my art away from me now!
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) When I'm dead I'm going to send him my arm!
MIKE (CONT'D) Don't let anyone tell you different!
MIKE (CONT'D) You got to do what you meant to do!
MIKE (CONT'D) And I happen to be a god-damned artist!
BENJAMIN But you're a tugboat captain.
Which stops Captain Mike in mid rant...
And he has no answer for...
His only response is to glare at Benjamin...
A back door opens, a slinky woman coming in...
THE WOMAN Captain Mike, we're ready for you and your friend...
CAPT. MIKE Let's go old timer...
CAPT. MIKE Break your cherry...
CAPT. MIKE This one's on me...
As they go...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) And here's you pay for today...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Don't ever let anybody tell you Captain Mike didn't give a man what he deserved...
BENJAMIN I thought it was $2 for a day's work...
CAPT. MIKE "you can't put a price on education..."
Captain Mike and Benjamin in a small parlor where girls, both black and white, are sitting around...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It was a night to remember...
Captain Mike knows just who he wants and moves off with her...
Benjamin left standing, not knowing what to do...
None of the women seem to anxious to be with the old man...
ONE OF THE WOMEN He gives me the willies...
ONE OF THE WOMEN (CONT'D) He's not for me, no ways...
ONE OF THE WOMEN (CONT'D) A thin Girl, maybe 19, of mixed ethnicity, decides to take a chance...
THE GIRL How are you tonight, Grandpa?
And we see Benjamin and the girl sitting on a bed...
And as she undresses him...
First things first...
tossing him a wash cloth...
THE GIRL Clean yourself up...
THE GIRL He doesn't know what she means..
THE GIRL Taking the wash cloth he goes over to the sink and does what he knows how to do, wash his face...
BENJAMIN Is that any better?
She's pushing him down, hiking up her skirt, all business...
THE GIRL Let's go...
THE GIRL Time's a wastin'...
THE GIRL She climbs on top of him...
THE GIRL And instinct takes over...
THE GIRL But Benjamin being just a boy...
THE GIRL and this being the first time, his excitement gets the immediate best of him...
BENJAMIN Ohhh...!
THE GIRL Come by anytime...
THE GIRL She starts to leave...
THE GIRL But Benjamin, who likes this an awful lot...
BENJAMIN Again?
THE GIRL Again?
THE GIRL She looks and sees, sure enough...
THE GIRL She climbs back on...the results are virtually the same if a bit longer
THE GIRL (CONT'D) My hat's off to you old timer.
THE GIRL (CONT'D) She gets up to go...she's made it to the door...
THE GIRL (CONT'D) when Benjamin says...
BENJAMIN Again?
THE GIRL Again?
THE GIRL She slows, turns to look...
THE GIRL And sure enough...
THE GIRL He's as ready as he's ever going to be...
THE GIRL As she looks at him, a look bordering on amazement...
THE GIRL What are you, Dick Tracy or something?
THE GIRL I've got to rest...
THE GIRL And that's just what she's doing...
THE GIRL trying to catch her breath...
BENJAMIN Again?
And we see Benjamin, at the door, happily smiling...
BENJAMIN Thank you...
THE GIRL No, thank you...
THE GIRL Benjamin, floating on air, hovering, never wants to leave...
THE GIRL (CONT'D) Have a nice night...
BENJAMIN You'll be here tomorrow?
THE GIRL Every night, but Sunday...
And she's finally able to go...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It sure made me understand the value of earning a living...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) the things it can buy you..
Benjamin turns to leave...
we hear footsteps...
And we see a man, putting on a raincoat, coming downstairs from one of those other rooms...
We see it's Benjamin's father...
THOMAS BUTTON...
Seeing Benjamin he slows...
Benjamin, unaware of who he is, turns and goes out...
It's a rainy night.
Benjamin, feeling like a million bucks, walks along the street, going home...
A chauffeured car pulls alongside him, the window rolled down...
And we see Thomas Button in the car...
THOMAS BUTTON It's awful wet out.
THOMAS BUTTON Can I offer you a ride somewhere...?
BENJAMIN That's very kind of you, Sir.
He gets into the car.
They drive in awkward silence.
THOMAS BUTTON My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.
BENJAMIN I'm Benjamin.
THOMAS BUTTON Benjamin...
THOMAS BUTTON Yes, Benjamin...
THOMAS BUTTON It's a pleasure to know you.
They shake hands.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Would you like to stop and have a drink, Benjamin?
A small old bar.
Benjamin and his father sitting in the back...
The waiter comes over, deferring to Benjamin's age...
THE WAITER What will it be sir?
BENJAMIN I'll have whatever he's having.
THOMAS BUTTON A Sazerac for both of us...with whiskey instead of brandy...
The waiter leaves.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) You don't drink do you?
BENJAMIN It's a night for firsts...
THOMAS BUTTON How is that?
BENJAMIN I've never been to a whore house either.
THOMAS BUTTON It's an...
THOMAS BUTTON experience...
BENJAMIN It certainly is.
BENJAMIN I'm not very experienced about a lot of things.
THOMAS BUTTON That isn't a bad thing.
BENJAMIN There's a first time for everything.
THOMAS BUTTON True enough.
THOMAS BUTTON I don't mean to be rude...
THOMAS BUTTON but your hands seem awful bent...
THOMAS BUTTON It must be quite painful?
BENJAMIN I don't really know what I have.
BENJAMIN I have some form of a disease.
BENJAMIN I have a lot of catching up to do.
THOMAS BUTTON What kind of a disease?
BENJAMIN I was born old.
Thomas is quiet.
And for many things...
THOMAS BUTTON I'm sorry.
BENJAMIN No need to be.
BENJAMIN Nothing wrong with old age.
THOMAS BUTTON I'm sorry about your disease.
BENJAMIN My mother says we're all born with something...
THOMAS BUTTON Your mother?
BENJAMIN I'm adopted.
Thomas looks at him...
They get their drinks...
Tap glasses, and drink.
Benjamin coughs at the taste...
But forces it down...
And as they laugh at his discomfort...
Thomas and Benjamin deep in conversation...
and both of them more than a few sheets to the wind...
Benjamin, particularly overblown like any first time drunk...
THOMAS BUTTON ...
THOMAS BUTTON My wife passed away many years ago...
BENJAMIN I'm very sorry.
THOMAS BUTTON She died in childbirth.
And there's a moment when it seems like Thomas might tell him, but despite the alcohol he thinks better of it...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) To children.
BENJAMIN To mothers and fathers...
After some moments:
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) What line of work are you in, Mr.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Button?
THOMAS BUTTON Buttons.
THOMAS BUTTON "Button's Buttons."
THOMAS BUTTON There isn't a button we don't make.
THOMAS BUTTON Our biggest competition is B.F.
THOMAS BUTTON Goodrich and his infernal zippers...
The waiter comes over.
THE WAITER Would you gentlemen like another?
THOMAS BUTTON One more Benjamin?
BENJAMIN If you'll let me pay for it, Mr.
BENJAMIN Button...
He takes out a little of his hard earned pay...
proud of himself...
THOMAS BUTTON What kind of work do you do?
BENJAMIN I'm a tugboat man.
The car's stopped outside the gate...
Benjamin is drunkenly getting out...
THOMAS BUTTON I enjoyed talking to you...
BENJAMIN I enjoyed drinking with you...
He starts to wobble inside...
THOMAS BUTTON Benjamin...
Benjamin slows...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Would you mind, if time to time, I stopped by to say hello...?
BENJAMIN Anytime.
THOMAS BUTTON Goodnight, Benjamin.
BENJAMIN Absolutely...
BENJAMIN Mr. Button...
Benjamin turns inside.
Thomas looks after him for a long moment...
And then he drives away...
Benjamin holding the railing for support starts up the stairs for bed.
QUEENIE'S (V.O.) Where have you been!?
And we see Queenie has been sitting in the front room...
where she can see out the window...
BENJAMIN I listened to some music....
BENJAMIN I --
He doesn't mention the whore...
But generically says...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I met some people.
And right on cue Benjamin, wobbles...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I think mama...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I'm going to...
And to finish the evening, he throws up.
The family's on the lawn...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I loved the weekends when she would come and spend the night with her grandmother.
Daisy, nine now, asleep in bed with Grandma Fuller...
We see Benjamin quietly enter...
He gently nudges Daisy awake...
BENJAMIN Do you want to see something?
BENJAMIN We have to keep it secret.
Daisy, always willing, always brave, gets up...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Get dressed.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I'll meet you behind the kitchen...
And he leaves the room as quickly as he came...
Benjamin, in an old peacoat, holding another -- waits...
Daisy comes out...
as he stops the door from slamming...
BENJAMIN Ssssh...
BENJAMIN Can you swim?
DAISY I can do anything you can do...
BENJAMIN Put this on...
He gives her a heavy coat...she puts it on...
It's two sizes too big for her...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) We have to go fast...
And she follows him between the houses...
the two of them going quickly down the street...
Fog.
The first light of dawn.
A full compliment of boats tied up for the night...
They scamper along the dock...
to the "Chelsea" ...Benjamin helps her climb aboard...
He goes downstairs to find -- Captain Mike sprawled across his bunk -- in all his naked tattooed glory, an empty bottle on the floor...
DAISY What's wrong with him?
BENJAMIN I think he has mejembe.
BENJAMIN Captain Mike...
BENJAMIN could you take us out?
Captain Mike opens one eye...
sees them standing there...
CAPT. MIKE You know what day it is?
BENJAMIN Sunday.
CAPT. MIKE Do you know what dat mean?
He doesn't.
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) It means I was very drunk last night.
BENJAMIN You're drunk every night.
Captain Mike just squints.
CAPT. MIKE Is that a girl?
BENJAMIN A close friend...
BENJAMIN I wanted to show her the River.
CAPT. MIKE I'm not supposed to be joy-ridin' with civilians...
CAPT. MIKE I could lose my license.
That notion stops him for about a nanosecond.
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) What you standin' there for!
The tugboat making its way through the fog...
Benjamin standing with Daisy on the prow...
the wind in their faces...
And suddenly out of the fog a HORN BLARES...
As loud as anything they have ever heard...
and moving out of the mist, horn still echoing, a huge ocean liner appears...
With three other tugboats pushing it to sea...
CAPT. MIKE She put in for repair...
CAPT. MIKE a wounded duck...
CAPT. MIKE She's flyin' now...
Captain Mike joins the tugs at the liner's side...
the tugs sounding horns of their own...
a symphony of a kind...
What interests Benjamin...
BENJAMIN What does it take to build something like that?
Passengers line the railing...
continuing their adventure...
And what interests Daisy...
DAISY Imagine all the places they're going to see...
Daisy, thrilled, waves to them -- the passengers along the rail, waving back...
Benjamin stands by Daisy, their hair blowing in the salty air....
DAISY (CONT'D) I wish we could go with them...
As they watch the liner, like a foggy dream, sailing away...
The rain and wind knocking at the window...
DAISY I wish we could have...
CAROLINE Did you say something, Mother?
And there's a hint of anxiety in Caroline now...
anxiety coupled with exhaustion...
Daisy doesn't say anything.
Caroline worriedly looks out the window.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) It seems to be getting worse.
Daisy doesn't respond.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Are you hearing me, mother?
DAISY Look at that...
DAISY time just seeped out of me...
CAROLINE What?
DAISY Somebody will come and mop it up and that will be the end...
Caroline can only listen...
She takes a deep breath, gathering her strength...And when her mother's settled again...
CAROLINE Do you want me to go on reading?
She murmurs, "Hmmm?" as if she didn't know Caroline had stopped.
Caroline looks back down at the book.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "Things were changing quickly."
We see Benjamin's REFLECTION in a mirror...
WE PULL BACK TO SEE we're in his friend's room...
Benjamin sitting in a straight back chair...
getting a haircut...
the dog at their feet...
the VICTROLA, as usual, is working overtime...
THE WOMAN I don't know how it's possible, you seem to have more hair...
BENJAMIN What if I was to tell you I wasn't getting older -- I was getting younger than everybody else...
And she then says, taking the wind out of his sails...
THE WOMAN Well, I'd feel very sorry for you...
THE WOMAN to have to see everybody you love, die before you.
He's quiet, he hadn't thought of that...
THE WOMAN (CONT'D) That would be an awful responsibility...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I had never thought about life or death that way before...
He's still...
And seeing he's upset, she says the most beautiful of things...
THE WOMAN Benjamin...
THE WOMAN We're meant to lose the people we love.
THE WOMAN How else would we know how important they are to us.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And one fall day...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) a familiar visitor came knocking on our door...
We see Benjamin knocking on the Woman's door...
BENJAMIN Would you like to go for a walk?
There's no response.
He opens it, going inside...
The Woman is sitting in a chair by the window, the dog at her feet, the familiar Victrola playing dance music...
He comes around the chair.
And he sees she's still...
perfectly still...
her soul moved on...
We see an old New Orleans paupers' cemetery...
Benjamin and the mourners, and because he can't remember her name, around an unmarked grave...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She had taught me how to play the piano.
As Benjamin watches the woman go to her final rest.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) And she taught me what it meant to miss somebody.
We see Benjamin taking some things out of a dresser drawer, packing a suitcase...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I had gone to a whore house, I'd had my first drink, I had said goodbye to one friend and buried another...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) In 1937, when I was coming to end of the 17th year of my life, I packed by bag.
We see him putting some final things into the suitcase, closing it...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...and said goodbye...
We see Benjamin moving through the parlor, one by one, saying his good-byes to the old people...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I knew, life being what it was, I would probably never see them again...
The familiar faces...
And as we watch him affectionately touch or talk to each of them...
we can just see out a screen window DAISY, almost thirteen now, leaning against the side of the house...
Out of sight...
as if she didn't say goodbye, he wouldn't leave...
We see TIZZY on the porch holding Benjamin's suitcase for him...
The woman's old dog lying beside him...
TIZZY Good luck, son.
And we see Queenie has come out onto the porch with her little girl...
and he holds Queenie...
tears running down her face...
BENJAMIN Goodbye, Mother...
He bends to pet the old dog goodbye...
He takes up his suitcase and starts off the porch...
going down the walkway...
he hesitates, and opens the gate...
moving out onto the street...
When suddenly Daisy is calling him...
DAISY Benjamin...
DAISY Benjamin...
She comes running.
He stops to let her catch up to him...
DAISY (CONT'D) Where are you going?
BENJAMIN To sea.
BENJAMIN I'll send you a postcard.
DAISY From everywhere.
DAISY Write me a postcard from everywhere...
And with so much she wants to say, she can't say anything.
So she runs away...
He watches her go, watchers her thin legs running back down the street...
and he turns and moves off along the street...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And I went off to sea...
We see him in the distance, the "old man", a 17 year old, suitcase in hand, going to find out who he is and what he is to become...
Daisy's quiet.
Caroline can't avoid the howling of the wind.
CAROLINE I think I should find out what's going on...
DAISY There's a box of them...
DAISY in a velvet bag...
Caroline, not sure what she wants, opens a red velvet bag...
she finds a wooden cigar box...
CAROLINE Is this what you're looking for?
DAISY Looking for?
CAROLINE You said you wanted this?
DAISY Of course.
She gives her the box...
Daisy, opens it...
It's filled with postcards...
Daisy, going through them...
DAISY (CONT'D) Can you imagine...
DAISY (CONT'D) He sent me postcards from everywhere he went...
DAISY (CONT'D) every place he worked...
DAISY (CONT'D) Newfoundland...
DAISY (CONT'D) Baffin Bay...
DAISY (CONT'D) Liverpool...
DAISY (CONT'D) Glasgow...Narvik...
She takes one out, reading it...
Taking up some others...
looking...
reading where they came from...
reading off like an adventure...
Daisy, the postcards, fond memories spread out on the bed around her...
DAISY (CONT'D) Please keep reading, sugar...
Caroline takes another look at the window, then takes up the book...
CAROLINE "I had gone.."
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) With Captain Mike's crew on the "Chelsea"..."
The Tugboat, in the distance, steaming through the ocean...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Captain Mike had contracted for three years with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) The old ship had been refitted with a diesel engine, and a new sea winch...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We went around Florida and up the Atlantic seaboard...
The refitted "Chelsea" on the Atlantic Ocean...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We were a crew of seven now...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Captain Mike and me...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) the Cookie...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Prentiss Mayes from Wilmington, Delaware...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And we see an old sea hand in his domain, his GALLEY, smoking and coughing as he cooks...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...The Brody twins...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Rick and Vic...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Two burly hard working IDENTICAL TWIN BROTHERS...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S(V.O.) (CONT'D) Who got along fine at sea...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S(V.O.) (CONT'D) but for some reason, once they were on dry land...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S(V.O.) (CONT'D) couldn't stand the sight of each other...
The brothers getting off the tug...
and no sooner have they hit dry land they immediately get into a fist fight...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) There was John Grimm, who fit his name...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) from Belvedere, South Dakota...
We see a dour looking man...
who always expects the worst...
JOHN GRIMM You know one in every eight boats never returns, all hands lost at sea.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) ...and Pleasant Curtis who never said a word to anyone...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) except to himself...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) The asocial Pleasant...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) talking to himself as he works...
Benjamin standing on the bow of the old tug as it sloughs through a fog on the high seas...
ready to see the world.
Daisy lying in bed...
DAISY I wrote him constantly...
DAISY told him everything I was doing...
The tug on its way in for the night...
Benjamin, sitting on a cleat, reading her letter...
DAISY'S (V.O.) ...I told him they had invited me to New York to audition for the School of American Ballet...
Tilting from the grey sky, onto an old landmark building.
A large open DANCE LOFT.
And we see Daisy, dancing for a selection committee seated on metal chairs...
Daisy moving with technical proficiency -- but it's bloodless, without any real distinction...
She gets nods - - but no kudos...
DAISY'S (V.O.) One of the "corps"...
DAISY'S (V.O.) another dancing gypsy...
DAISY'S (V.O.) We see Daisy training...
DAISY'S (V.O.) just another lithe body.
Daisy in bed...
Picking up another postcard, she stops, reading, slowing at a painful memory...
DAISY Oh.
DAISY Then he wrote me...
DAISY "I've met somebody...
DAISY and I've fallen in love..."
And we see Daisy, sitting on the dance floor reading the very same POSTCARD, brokenhearted...
A MAN Places everybody...
A MAN Once again...
A MAN The troupe moves into their places...Daisy still just part of the crowd...
A MAN The music starts...
A MAN Now as Daisy dances...
A MAN it is filled with pathos and lost love...and everyone takes notice.
Daisy reading the very postcard some sixty odd years later...
as if reading it for the first time...
DAISY "...I've met somebody...and I've fallen in love..."
DAISY My, that was over...
DAISY ...sixty years ago.
DAISY She's quiet, looking out the window...
CAROLINE Did you love him, mother?
DAISY What can a girl know about love?
As she watches the rain on the window, Caroline takes it as her cue to keep reading...
CAROLINE "...We were working in Murmansk, Russia..."
Daisy stares at the window, the constant beating rain, the water running down the window...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Murmansk is on the Barrent Sea, the only ice-free ocean port in the Soviet Union...
We see "Chelsea" working with other tugs as snow falls in the crowded Russian Harbor.
They tow a large freighter into port.
CAPT. MIKE Benjamin...
CAPT. MIKE Benjamin, who is coiling rope on the bow, stands and looks at the Captain.
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Tell me how's it happen you showed up you were no bigger than a bollard.
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Now either I drink a helluva lot more than I think I do, or you sprouted...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) What's your secret?
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) And Benjamin, tired of explanations, and what comes first to mind...
BENJAMIN Well Captain, you do drink a lot...
BENJAMIN And that makes perfect sense to Mike...
CAPT. MIKE Goddamn right I do!
CAPT. MIKE And Benjamin stands on the bow...
CAPT. MIKE ready to see the world...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We stayed at a small hotel with the grand name, "The Winter Palace."
Snow covers the street outside of a turn-of-the Century hotel...
a front window looks into its lobby...
"The Winter Palace Hotel."
There's a packed BAR off the lobby...
We see Benjamin sitting with Captain Mike, their crew, and a mixture of other seamen, Russians and other ethnics, all speaking different languages, sitting and standing around tables cluttered with bottles and glasses...
Captain Mike, drunk, his shirt off, is telling a Russian sailor, another interpreting for him -- about a tattoo he has over his heart...
an upside down hummingbird...
CAPT. MIKE I saws this tattoo puts on a man's back in Singapore by Sakumoro, the greatest tattoo artist ever lived.
CAPT. MIKE I puts it on myself from mem'ry.
CAPT. MIKE And now we know why it's upside down...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) This idn't just anoter bird!
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Its heart rate's twelve hunerd beats a minute...!
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Its wings beats eighty times a second...!
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) If you was to stop their wings from beatin, they would be dyin' in less than ten seconds...This is no ordinary bird, this is a frikkin' miracle!
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) They slowed down the wings
MIKE (CONT'D) wit' movin' pictures, you know what it showed, they wing tips are doin' dis...
MIKE (CONT'D) And he draws on a napkin a FIGURE EIGHT...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Does you know what the figure- eight is the mathematical symbol of...?!
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Pointing at the symbol...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Infinity!
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) And for some drunken reason, no matter what language they might speak, they all laugh...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Everybody, no matter what differences they had, the languages, the color of their skin, had one thing in common...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) they were drunk every single night...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Then there's a shout -- and as if to underscore things, the Brody twins are kicking the shit out of each other again...
We see Benjamin waiting for the small caged elevator to take him to his room.
He gets in, the elevator operator about to shut the grill door...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) Would you wait, please...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) And we see a WOMAN in her late 40s...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) getting on the elevator...
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) Benjamin looks over at her...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She was not beautiful.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She was plain as paper...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) But she was as pretty as any picture to me...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "Plain as paper," ELIZABETH ABBOTT...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Directly behind her walks a tall, tired man, in his 50s...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) By the look of his ruddy face, and her silent mien...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) they're both drunk...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Benjamin finds himself looking at her...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT What are you looking at?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT She has a distinctly English accent.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Benjamin doesn't say a word.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) If you must know, we have a long standing agreement never to go to bed sober.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Isn't that right darling?
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Her husband was Walter Abbott...He was Chief Minister of the British Trade Mission in Murmansk...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) and he was a spy...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) They ride up.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Elizabeth has her shoes off...She sees him noting her stocking feet...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) The elevator finally rattles to a stop, and George and Elizabeth get off...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Starting down the hall...she abruptly turns to say to Benjamin...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) so that it's completely understood...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I broke the heel off of one of my shoes...I don't usually walk around in my bare feet...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT And as he watches her saunter along the hallway...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT the way drunks do...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT endeavoring to keep her dignity...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) They were long days there...
Benjamin on the tug, but it's less fun now, not much adventure, just hard work...
Fighting the snow and the wind, they tow a large freighter into port...
Benjamin, in his small room, cold air blasting through the windows, looking out the window into the snowy night...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And longer nights...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) He lays on his bed looking out at the dark sky...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) the snow falling...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) One particular night...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) when I was having trouble sleeping...
Benjamin trudges down the stairs, stepping tentatively into the empty lobby...
He slows, seeing ELIZABETH ABBOTT in her bathrobe, sitting, alone and lonely...
and it's not the first time for her...
BENJAMIN I'm sorry...
BENJAMIN I can't sleep...
BENJAMIN She's quiet...
BENJAMIN She finally looks up...
BENJAMIN but doesn't say anything...
BENJAMIN There's an awkward moment...exacerbated by the stillness of the hotel in the middle of the night...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I was going to make some tea...would you like some?
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) She shakes her head no...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) He crosses through the empty bar, into an old KITCHEN...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) He looks for tea...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Puts water in a kettle...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) As he watches the kettle boil...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Elizabeth, her arms folded across her chest as if she were chilled, stands by the door...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Benjamin, without asking, takes a cup for her...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Milk...?
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Honey...?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Some honey, thank you.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT He finds a large honey jar...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT and seeing some dead flies in with the sweet syrup he asks...
BENJAMIN Do you like flies with your tea?
BENJAMIN She smiles...for the first time...
BENJAMIN A thin smile...
BENJAMIN He starts to stir the tea...
BENJAMIN Elizabeth stopping him...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT You must let it steep for a minute...
BENJAMIN Steep?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Sit.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT There's a proper way to make tea.
BENJAMIN Where I'm from, they just want it to be hot.
BENJAMIN She doesn't smile.
BENJAMIN He gives her a cup of tea...
BENJAMIN She cradles the cup...
BENJAMIN They're quiet, drinking their tea...two strangers...
BENJAMIN After some moments...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT You're a seaman?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I don't mean to be rude...but aren't you rather old to be working on a boat?
BENJAMIN There's no age limit...
BENJAMIN as long as you can do the work...
BENJAMIN She nods...
BENJAMIN They're quiet again.
BENJAMIN She sits at an old wood counter.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT You have trouble sleeping?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT It's an invitation to sit with her...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT He pulls a stool over sitting across from her...
BENJAMIN I didn't know I did...
BENJAMIN I usually sleep like a baby.
BENJAMIN Something kept me up.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I never sleep...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Well, rarely anyway...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT He doesn't say anything.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) My father, when he was in his eighties, was so sure he was going to die in his sleep...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) He would only take naps during the afternoon...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) so that death couldn't catch him...
BENJAMIN Did he?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Did he what?
BENJAMIN Die in his sleep?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT He died sitting in his favorite chair listening to his favorite program on the radio.
BENJAMIN He must have known something.
BENJAMIN She smiles at the idea...
BENJAMIN Another one...
BENJAMIN that goes as quickly as it's come...
BENJAMIN And it's quiet again...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT My husband's the British Trade Minister.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT We've been here fourteen months...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT We were supposed to be going to Peking...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT but it just never did work out.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT It never does seem to work out.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Have you been to the Far East?
BENJAMIN I haven't really been anywhere.
BENJAMIN I mean outside different harbors.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Where are you from?
BENJAMIN New Orleans, Louisiana.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I didn't know there was another one.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Which escapes him.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) I've never been to America.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Everywhere else.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) But not America.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Am I missing anything?
BENJAMIN The Mississippi River.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And she told me all the places she had been, and what she had seen...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I can tell you what bars look like in places all over the world...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And we talked until just before the dawn...
The first hint of daylight...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Thank you for the tea...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT She leaves as quietly as she entered...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Benjamin remains standing for a moment...then shuts the light off behind him.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) ...And we went back to our rooms...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) to our separate lives...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And as he goes back up the quiet stairs...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) And every night...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) we would meet in the middle Of the night...
Benjamin padding downstairs...
slowing...
happy to see Elizabeth, in her bathrobe, sitting in the empty lobby, waiting for him...
Elizabeth and Benjamin quietly talking...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) A hotel in the middle of the night can be a magical place...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And we see the empty front desk and tiny silver bell...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) The vacant lobby, with its musty old rugs...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) The open elevator, waiting...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) The dining room, with its crisp white tablecloths.
(CONT'D) A mouse stopping and running and stopping...
(CONT'D) A mouse crossing the lobby floor doing just that...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) A radiator hissing.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) A sink dripping.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) A floor creaking.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) A curtain blowing.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) We see and hear it all...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) All the little sounds, a symphony, that make up life in a hotel in the middle of the night...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Benjamin and Elizabeth sitting quietly drinking their tea.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) There is something peaceful, even comforting, knowing that people you love are asleep in their beds, where nothing can harm them...
Queenie and Tizzy asleep together in her bed...
Their child on the floor...
The old people in their beds in the old house.
Ngunda Oti asleep in a room somewhere.
The unnamed woman's grave.
A different kind of sleep.
And of course Daisy, in a New York apartment loft with other dancers...
sleeping peacefully.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Elizabeth and I would talk through the night until just before dawn...
Daylight starts to creep in...
she gets up, about to go...
she slows...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I may have given you the wrong impression.
BENJAMIN The wrong impression?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT You must think I don't love my husband.
BENJAMIN Why do you say that?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Married women don't usually sit with strange men in a hotel in the middle of the night.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I certainly don't.
BENJAMIN I don't know what married women do or don't do.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Let's get one thing straight.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I love him very much.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I happen to think he is one of the smartest and most considerate men I ever met.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT It is not his fault I decided to spend my life in his shadow.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT And with that she gets up and leaves...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Benjamin, left with that thought...
Benjamin and Elizabeth in the empty dining room at a table with a white tablecloth...
with some wine and cheese...
She's laughing now, measurably loosened up...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT He started to take his pants off...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I'm afraid he misread me completely...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT He laughs.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT She looks through her wine glass at him...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Do you notice how people look better through a wine glass...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) He holds his up....
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) looking at her....She moves her glass just looking at him...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) You're a good looking man with or without a wine glass...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) She picks at the tablecloth with her finger next to his...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) She puts her finger over his making a cross...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) We are all just crossing in the night.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Sometimes we intersect.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) She leaves her finger there for a moment...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) lingering...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) She abruptly moves it away...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) I should go to bed...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) he'll be up soon.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) She hesitates...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) And she kisses him, and then hurries out of the dining room...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) As Benjamin sits in the empty dining room...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) the kiss left on his lips...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It was the first time a woman had ever kissed me.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It's something you never forget.
The wind and rain knocking at the window.
Daisy silently lying in bed.
CAROLINE Are you upset, Mother?
CAROLINE She doesn't say anything.
CAROLINE Caroline, seeing her feet have come out of the covers, caring, fixes her blanket.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Would you like some socks?
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Daisy's quiet.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Do you want me to stop reading?
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Daisy's answer for her is...
DAISY It must have been very cold.
DAISY I'm glad he had somebody to keep him warm.
DAISY Which Caroline takes as her cue to read on...
CAROLINE "I couldn't wait to see her again."
Benjamin comes hurrying down the stairs.
Elizabeth is waiting, as she normally is, but this time she is dressed...
Lipstick and hair done...
wearing a fur.
BENJAMIN I'm not dressed --
ELIZABETH ABBOTT You're delicious just as you are...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT She laughs, taking his arm, walking to the dining room as if going to dinner...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT They sit at a table...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT which she has set for them...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Caviar and Vodka...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Don't bother with the cheese or the wine here, they're quite common...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) but the caviar and the vodka are plentiful and sublime...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) She feeds him a spoonful of the caviar...Unaccustomed to it, he swallows it too quickly...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Take your time...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) If you eat it all at once there will be nothing left to enjoy...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) savor it...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) She gives him another spoonful...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) and takes one herself...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) He takes his time...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) They both do...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) savoring it...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Now, a swallow of vodka...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Which they do...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) She laughs...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Looking at him...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) You haven't been with many women have you?
BENJAMIN No.
BENJAMIN Not many.
BENJAMIN At least none on a Sunday.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I feel like I'm with a virgin.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT She's not far off...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT And it's a lovely thought...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT and it makes her think of her youth.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) When I was nineteen, I tried to become the first woman to swim the English Channel...
And we see just that....Young Elizabeth, in goggles, her body covered with grease, swimming with two escort boats across the English Channel.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) The current was so strong...that for every stroke I took...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) I was pushed two strokes back...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) And we see just that, Elizabeth fighting the current...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) I swam for 32 hours...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) I was only two miles from the French shore...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) Elizabeth in sight of the lights of Calais...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) When it started to rain...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) And it starts to rain on her...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) Harder and harder...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) the shore is suddenly gone from sight...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) When I couldn't go any further, and I just stopped...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) And we see her being taken onto a boat, a blanket wrapped around her...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) They asked me whether I would try again...?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Why wouldn't I?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT She smiles, a young girl, full of life...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I never did.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT As a matter of fact, I have never done much of anything with my life after that...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT And it's quiet.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT She touches his rough hand.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Your hands are very rough...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) you have grease under your nails...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) She runs her fingernail along his face...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) I can feel the wind on your face...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) They look at each other.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) And this time, Benjamin kisses her.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) It lingers...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) She stops herself...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) I'm afraid it's the witching hour...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) She quickly gets up...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) And she's gone.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) As Benjamin sits in the empty dining room.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It took me a long time to go to sleep.
We see Elizabeth nicely dressed, a bottle of champagne in her hand, sitting anxiously waiting.
The elevator doors open.
Benjamin in a suit and tie, as handsome as we've seen him steps out.
She stands, takes his arm.
BENJAMIN Do I look okay?
BENJAMIN I borrowed it from one of the men.
BENJAMIN It's his church suit.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT You take my breath away.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT She walks with him, champagne bottle in hand, through the empty lobby...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) The thing about clothing is, it should make you feel comfortable, then you will be comfortable...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Come, let's take a walk...
Their arms in each other's, their breath showing in the night, they walk through the sleeping Russian town, their shadows in the moonlight.
They stop to share a drink from the champagne bottle.
They laugh.
BENJAMIN I feel so much younger when I'm with you...
BENJAMIN And it seems he's about to go on...
BENJAMIN But Elizabeth, flattered, takes it metaphorically...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT That's such a nice thing to say.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT You make me feel years younger, too.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I wish I was.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I would change so many things.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I would undo all of my mistakes.
BENJAMIN What mistakes?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I kept waiting, thinking I would do something to change my circumstance...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Do something...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT But I never did...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT It's an awful waste, you can never get it back...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT wasted time...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT They're quiet.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT She looks at him.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) If we're going to have an affair, you're never to look at me during the day, we must always part by sunrise, and we can never say "I love you..."
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) He's quiet...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) And when it is over I will send you a card that will simply say goodbye...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Those are the rules...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) They stand in the cold.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) His answer is...
BENJAMIN Are you as cold as I am?
ELIZABETH ABBOTT My god, colder.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT They stop to finish what's left of the champagne, Elizabeth hurling the bottle.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT The bottle falling silently into some fresh snow.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) You can't even break a bottle here.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) They look at each other and they kiss.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) And without anything else needing to be said, they start back...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Get a key.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Benjamin goes behind the registration desk, taking an empty room key off a hook...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT They cross to the elevator...
They stand in the elevator as it ascends.
Anticipating what's to come...
They move along a dark hallway.
He quietly unlocks an empty room door...
And as he follows her into the room...
the door closing.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She was the first woman who ever loved me.
Benjamin, in his peacoat, and stocking cap, snow on him, hurries into the hotel from work...
He runs to the elevator, the doors just closing.
BENJAMIN Hold it...
BENJAMIN It opens.
BENJAMIN He goes inside.
BENJAMIN And Elizabeth's husband is standing in the elevator.
They silently ride up, not a word exchanged.
The elevator stops.
Elizabeth's husband gets out.
As he quietly walks down the hall...
BENJAMIN'S (V.O.) We saw each other every night...
BENJAMIN'S (V.O.) we always used the same room...
We see the key going into the door...
Benjamin and Elizabeth going inside closing the door behind them...
leaving us with the quiet hallway.
BENJAMIN'S (V.O.) But each time seemed new and different...
BENJAMIN'S (V.O.) And we see them as dawn creeps along the hallway, Benjamin and Elizabeth, leaving the room, not wanting to part, passionately kissing, and as they start to go their separate ways...
BENJAMIN Elizabeth...
BENJAMIN She turns.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) You should swim the English channel again.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) And as she laughs to herself and hurries off...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Until one night...
We see Benjamin coming down the stairs, into the lobby to meet Elizabeth.
And he slows...Elizabeth isn't there.
He looks into the bar...the kitchen....the dining room...
He goes back to the lobby, sitting on a lone sofa, waiting for her...
A mouse runs across the marble floor, stops, looks at him and runs off...
And he sits and waits.
Snow shrouds the windows.
We see Benjamin has fallen asleep on the sofa...
There's the distinctive BELLOW of Captain Mike's VOICE.
Benjamin wakes...
He follows the bellowing to find Captain Mike with the tugboat CREW in the bar...
CAPT. MIKE Roosevelt says we all got to do our part!
CAPT. MIKE After them Japs attacked Pearl Harbor everyone's got to!
CAPT. MIKE The Chelsea's been commissioned to serve in the United States Navy, to repair, tow, salvage and rescue...
CAPT. MIKE Anybody don't want to go to war, now's the time to say so...
CAPT. MIKE Once you set foot on that boat again, you're in the Navy friend!
BENJAMIN I'll go captain!
CAPT. MIKE Easy old timer.
CAPT. MIKE I'll hold it against no man.
CAPT. MIKE But speak up now or forever hold your water.
CAPT. MIKE And the Cook, Prentis Mayes...
THE COOK I was planning on talking to you Cap'n Mike...
THE COOK My wife's doing poorly.
THE COOK I'd like to see her one more time...
CAPT. MIKE You're free to get home any way you can Mr. Mayes.
And the cook walks off.
JOHN GRIMM Who do you intend to have cook then?
JOHN GRIMM One of the leading causes of death at sea is food poisoning, right after inadequate safety equipment.
BENJAMIN I grew up cooking, sir.
BENJAMIN I'll take the job, if I'm not too old to serve.
CAPT. MIKE You a real Johnny on the Spot, Benjamin.
CAPT. MIKE I'll take any able bodied mens who wants kick shit out of the Japs and the Huns.
CAPT. MIKE And with no one dissenting...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Then that's it!
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) We's goin' to war, gentlemen!
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) And filled with fervor, they give a cheer.
Benjamin unlocking the door to his room.
An ENVELOPE has been left under the door, he opens it.
BENJAMIN'S (V.O.) She had left a note.
BENJAMIN'S (V.O.) She wrote, "it was nice to have met you."
BENJAMIN'S (V.O.) That was it.
BENJAMIN'S (V.O.) And as he stands holding the letter in his room at the
small Russian hotel:
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And so, I went to war.
The men on the tug on a dark gray sea....
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It wasn't the war we expected.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We would tow crippled ships...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) scraps of metal...
(CONT'D) across the high seas...
(CONT'D) If there was a war, we didn't see it...
(CONT'D) And what seemed exciting, the idea of war...
(CONT'D) is tedious...
(CONT'D) The "Chelsea" towing a strange hulking shape on the dark, empty sea...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) There was a man assigned with us...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) The Chief Gunner loved the Navy, and most of all, he loved America.
THE MAN'S (V.O.) There is no other country in the world...!
THE MAN'S (V.O.) When YOU spell America, A.M.E.R.I.C.A.
THE MAN'S (V.O.) You're spelling freedom...!
THE MAN'S (V.O.) We see the young Gunnery Mate, no more than nineteen...
THE MAN'S (V.O.) sitting at his post on a high caliber machine gun...
THE MAN'S (V.O.) ready to kick some enemy ass...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) His name was Dennis Smith and he was a full blooded Cherokee...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) His family had been in America for over five hundred years.
DENNIS SMITH You have these pacifists.
DENNIS SMITH They say they won't fight on conscience.
DENNIS SMITH Where would we be if everybody decided to act according to their conscience?
CAPT. MIKE Keeps it down, would you chief!
CAPT. MIKE He goes back inside...
CAPT. MIKE And as they settle into their tasks..
DENNIS SMITH Where else can you shoot white people and get away with it...
DENNIS SMITH Benjamin's the only one around to hear him...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I worked in the kitchen...
Benjamin busy preparing a meal in the galley kitchen.
The Perpetually silent Pleasant Curtis, on kitchen duty, helping him with the preparation...
while they work...
BENJAMIN You're from the Kentucky mountains aren't you?
BENJAMIN It must be pretty there..
BENJAMIN Pleasant Curtis doesn't say a word.
BENJAMIN Benjamin shrugging, puts the pie in an oven.
The men; including Dennis Smith, Pleasant Curtis, John Grimm, the "fighting" Brody twins, Benjamin serving them, silently eating dinner, rolling with endless rolling Ocean.
Pleasant, not interested, just gets up and leaves.
JOHN GRIMM There's something not normal about him.
JOHN GRIMM As they silently eat, mostly bored...
DENNIS SMITH Whoever said "War is hell," doesn't know shit from shinola.
We see "Chelsea," a steel tow line splayed out from its winch, towing a large crippled freighter across the ocean...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We were towing a British freighter, that had gone dead in the water, 800 miles to Halifax for repair...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We see Benjamin and the crew watching the ship on the tow line run out some thousand feet behind them...
We see Benjamin awake in his bunk, Dennis Smith asleep in the bunk above him.
Pleasant Curtis seemingly asleep in his bunk below him...
Benjamin looking out at the black sea...
and out of the silence Pleasant Curtis for the first time speaks...
PLEASANT CURTIS I've been watching you.
PLEASANT CURTIS You seem trustworthy.
PLEASANT CURTIS If something happens to me...
PLEASANT CURTIS could you see this gets to my wife...?
PLEASANT CURTIS He hands Benjamin a folded up handkerchief...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) He had given me all of his pay...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) he hadn't spent a dime of it...
PLEASANT CURTIS If anything happens I want my family to know I was thinking about them, and if I could have, I'd have come back home.
PLEASANT CURTIS And that said he turns back over...
PLEASANT CURTIS And as Benjamin looks
at the dark foreboding sea...
suddenly:
CAPT. MIKE (OVER) All hands on deck!!!
CAPT. MIKE (OVER) They bolt from their bunks...
CAPT. MIKE (OVER) Going outside...
Captain Mike stands by the wheelhouse...
silently looking at the ocean...
They see bodies of men, dead men, floating by them...
One and two at first...
then three and four...
and then more and more until they are moving through a carpet of bodies...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) The war found us.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) As they move through the water...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) their propeller literally chopping up bodies, to where they have to veritably shut their engines down...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) A transport carrying 900 men had been hit by a torpedo.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) We were first to arrive at the scene...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) And as the tug arrives at the scene we see a TRANSPORT VESSEL, with a gaping hole in its midships sinking quickly...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) Fuel oil burning on the water...
It's then we see the true horror of the men in the water...
in the burning black oil...
The transport boat silently slips into the water, disappearing under the sea...
As the tug moves through the thick black smoke...
Benjamin and the other crewmen watching along the rails...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) There wasn't a sound...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Except for the lapping of water, and the tugboat's engines, there isn't...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) just the silence of death...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Something else appears, doming onto the surface like a spectre...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) the U-BOAT that had reeked this havoc...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) looking to see the results...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Captain Mike sees the sub...
CAPT. MIKE We can't run from the fucker and we can't hide...!
CAPT. MIKE There's only one thing we can do...!
CAPT. MIKE Battle Stations...!!!
CAPT. MIKE They run to their battle stations...
Captain Mike at the wheel in the pilot house, turning the tug, furiously bearing down on the surfaced submarine...
A German submariner, on the conning tower, seeing the Tugboat, turns the .50 caliber machine gun on the tugboat...
Benjamin is grazed by a bullet, his forehead cut open, bleeding...
Despite the strafing the tug is relentless...
The submarine, seeing it is about to be rammed tries to dive...
but it's too late...
the tugboat ramming the submarine...
severing the U-Boat in half.
The concussion of the collision has triggered a torpedo in the sinking submarine's torpedo shaft, the torpedo exploding, bursting the submarine, and in the process, blasting away under the stern of the tugboat...
the men on the stern blown to pieces...
Benjamin's literally thrown against the wheel house...
He manages to get to his feet, the tug listing, beginning to sink...
There's a man's voice...
And he sees, Captain Mike riddled with bullets, his body covered with blood...
Benjamin bends to him...
Captain Mike trembling as he lays dying...
CAPT. MIKE Look at what they did!
CAPT. MIKE They shot holes in me!
CAPT. MIKE They shots the hell out my paintin'!
CAPT. MIKE His body, his tattoos, like a ripped canvas, is riddled...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) You've seen a lot of things.
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Tell me it's going to be alright.
BENJAMIN You're going to heaven Captain Mike.
BENJAMIN You're going to heaven.
BENJAMIN Benjamin sits beside him, his friend Captain Mike, dying.
BENJAMIN And a light comes in Captain Mike's eyes...
BENJAMIN an understanding.
CAPT. MIKE You can be mad as a mad dawg at the way things wents...
CAPT. MIKE You can swear, curse the fates, regret every'ting you ever dids...
CAPT. MIKE but when it comes to the end...
CAPT. MIKE You have to lets go...
CAPT. MIKE He looks in Benjamin's old eyes....
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Give me a hand, old man...
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) And as he holds Benjamin's hand ready to meet his maker...
There are two destroyers and a hospital ship in the battle zone flow...
Planes circling...
The water still speckled with debris, and bodies...
We see Benjamin at the railing of a Liberty Ship..
He watches the "Chelsea" sink, disappearing under the sea...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) 736 men died that day...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis Smith, John Grimm who was right, he was going to die there...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) He instinctively turns, and sees Rick Brody looking out a porthole, lost without his twin brother...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) And to Mike Clark...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Captain of the tugboat "Chelsea."
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) A storage cabinet is opened, a sailor taking out a wreath, from a supply of just such wreaths...
BENJAMIN You mind...
BENJAMIN The Sailor shrugs, giving him the wreath...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I said goodbye to all the other men...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) who had dreams of their own...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) All the men who wanted to be plumbers or singers or insurance salesmen or doctors...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) or lawyers or Indian chiefs.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And suddenly, angrily, he throws the wreath into the water...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Out here, death didn't seem normal.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Benjamin standing at the rail of the ship...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) no longer a boy...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) And a SAILOR standing beside him....
THE SAILOR This don't get fixed...
THE SAILOR Benjamin's quiet.
THE SAILOR When suddenly a HUMMINGBIRD comes flying across the water...
THE SAILOR It circles the wreath, the way Hummingbirds do...
THE SAILOR and then flies off...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) ...I'd never seen a hummingbird that far out to sea before...
And as Benjamin stands at the railing, looking at the sea...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) In the spring of 1945....
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) when I was 26 years old...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) I went home...
We see Benjamin, suitcase in hand, going up the walk to the old house.
We're struck by the difference...
the old man who had left to see the world has returned a strikingly handsome man in his fifties.
The old blind dog, smelling ham, ambles off the porch to meet him.
Nothing seems to have changed.
An old woman we don't know is rocking on the porch.
A black girl, just 14...
is hanging out wash...
BENJAMIN Is your mother home?
THE GIRL She's gettin' supper ready....
THE GIRL He goes up the porch, inside....
Some old folks are in the front room...
Nobody we know...
He moves by them into the kitchen...
the stovetop smoking and gurgling...
He goes into the dining room...
Queenie is busy setting the table...
He watches her for a moment...
BENJAMIN Queenie...
BENJAMIN She turns, seeing him...
BENJAMIN she drops a plate...
QUEENIE Lord have mercy....you're home...
QUEENIE She runs to embrace him...
QUEENIE We see she's aged...
QUEENIE the eight years he's been gone...
QUEENIE and the 25 years or so since we've known her...
QUEENIE now in her fifties...
THE GIRL'S (V.0.) Who is that mama?
THE GIRL'S (V.0.) The Girl comes inside...
THE GIRL'S (V.0.) curious...
QUEENIE Your brother, Benjamin...
THE GIRL I didn't know he was my brother.
QUEENIE There's a shit load of things you don't know...
QUEENIE But her interest is in Benjamin....
QUEENIE (CONT'D) You look like you've been born again...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) you're younger than the springtime...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) I think that preacher laid the hands on you brought you a second life...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) I knew the moment I saw you -- you were special...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) Every night I got on my knees asking the Good Lord to bring you back safely.
QUEENIE (CONT'D) Remember what I told you...?
BENJAMIN You never know what's comin' for you.
BENJAMIN And they both share a good laugh at her homily...
BENJAMIN glad to be together once again.
QUEENIE Did you learn anything worth repeating?
BENJAMIN I saw a lot of things.
BENJAMIN She touches the scar, from the bullet, on his forehead.
QUEENIE You seen some pain.
QUEENIE He nods.
QUEENIE (CONT'D) Some joy too?
QUEENIE (CONT'D) He nods, that too.
QUEENIE (CONT'D) And she holds him again.
BENJAMIN Where's Tizzy?
QUEENIE Mr. Weathers died in his sleep one night last April.
QUEENIE He's sleeping comfortably now in the cemetery on St.
QUEENIE James street, God rest his soul...
BENJAMIN I'm so sorry...
BENJAMIN She turns from him so as not to cry....
QUEENIE There's only one or two of them left now...
QUEENIE They all just about new...
QUEENIE waitin' their turn like everybody else...
QUEENIE I am so glad to have I you back.
QUEENIE Now we got to find you some proper work and get you married right...
QUEENIE And as she goes about readying the table for dinner, humming to herself...
Benjamin sitting with a row of oldsters.
And feeling out of place, out of time, he gets up and goes inside.
We see Benjamin playing the piano in the parlor, the particular tune the Woman had taught him...
an old man sitting nearby, seemingly listening...
Queenie, looking in...
QUEENIE You're wasting your time...
QUEENIE he's stone deaf...
QUEENIE You'll be staying in what was Mrs. DeSeroux's room now, you're too much of a man to stay in the attic anymore.
QUEENIE She goes about her business...
QUEENIE And as Benjamin goes back to playing the piano for the deaf man...
QUEENIE playing for himself...
We see Mr. Daws, much older now, asleep in an easy chair.
Benjamin standing at the familiar window, listening to the silence of the house...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It's a funny thing about coming home.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Smells the same.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Looks the same.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Feels the same.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Mr. Daws awakens.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Seeing Benjamin.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) As if he never left.
MR. DAWS Did I ever tell you I've been struck by lightning seven times.
MR. DAWS Once I was sitting in my truck listening to the radio.
MR. DAWS And we see just that Mr. Daws sitting in his truck getting belted by lightning.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) You realize what's changed, is you...
While Benjamin stands locking out the window:
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) And one evening, not long after I had been back...
We see Benjamin, coming down the stairs.
He happens to glance out a casement window...
He slows...
He can just see part of a TAXI coming to stop at the gate.
He moves to the next landing...where he can see a figure is getting out of the cab...
The figure of a young woman, wearing a beret, a dark coat and lace up boots...
She strides through the gate...
It takes us a moment to recognize her...
the leggy thirteen year old girl is gone...
replaced by a confident woman in her early twenties...
with her red hair and her blue eyes she could be no one else but DAISY.
Benjamin follows her progress, moving through the parlor, watching her out the screened windows...
She moves gracefully past the porch with its swings...
The unnamed woman's old dog, smelling her, comes to greet her...
Daisy going around to the back of the house...
Benjamin moving to the back door, and just as Daisy starts to knock...
Benjamin opening it...
Momentarily startled, she doesn't recognize him....
and asks...
DAISY Oh, excuse me...
DAISY is Queenie here...?
BENJAMIN Daisy...
BENJAMIN it's me, Benjamin.
BENJAMIN She hardly can believe her eyes...
DAISY Benjamin...Oh my God it's you...
DAISY Of course it's you...
DAISY They embrace, and there's a moment when the touch is not just of old friends, but something different...
DAISY and they both, in that moment recognize that things will never be the same...
DAISY Daisy, over-hugging him...
DAISY the way young people do...
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin, how are you?
DAISY (CONT'D) It's been such a long time...
DAISY (CONT'D) There's so much I want to know...
DAISY (CONT'D) When did you come back?
BENJAMIN Just a few weeks ago...
DAISY I spoke to Queenie...she told me you were in the war...somewhere at sea...
DAISY I was so worried about you...
BENJAMIN I'm okay.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) When I had left she was a girl...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) and a woman had taken her place...
BENJAMIN I can't get over you -- You are so lovely...
DAISY You stopped writing.
BENJAMIN I feel terrible about it...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Now that I see you I feel even worse...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Look at you...Daisy Fuller...
Daisy's still.
She touches her old face.
DAISY ...Beautiful.
CAROLINE He said, "The most beautiful," Mother.
DAISY What else did he say about...
CAROLINE He said...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "...Everything, in that moment, had changed between us..."
Benjamin and Daisy going up the back stairs...
DAISY I can't get over you're home...
DAISY I've been planning to come by for awhile...
DAISY my grandmother, you remember Grandma Fuller...
DAISY of course you remember her...
DAISY she passed away...
BENJAMIN I heard that...
BENJAMIN I'm sorry...
DAISY I've been wanting to get some of her things...
DAISY ...They go into her grandmother's room...
Her grandmother's things are in boxes neatly stacked in a corner, waiting to be taken away...
Daisy starts to go through them...
Benjamin gives her a hand...
As they go through things...
DAISY I can't believe I open the door, and you're actually standing there...It must be fate...
DAISY What do they call it, "Kismet"?
DAISY I read a book about a man named Edgar Cayce, a psychic, everything is predetermined...I like to think it's fate.
DAISY What do you think, Benjamin?
BENJAMIN I don't know how it works, but I'm sure glad it happened...
BENJAMIN They inadvertently touch...
BENJAMIN the electricity of friction...
BENJAMIN both aware of the closeness...
BENJAMIN they move ever so slightly apart...
DAISY Have you been to New York...?
DAISY It's just across the bridge from me...
DAISY I can actually see the Empire State Building if I stand on my bed...
DAISY Where have you been?
DAISY Tell me everything.
DAISY The last time you wrote you said you were in Russia?
DAISY I always wanted to go to Russia...
DAISY Is it as cold as they say...?
DAISY You wrote you met somebody...
DAISY did it work out...?
BENJAMIN Remember this?
BENJAMIN He's comes upon the BOOK her grandmother had read to them, Rudyard Kipling's "Just So."
BENJAMIN She sits on the bed...
BENJAMIN Benjamin sitting beside her...
BENJAMIN the two shoulder to shoulder...
BENJAMIN Daisy looking through the book...
BENJAMIN and reading....
DAISY ...This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo at five in the afternoon..."
DAISY She looks at him.
DAISY (CONT'D) You don't look like an old man anymore...You always said you were different...
DAISY (CONT'D) I think you must be...
DAISY (CONT'D) He doesn't say anything.
DAISY (CONT'D) The two of them sitting with their backs to us like the old friends they are...They touch...
DAISY (CONT'D) acutely aware of their proximity and before it can go any further...
BENJAMIN Are you hungry?
BENJAMIN Would you like to get something to eat?
DAISY I would love that...
DAISY And the moment's gone...
...And we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion...
and Daisy, dressed for the night, glides out...
a man helping her...
and we see Benjamin a step behind getting out of the car...
dressed to the nines...
hair slicked, elegant...
but nonetheless, a step behind...
And we hear Daisy's voice, from somewhere else...
DAISY'S (V.0.) ...I danced for a man named Ballenchine...He's a famous choreographer.
DAISY'S (V.0.) He said I had a perfect line.
DAISY'S (V.0.) They asked Ballenchine to describe what he did.
DAISY'S (V.0.) He said, "I'm a carpenter."
DAISY'S (V.0.) Isn't that amazing?
DAISY'S (V.0.) In one of his rehearsals a dancer fell.
DAISY'S (V.0.) He put it into the production.
DAISY'S (V.0.) Can you imagine that in a classical ballet?
DAISY'S (V.0.) A dancer intentionally falling?
DAISY'S (V.0.) He isn't the only one, Agnes DeMille, Lincoln Kirstein, Richard Pleasant, Lucia Chase...There's a whole new word for dance now, it's called abstract..."
DAISY'S (V.0.) The door to the restaurant held open for Daisy...
DAISY'S (V.0.) another man showing her inside...
DAISY'S (V.0.) Benjamin forgotten for the slightest of moments at the door...
DAISY'S (V.0.) going after her.
A crowded New Orleans restaurant.
Daisy as a maitre d in slow motion is showing her to a table...
Men's, and even women's, eyes following her...
DAISY'S (V.0.) ...They have torn up all the conventions...
DAISY'S (V.0.) the straight up and down style, all the things that bound dancers...It's not about the formality of the dance...the classical structure...it's about what the dancer's feeling...there are no rules; the movement can be tense or relaxed, abrupt or flowing, carefree or somber, it may suggest love or hate, attraction or repulsion.
DAISY'S (V.0.) The unexpected shifts of weight or energy -- not just to shock but to reinvent tradition...putting the familiar form to new and unexpected uses.
DAISY'S (V.0.) It's so basic Just you alone with your body...
DAISY'S (V.0.) They reach a table...
DAISY'S (V.0.) A chair in slow motion swept out for her to sit...
DAISY'S (V.0.) another man in slow motion putting a napkin in her lap...
DAISY (V.O) They understand America's vigor and physicality -- they understand the freshness of the American people at their most modern, at their best.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) And she told me about this world that she was so attracted to...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) names that didn't mean a thing to me...I didn't really hear very much of what she was saying.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) We watch them at the table...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) Benjamin listening, appreciating her...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) her face aglow with the intensity and the passion of youth...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) Caviar is brought over...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) vodka...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) She screws up her mouth not wanting to eat...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) We can sense he's telling her, what he's learned from Elizabeth Abbott, how to savor it...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) He feeds her a spoonful...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) They drink the vodka washing it down...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) she laughs, delighted...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) And we now hear what she is saying...
DAISY Oh my god, I've been just talking about myself...
BENJAMIN I'm enjoying listening...
BENJAMIN She takes out a cigarette...
BENJAMIN He instinctively looks for matches, a man gets there first, lighting her cigarette for her...
BENJAMIN he watches the smoke curl around her...
BENJAMIN appreciating her...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I didn't know you smoked...
DAISY I'm old enough.
DAISY I`m old enough for a lot of things....
BENJAMIN Yes you are...
We see Benjamin and Daisy, their silhouettes walking through the park...
She puts her arm around his shoulder...
being close to him...
DAISY I have to go back tomorrow...
DAISY I wish I could stay...
DAISY They reach a GAZEBO...
DAISY Not a soul around...
DAISY They stand for a moment in the silence...
DAISY (CONT'D) In New York we stay up all night...
DAISY (CONT'D) I eat breakfast in a diner on Houston with red booths and watch the sun come up over the buildings...
DAISY (CONT'D) there's always something to do...
DAISY (CONT'D) Which is in stark contrast to Benjamin's life...
DAISY (CONT'D) Daisy, takes off her shoes...
DAISY (CONT'D) Dancers...
DAISY (CONT'D) don't need costumes or scenery.
DAISY (CONT'D) And showing him what she's been telling him about, she does a dance for him...
DAISY (CONT'D) I could imagine dancing completely naked...
DAISY (CONT'D) Daisy, dancing for him...
DAISY (CONT'D) While she dances...
DAISY (CONT'D) Have you read "D.H.
DAISY (CONT'D) Lawrence," his books were banned...
DAISY (CONT'D) The words are like making love....
DAISY (CONT'D) He stands, hands in his pockets appreciating her...
DAISY (CONT'D) she moves closer to him...
DAISY (CONT'D) She comes next to him and she kisses him...
DAISY (CONT'D) and when he doesn't respond...
DAISY (CONT'D) she tries a different tact...
DAISY (CONT'D) In our group...
DAISY (CONT'D) you have to trust people...
DAISY (CONT'D) not be afraid...
DAISY (CONT'D) Sex...
DAISY (CONT'D) is a big part of it...
DAISY (CONT'D) A lot of the dancers...
DAISY (CONT'D) are lesbians...
DAISY (CONT'D) A woman wanted me to sleep with her....
DAISY (CONT'D) He's quiet.
DAISY (CONT'D) Does that upset you?
BENJAMIN Which part?
DAISY That someone wanted to sleep with me.
BENJAMIN People should want to sleep with you...
BENJAMIN You're very desirable...
DAISY Let's go back to the house...
DAISY or get a room somewhere...
DAISY we can put down your coat...
DAISY She takes his hand, as if to lead him to the dark of the park...
DAISY There's nothing he'd like more...
DAISY but...
BENJAMIN It's not that I don't want to...
BENJAMIN I just can't...
BENJAMIN not tonight....Its just not...
DAISY I'm old enough.
DAISY And despite how available she is, how desirable she is...
BENJAMIN Go back to New York, Daisy...
BENJAMIN Be with the people you are so fond of...
BENJAMIN You can only be young once...
DAISY Do you think you are too old for me...
DAISY I've been with older men...
DAISY And when he still doesn't respond...
DAISY Daisy, rejected, takes up her shoes...
DAISY And she starts off...
DAISY Benjamin coming beside her...
DAISY but they're not really walking together anymore...
DAISY and the time for them, this time, has gone away...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) You only get so many chances to be with someone...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I let her go...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) and I missed it...
Daisy, caught in the distant time...
DAISY You look so handsome in that suit...
DAISY your hair...
DAISY A Nurse looks in...
THE NURSE They're sayin' the hurricane's going to miss us...
THE NURSE blow right on by...
CAROLINE Oh, that's great.
CAROLINE The Nurse goes off down the hall, her voice telling people the good news...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Isn't that good news, Mother?
CAROLINE (CONT'D) But Daisy is in still another place and another time...
DAISY Good news?
CAROLINE The hurricane.
CAROLINE It is going to miss us.
DAISY I'll just stay under the blankets with my mother.
DAISY She said nothing would happen to me.
DAISY She looks at the book.
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin?
CAROLINE Would you like me to keep reading?
CAROLINE Daisy nods.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) He said, "Things were becoming different for me..."
Benjamin lying on his bed, his glasses on, reading...
"D.H.
Lawrence"...
We see he's squinting...
We see his POINT OF VIEW, the print, is blurred...
He takes off the glasses, looks at the print...
and it's clear as a bell...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I didn't need glasses anymore...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) And we see Benjamin, naked, standing in front of a full length mirror, looking at himself, studying himself....
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) My hair had very little gray and grew like weeds...
(CONT'D) My sense of smell was keener...
(CONT'D) my hearing more acute...
(CONT'D) I could walk further and faster...
(CONT'D) He can see outside an ambulance has arrived...
(CONT'D) to take away another of the old people...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) While everybody else was aging...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) I was getting younger...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) all alone...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) And as he quietly looks at himself...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) There's a KNOCK on the door..
A MAN'S (V.0.) Benjamin...
A MAN'S (V.0.) He puts something on, and opens the door.
A MAN'S (V.0.) And as if to underscore what he's just said, he sees THOMAS BUTTON in his fifties himself now, leaning on crutches, his feet bandaged, standing in the doorway...
THOMAS BUTTON Hello, Benjamin...
THOMAS BUTTON Do you remember me?
BENJAMIN Of course, Mr. Button...
BENJAMIN What happened to you?
THOMAS BUTTON My foot was infected...
THOMAS BUTTON I'm afraid they had to remove it...
THOMAS BUTTON Welcome home, my friend.
The bar and restaurant crowded with men, many with various kinds of handicaps from the war, drinking away their demons...
And we see Benjamin and Thomas sitting at a table...
thick steaks, baked potatoes, drinks at their elbows...
BENJAMIN You're still drinking Sazerac with whiskey instead of brandy.
THOMAS BUTTON I'm a man of habit.
BENJAMIN Are you still visiting the house on Bourbon street?
THOMAS BUTTON Not for a long time.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I told him about my life...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) about my time at war...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) and he told me how he had devoted his business to making buttons for the war effort...
THOMAS BUTTON The war has been kind to the button industry...
THOMAS BUTTON we had gone from making forty thousand buttons a day to making two hundred and fifty thousand...
THOMAS BUTTON We employed ten times the number of workers...
THOMAS BUTTON We were operating around the clock...
THOMAS BUTTON And he quiets...
THOMAS BUTTON the sound of the busy restaurant...
THOMAS BUTTON And after some moments Thomas tells him...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I don't know how much longer I have to live...
BENJAMIN I'm sorry to hear that, Mr.
BENJAMIN Button.
BENJAMIN And it seems like he is about to tell Benjamin the entire truth...
BENJAMIN but he can't bring himself and instead...
THOMAS BUTTON I don't have any people.
THOMAS BUTTON I keep to myself.
THOMAS BUTTON I -- I'm frightened.
THOMAS BUTTON I hope you won't mind...
THOMAS BUTTON but whenever it's possible...
THOMAS BUTTON I would enjoy your company...
BENJAMIN I'll do what I can, Mr. Button.
BENJAMIN They quietly eat.
THOMAS BUTTON Tell me Benjamin, do you know anything about buttons?
BENJAMIN Just what holds my shirt on.
An old brick building with a painting on its side of a woman sewing on a button...
"Button's Buttons."
A driver waits outside of a "town car".
We see Thomas unlocking a door.
THOMAS BUTTON ...
THOMAS BUTTON comes from the French, "bouton," meaning a bud, or any round object...
THOMAS BUTTON They come into a corridor.
THOMAS BUTTON Thomas unlocking another door.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) They were originally decorative, jewelry sewn on clothing...
They walk through the quiet factory...
THOMAS BUTTON The practice of buttoning originated in the 13th century...
THOMAS BUTTON when baggy clothing was replaced with more form-fitting clothes...
THOMAS BUTTON Thomas, on his crutches...past the lines of work benches...
THOMAS BUTTON Mannequins in uniforms of the armed services...
THOMAS BUTTON with their various gold and silver buttons...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Button's Buttons has been in our family for one hundred and twenty- four years.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) My grandfather was a tailor.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) He had a small shop in Richmond.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) After the Civil War he came to New Orleans.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) My father saw the wisdom of making our own buttons.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) The tailor shop grew to this...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) And today...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I can't sew a stitch.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Benjamin is interested, but the obvious question is...
BENJAMIN It's all very interesting.
BENJAMIN But what do you want from me?
THOMAS BUTTON I said, our family has been in the business for a hundred and twenty- four years.
BENJAMIN Our family?
BENJAMIN And it's as if he has opened a flood gate...
THOMAS BUTTON You are my family.
THOMAS BUTTON Benjamin, you are my son.
THOMAS BUTTON And tears run down his anguished face...
THOMAS BUTTON Benjamin's still...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I am so sorry not to have told you before...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Benjamin hasn't moved.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) The words ring in his ears.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) You were born the night the great war ended...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Your mother died giving birth to you...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I thought...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I thought you were a monster...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I left you on the back steps of a house...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I promised your mother I'd make sure you were safe...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I should never have abandoned you...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Benjamin's dead quiet...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) He looks at this man, his father...
BENJAMIN My mother?
We see Benjamin and Thomas in a hallway leading to the kitchen of the large house...
The hallway filled with: photographs of the Button Family.
Thomas pointing out relatives...
Family photographs...
THOMAS BUTTON ...A great uncle, from Germany.
THOMAS BUTTON All of the men in the family at the Lake House...
THOMAS BUTTON 1915, three years before you were born.
THOMAS BUTTON A photograph of an old man sitting in a wooden deck chair on the dock of a lake.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Your grandfather at the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) When I was a boy I would love to wake up before anybody else and run down to the lake to watch the day begin.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) It was as if I was the only one alive.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) And they've come to a young Woman's photograph...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) who could only be Benjamin's mother.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) He stops...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I fell in love with her the first time I saw her.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Your mother's name was Caroline Murphy.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) She was 20.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) She worked in your grandfather's kitchen...She was from Dublin...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Her father, your maternal grandfather, was a chimney sweep...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) He died in the flu epidemic of 1900...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Caroline came with her mother, two sisters, and four brothers in 1903 to live in New Orleans.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) They stop at the kitchen door.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I would find reasons to go to the kitchen...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) just to look at her...
He does just that...
Looking through the round window into the empty kitchen...
as if she was there those years ago...
as if she was still there...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) The happiest day of my life was April 25th, 1918 the day I married your mother.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) They move along the hallway...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Benjamin looking at the
photographs...
his bloodlines...
After some moments:
BENJAMIN Why didn't you tell me?
THOMAS BUTTON I made a mistake.
THOMAS BUTTON Benjamin looks at him.
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Come and take your rightful place...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) with your family...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) with me...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) When Benjamin doesn't say anything...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) We can catch up for all the lost time...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) And when he still doesn't answer...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I'm planning on leaving everything I have to you...
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) His "bribe" strikes a nerve.
BENJAMIN I better go.
THOMAS BUTTON Where are you going?
BENJAMIN Home.
BENJAMIN Benjamin turns his back and walks out.
Benjamin standing by the door, Queenie sitting up in her bed...
QUEENIE He's what?!
QUEENIE All those years he's creeping around here, and never tells us who he is?!!
QUEENIE I thought he was just queer or somethin' comin' around here...
QUEENIE always askin' for you...
QUEENIE He left us $18 that night you was found...
QUEENIE Eighteen ratty ass dollars and a dirty diaper...!
QUEENIE Now he wants to be your father?
QUEENIE He wants you to sit at his side...!
QUEENIE He wants your forgiveness!
QUEENIE I won't ever forgive him for any of it...
QUEENIE God's the only one that can forgive him!
QUEENIE Now I got to get up early with Mrs. Hamilton...
QUEENIE or she gonna drown...
QUEENIE ...He thinks he can just show up, and everything gonna be fine and dandy, everybody gonna be friends...
QUEENIE He got another thing coming...
QUEENIE And with that she turns over, to go back to sleep, Benjamin quietly leaves the room.
He climbs the back stairs to his room, as if he's carrying a terrible burden...
as he comes onto the hallway, Mr. Daws is sitting on a bench in the hall...
Seeing Benjamin...
MR. DAWS Did I ever tell you I was struck by lightning seven different times.
MR. DAWS Once, I was walking my dog along a country road.
MR. DAWS And we see just that, when suddenly he's struck by lightning.
MR. DAWS The dog, unharmed, licking his face.
DAWS (CONT'D) I'm blind in the one eye...I can't hardly hear...I get twitches and shakes out of nowhere...
DAWS (CONT'D) I lose my line of thought...
DAWS (CONT'D) but you know what...
DAWS (CONT'D) God, for some reason, keeps on sending me a wake-up...
DAWS (CONT'D) It's His way of reminding me I'm lucky to be alive...
DAWS (CONT'D) Storm's comin'.
DAWS (CONT'D) And gets up and pads off into his room.
DAWS (CONT'D) Benjamin, left in the hallway...He goes over to look out the window, like the boy we remember looking out at the street lights...
DAWS (CONT'D) the street...
We see Benjamin being let in by a Butler into the fashionable home.
Benjamin in the dark hallway, quietly walking among the photographs of "his" family.
He goes up the staircase.
He goes to his father's room.
He quietly opens the door.
The room's dark, his father asleep.
He goes to his father's bed.
His father's frail figure.
BENJAMIN Thomas...
BENJAMIN Thomas awakens...seeing Benjamin...
We see Benjamin wheeling his father in a wheelchair out of the house...And...
The endless lake.
And we see Mr. Button's chauffeured car driving along the lake.
The car's stopped at a chain across the driveway of an old summer home.
Benjamin helps to put Thomas into his wheelchair.
He wheels him up the long drive to the house.
All closed up.
Shuttered.
There are steps that lead down to the lake.
He starts to wheel his father down the steps.
The steps are too steep for the wheelchair.
Benjamin reaches, picking his father up out of the chair.
He carries him down the steps, but that too is arduous...
And he puts his father on his back...His father holding onto his son, as Benjamin carries him on his back down the steps to the dock.
There's an old wooden deck chair.
He helps his father sit in the chair.
And as his father sits for the last time, watching the lake...
THOMAS BUTTON Thank you, Benjamin.
THOMAS BUTTON Benjamin sitting at a distance behind him...Both of them watching the day begin...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) You can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went...You can swear, curse the fates, regret everything you ever did...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) but when it comes to the end...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) You have to let go...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And as his father shuts his eyes, sitting in the sun.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) I buried him in the Button family plot.
We see Benjamin standing at his father's gravesite in the family plot, with ornate headstones...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I had a tailor sew onto his best coat -- a button for every year of his life....fifty-five of them...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) all different, pearl and silver, brass and wood...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) in case he lost one along the way...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And as he stands at the gravesite...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) He hears something.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Queenie has come to be with him...to comfort him...
QUEENIE Don't you suffer alone for it.
QUEENIE She takes his arm, always there for him.
QUEENIE (CONT'D) It's a beautiful cemetery...
QUEENIE (CONT'D) And buried here right next to your mother.
BENJAMIN His wife.
BENJAMIN And as they stand at the gravesite...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I went to pay a visit to the button factory.
We see Benjamin with an elderly woman, MS.
SANDERSON, standing at the railing of a mezzanine above the factory work floor...
looking down upon the workers, exclusively women, and exclusively white women, making buttons...The women, seeing him, look up, and there's a sudden hush...
BENJAMIN My name is Benjamin, Benjamin...
BENJAMIN Button...
BENJAMIN They stare up at him...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) As you know, my father...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) It still sounds strange to him.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) ...My father, Thomas Button...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) recently passed...
After a moment:
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) He asked that I take over the day to day operation of Button's Buttons.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) They silently stare up at him....
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Well, I don't know the first thing about buttons...and I don't know a thing about business...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Button's Buttons has been in my father's family for over 100 years.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) It could not have survived without people like you.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) My father asked me to tell you how much he appreciated the hard work you put in for him and his company for so many years.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Dead still...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) And after a moment;
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I have decided that all of you -- his loyal employees, will have a share, depending on your length of employment, in the ownership of this factory, his legacy.
ONE OF THE WOMEN We're the owners now?
BENJAMIN That's about it.
BENJAMIN They're literally dumbfounded.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Mrs. Sanderson will explain how everything works and will answer any of your questions...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) And with that he turns, walking away...Having "given away the store"...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) the workers in disbelief looking up at him...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And I went to New York.
We see a cab pull up and Benjamin, in a nice suit, flowers in hand, daisies, gets out, hurrying into The Majestic Theater, the marquee telling us "CAROUSEL," is performing.
Benjamin, coming in late, being shown to his seat.
And we see the production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical "Carousel," with Mielziner's seminal stage design, as choreographed by Agnes De Mille...
And we see the dancer is Daisy...dancing with the man of her dreams, the "bad boy" carnival barker...
while Benjamin watches her.
We see Benjamin, flowers in hand, making his way through a crowded backstage corridor filled with friends and well- wishers giving cast members congratulations.
He comes to the door...
to the attention of a STAGEHAND...
BENJAMIN I'm a friend of Daisy's...
BENJAMIN The man matter-of-factly opens the door...
BENJAMIN A dressing room crowded with dancers changing out of their Costumes...
BENJAMIN He calls out...
THE MAN Daisy has company...
THE MAN We can hear Daisy's name being said...Benjamin waiting...
THE MAN He sees Daisy, in a robe, coming through the room....
DAISY Somebody's looking for me?...
DAISY ...And she sees it's Benjamin.
DAISY And rather than excited to see him...
DAISY She's startled he's there...
DAISY and not altogether pleased about him showing up...
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin...
DAISY (CONT'D) What are you doing here?
DAISY (CONT'D) And he realizes, as most of us have in one love affair or another, whatever his expectations may have been, his fantasy, is not the reality...
BENJAMIN I thought I'd come visit...
BENJAMIN spend some time with you if I could...
DAISY I wish you would have called...
DAISY You caught me by surprise.
DAISY He gives her the flowers, the daisies.
BENJAMIN I couldn't take my eyes off of you...
BENJAMIN you were mesmerizing...
DAISY That's so nice of you to say...
DAISY These are lovely...
DAISY Thank you...
There's an awkward moment...
and...
DAISY (CONT'D) I better get changed...
DAISY (CONT'D) a group of us are going to a party...
DAISY (CONT'D) would you like to come...?
BENJAMIN Somebody told me about a restaurant I thought you might enjoy...
BENJAMIN I made a reservation...
BENJAMIN Just in case --
DAISY ...all the dancers go out together after the show...
DAISY You're welcome to come with us...
DAISY There'll be all sorts of interesting people...
DAISY Let me get changed.
DAISY And she runs back inside the dressing room...
DAISY Benjamin left to stand in the hallway....
A loft elevator opens depositing Benjamin and Daisy along with a bunch of people into a large loft...
crowded with her friends, dancers and show people, musicians, predominantly young people, straight and gay, beatniks before there were beatniks, bohemians...
Music playing...
People pressed together, having to shout to talk...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And I met her friends...
DAISY I'll get you a drink...
DAISY As she turns to a kitchen to get him a drink, she is startled as a young man, DAVID, suddenly grabs her, kissing her, a kiss that's not intended to be platonic...
DAISY Daisy obviously involved with him...
DAISY but embarrassed by the intimacy in front of Benjamin and not wanting to hurt his feelings...
DAISY she pulls awkwardly away from him...
DAISY (CONT'D) This is my friend David...
DAISY (CONT'D) David dances with our company too...
DAISY (CONT'D) This is the man I've told you about, Benjamin...
DAISY (CONT'D) They shake hands...
DAISY (CONT'D) Daisy, wanting to escape.
DAISY (CONT'D) I'll get you that drink.
DAISY (CONT'D) - -
DAISY (CONT'D) ...she goes into the kitchen...
DAVID You were her grandmother's friend or something like that...?
BENJAMIN Something like that.
BENJAMIN And Daisy comes back out with a drink for him...
BENJAMIN and one of her own...
BENJAMIN But before she can give him his drink, a woman takes it from her...
BENJAMIN and starts to dance with her...
BENJAMIN but not with her...
BENJAMIN the way dancers do...
BENJAMIN and many of the dancers are dancing just because they feel like it...
BENJAMIN David, comes to dance with Daisy...
BENJAMIN Benjamin standing watching Daisy dancing with him...
BENJAMIN as only dancers can...
BENJAMIN in complete control of their bodies and yet totally uninhibited...
BENJAMIN Benjamin sees David kiss her...
BENJAMIN and his jealousy getting the best of him, he turns and leaves...
Daisy in her turban...
listening to Caroline read..
DAISY I knew I'd hurt you...
DAISY Maybe I intended to...
Benjamin on his way out of the apartment coming along the street.
Daisy running after him...
DAISY I did what you told me to...
DAISY enjoy my life...
DAISY I'm only going to be young once...
DAISY I had no idea you were coming.
DAISY What did you think I was going to do...?
DAISY You can't expect me to just drop everything, Benjamin...
DAISY this is my life...
DAISY And we see DAVID and a group of her dancer friends have come outside down the way into the street...
DAISY looking for cabs...
DAVID There's a party downtown we're going to...
DAISY Why don't you come with us, Benjamin...
DAISY There'll be a lot of musicians, interesting people there....
DAISY You'll have a good time...
BENJAMIN I came here to tell you I made a mistake before...A day doesn't go by that I don't regret it...It's not the way I felt...I should have never let you go...I came because I hoped I could be with you...
DAVID Daisy, you going to come...?
DAVID Cabs have pulled up...
DAVID She's torn...
DAVID between her life and some other life...
DAVID Benjamin, recognizing her conflict...
BENJAMIN Do you love him?
Daisy in bed...
CAROLINE Did you Mother?
CAROLINE Daisy snaps back to the reality of the room...
CAROLINE Starts to put the pieces together...
DAISY I think so.
DAISY I think I do.
DAISY We see the dancers scrambling getting into the taxis...
BENJAMIN Okay.
BENJAMIN Okay...
BENJAMIN I'll see you in New Orleans...
He turns to go...
she's motionless, caught between the two worlds...
And we expect her to yell after him, to stop him...
But instead, she does what we all do in these moments, what feels good at the time...
She runs to be with her friends...
She gets into a taxi...
The cab drives by him as they leave...
Daisy turned to look out the back window...
looking back at him...
He waves...
letting her go...
And another chance for them is missed...
The street's quiet.
And hands in his pockets, a middle-aged man going on 26...
he walks off into the night...
DAISY He came to tell me his father had died.
CAROLINE You couldn't have known.
DAISY I was 23...I just didn't care...
DAISY She's quiet with her thoughts...
DAISY and, remembering, she hums to herself some distant memory of music...
DAISY (CONT'D) ...There are some photographs I think...
DAISY (CONT'D) the zipper part of the large bag...
DAISY (CONT'D) Caroline goes to the suitcases...
DAISY (CONT'D) she comes back with a manila envelope...
DAISY (CONT'D) Daisy dumps them out...and we see they're photographs of Daisy dancing at the height of her abilities...
CAROLINE I've never seen these...
CAROLINE You never talked about your dancing very much...
CAROLINE Daisy looks at the photographs...
DAISY I was as good as I was ever going to be.
DAISY For five years...
DAISY I danced everywhere...
DAISY London, Prague, Vienna, and I was the only American invited to dance with the Bolshoi...
DAISY It was glorious...
And we see Daisy, five years older, her arm inside a tall young blond Russian dancer's, ANITOLY, crossing a snowy street in Moscow...
DAISY (V.O.) But Benjamin was never far from my thoughts...
Daisy in bed, the young Russian dancer Anitoly lying beside her, asleep...
Daisy, looking off...
DAISY'S (V.0.) I'd find myself saying...
DAISY Goodnight, Benjamin...
We see Benjamin in bed, turning off the light...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I'd find myself saying...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) Goodnight, Daisy.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) And as they both lie in their beds...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) thinking of the other...
DAISY What did he say?
CAROL "Life wasn't very complicated..."
We see Benjamin on Tizzy's old motorcycle riding along the backroads of the endless swamps known as the bayou -
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) If you want you could say I was looking for something...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) As he rides away...
(CONT'D) Life went on as usual.
Benjamin in work clothes on a ladder, painting some old window shutters...
Queenie opens the window...
to tell him...
QUEENIE Mrs. La Tourneau just passed away.
QUEENIE Benjamin nods.
QUEENIE Queenie shuts the window.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) Until one day...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) A Messenger on a bicycle rides up...
A WESTERN UNION MESSENGER I have a telegram for Mr. Benjamin Button...
BENJAMIN That would be me....
BENJAMIN He comes down the ladder.
BENJAMIN The Messenger gives him the telegram and getting his tip, rides off, Benjamin opens the telegram.
We see Benjamin, carrying a suitcase, running along a street in Paris...
looking for an address...
He stops, in front of an old HOSPITAL...
runs up the stairs...
Benjamin crosses an old tile floor to a reception desk...
He asks for Daisy...
a Woman calls up for him...
THE WOMAN It will just be a minute...
THE WOMAN please have a seat...
THE WOMAN Benjamin sits in the waiting room.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) Sometimes we are on a collision course and we just don't know it...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) Whether it's by accident or by design, there's not a thing we can do about it...
(CONT'D) A woman in Paris was on her way to go shopping...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) But she had forgotten her coat...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) and went back to get it...

BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Daisy, showing her friend her dance move, doing a pirouette...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...and the taxi would have driven by them...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) And we see the taxi turning the corner, driving safely by them...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) and becoming a ghost...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) of what might have been...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) But life being what it is...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) a series of intersecting lives and incidents...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) Out of anyone's control...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) the taxi did not go by...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) and the driver momentarily was distracted...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) The Driver wipes cigarette ash from his shirt front momentarily looking down...
(CONT'D) And he didn't see Daisy crossing the street...
(CONT'D) Daisy and her friend crossing the Street, Daisy doing the Pirouette...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...and that taxi hit Daisy...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) And we see just that...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Daisy being slammed into by the taxi...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) thrown a distance...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) lying crumpled in the Street...
We see Benjamin coming into the hospital room in France...Daisy, fully immobilized, lying in a hospital bed...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And her leg was crushed...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She's still, her eyes closed.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Sensing him, she stirs.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And then she sees him.
BENJAMIN Hello, Daisy...
DAISY Who told you?
BENJAMIN Your friend wired me.
DAISY That was very kind of you...
DAISY to come all the way here, to see that I was alright.
BENJAMIN You would have done the same for me...
BENJAMIN And her first reaction, to how young he is...
DAISY My God, look at you.
DAISY You're perfect....
Which she isn't...
She's quiet, and she suddenly says:
DAISY (CONT'D) I wish you hadn't.
DAISY (CONT'D) I wish you hadn't come here.
DAISY (CONT'D) He's dead still.
DAISY (CONT'D) I don't want you to see me like this...
DAISY (CONT'D) She turns over...
DAISY (CONT'D) as if she didn't see him he wouldn't be there...
DAISY (CONT'D) Before he can say anything...
DAISY (CONT'D) A Nurse comes in saying something in French...
DAISY (CONT'D) She pulls the curtains around the bed...
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin waits...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Her leg had been broken in five places....
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) and with therapy, and time, she might be able to stand...maybe even walk...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) The Nurse leaves...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Benjamin comes into the circle of curtains...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It's reminiscent of when they sat under the table...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) the sheets over them...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) in their private world...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) But this time she lays in the hospital bed her back to him...
BENJAMIN I'll get a room...
BENJAMIN and once you can leave you'll come home with me to New Orleans.
BENJAMIN Where you can be with people who love you.
BENJAMIN She suddenly turns...
DAISY What home?
DAISY Who's we?
DAISY I'm not going back to New Orleans.
DAISY New Orleans is your home...
DAISY I don't have a home...
DAISY I haven't been home for five years...
DAISY I'm not going anywhere with you...
BENJAMIN Alright, I'll stay here in Paris...
BENJAMIN I'll help you with anything you need...
DAISY Benjamin...!
DAISY I know I'm feeling sorry for myself...
DAISY But it wasn't supposed to be like this...
DAISY (CONT'D) Do you understand, I don't want to be with you...
DAISY (CONT'D) I tried to tell you that in New York...
DAISY (CONT'D) You just don't listen...
BENJAMIN You'll change your mind.
DAISY We're not little children playing under the table...
DAISY Remember, when you came to New York.
DAISY You didn't belong there.
DAISY I didn't want to be with you then, I don't want to be with you now!
DAISY I want you to leave!
DAISY I'm not going anywhere with you!
DAISY I want you to stay out of my life!
DAISY And she turns away from him again...It's dead still...
DAISY and we look at her staring at the curtains...
DAISY And after some moments she turns back to look at Benjamin...
DAISY And there are just the curtains billowing in the breeze...
DAISY Benjamin is gone...
DAISY I was awfully cruel.
DAISY He didn't understand.
DAISY I couldn't have him see me that way...
DAISY She waits for Benjamin's response...
CAROLINE "I didn't leave right away..."
DAISY No?
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "I stayed in Paris for awhile, just to look out for her..."
Benjamin in Paris...
DAISY I never knew that.
Benjamin in Paris, "watching over her."
Daisy in bed...She winces with pain...
her breathing becoming ragged...
CAROLINE I'll get the nurse...
CAROLINE She goes into the hall...
CAROLINE Daisy left to deal with the remnants of her mortality...
CAROLINE The Nurse coming into the room...
CAROLINE Caroline behind her...
CAROLINE times her pulse.
THE NURSE Let's get you comfortable.
THE NURSE She raises the morphine level...straightens her covers...she stops before she leaves...motions to Caroline...Caroline going over to her.
THE NURSE (CONT'D) Pulse rate's slowing...She's getting less oxygen...You'll notice her struggle to breathe...Will you be alright?
THE NURSE (CONT'D) Caroline nods...The Nurse gives her a compassionate look and leaves...Caroline stands, her arms protectively across her chest, watching her mother...Daisy hums the particular ragtime song that Benjamin would play on the piano...She opens her eyes, as if not completely sure where she is...telling Caroline...
DAISY Every morning Monsieur Foley leaves eggs and bread and mil,.
DAISY There's a cafe across the street.
DAISY People sitting and drinking and talking...
DAISY I lay on my bed thinking about the rest of my life...
DAISY about people...
DAISY about home...
DAISY until I fall asleep.
DAISY She looks at Caroline as if to say, "What happened to him...?"
CAROLINE He said, "I went back..."
CAROLINE But then there are a whole lot of pages torn out...
CAROLINE She looks at a loose piece of paper...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "...I listened to the sound of the house..."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) I think I already read that...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) The next thing he wrote...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) he spilled something on it...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) It's hard to read...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Something about "sailing."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Does that make sense?
DAISY A man would go up and clean it.
DAISY Try and fix what was broken.
A man up on the clock doing just that.
Closing its face.
The cherubic angels pushing the hands on its way backwards...
"1960."
We see a SAILBOAT out on the lake...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S I learned to sail on an old boat of my father's from the Lake House...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S And we see Benjamin, the wind in his hair, sailing an old sailboat...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S And the change in his appearance is startling...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S His hair is without a trace of gray...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S His face with barely a wrinkle, chiseled...He is a healthy man in his 40s now...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) I can't lie, I did enjoy the company of a woman or two...
Benjamin and a Woman standing on the sidewalk outside a restaurant, in the middle of an ardent kiss...
As a taxi pulls up...
Benjamin at the door kissing another Woman goodbye...going home
MORNING, 1960 Benjamin's door opening...Another Woman, disheveled, coming out of his room...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) ...Or maybe three...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) Benjamin seeing her to the stairs...And as she starts down the stairs to leave...we see a cluster of old people, ready for the day, looking up at them...the woman making her way awkwardly down the stairs and out the door...Benjamin gives a little self conscious wave to the old timers and starts back into his room...He slows at a second story hallway window...looking outside at the walkway...the familiar street beyond...If we didn't know any better he seems to be waiting for someone to come home
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) And in the spring of 1962...
We see Benjamin riding the old motorcycle along the street on his way home...
leaves the motorcycle out in front...
He comes to the gate, opening it, coming into the yard, shutting the gate behind him, going up the walkway.
An Old Man is on the porch, quietly rocking.
And Queenie, for some reason is standing just outside the front door on the porch...
an apron in her hands...
She nods to Benjamin...
talking to the Old Man in the rocking chair...
but she seems to be watching Benjamin, as he walks around the house -- to the back door.
He takes off his dirty work boots, leaves them on the porch.
He hops the back steps, and starts to open the kitchen door, when it opens...
And DAISY, now 36, but still with her unmistakable blue eyes, is standing before him...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She came back.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) They look at each other in silence...and they simply smile, so glad to see each other after all the missing years...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) They embrace...for some time...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) and kiss...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) As people who haven't seen each other, and have thought about each other...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) for a very long time...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And it just is...no big symphonies, no endless skies...just, two people at a kitchen door in the middle of their lives...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) and the simplicity, just that, is what makes it real and breaks your heart.
A radio plays...
they sit at the kitchen table, eating dinner...
the conversation muted...
They don't know really where to begin, where did they leave oft...so they don't begin until they can....
DAISY Don't you want to know where I've been?
BENJAMIN No.
BENJAMIN I don't care where you've been -- I'm just happy you're back.
BENJAMIN And we see Queenie has come into the kitchen...
BENJAMIN in her nightgown now...
QUEENIE How come you didn't write or nothin'?
QUEENIE Just disappearing like that?
DAISY It was what I needed to do for myself.
QUEENIE I never took you to be selfish.
QUEENIE I hope I'm not wrong.
QUEENIE I'm not usually wrong about people.
QUEENIE And Queenie leaves the kitchen...
DAISY She's still taking care of you.
Benjamin slightly smiles.
They look at each other.
DAISY (CONT'D) You're not talking.
DAISY (CONT'D) You haven't said more than two words to me.
BENJAMIN I don't want to ruin it...
BENJAMIN And they sit quietly in the kitchen, looking at each other, silently eating...
Benjamin carries her bags upstairs.
They reach the third floor.
All the years seem to surround them.
They walk along the corridor to Daisy's room.
What was her grandmother's room.
She opens the door.
He sets her bags down.
Queenie despite her reservations has left some clean towels on the bed for her...
There's an inept quiet.
The two of them with nothing left to say...
And they listen to the quiet...
The house with its symphony of night noises...
BENJAMIN Goodnight.
BENJAMIN He is just at the door...
BENJAMIN when she says...
DAISY Sleep with me.
BENJAMIN Are you sure?
DAISY Yes.
DAISY He turns to her.
DAISY They look at each other.
DAISY And they kiss, A kiss that has waited for thirty years.
DAISY A kiss that has waited a lifetime.
DAISY And yes, there is passion...
DAISY and need...
DAISY but most particularly, the awkwardness of people discovering each other for the first time...
DAISY While he gently, tenderly, kisses her, undresses her..
DAISY (CONT'D) Are you sure you don't want to know?...
DAISY (CONT'D) While they kiss and caress each other.
DAISY (CONT'D) I lived in Lyon...
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin and Daisy undressing one another, touching, kissing...
DAISY (CONT'D) ...I learned to walk again
DAISY (CONT'D) Daisy and Benjamin, naked, passionately kissing...
DAISY (CONT'D) ...I worked in a flower shop...
DAISY (CONT'D) They lay on the bed, kissing, caressing...
DAISY (CONT'D) ...I went to American movies a lot.
DAISY (CONT'D) They kiss more and more passionately...And Benjamin about to make love to her hesitates...
DAISY (CONT'D) You won't hurt me...
DAISY (CONT'D) He kisses her scarred crooked leg.
DAISY (CONT'D) Kisses her body.
DAISY (CONT'D) And as they make love in the old bedroom...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I asked her to come with me...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) What follows feels like a HOME MOVIE...without any sound.
And we see the small sailboat out on the gulf coast...
BENJAMIN SUTTON'S (V.0,) We sailed into the Gulf...
BENJAMIN SUTTON'S (V.0,) along the Florida coast...
Daisy and Benjamin on the sailboat at a cove on the Florida coast.
They watch a ROCKET, soaring into space from Cape Caniveral.
As they watch it roar overhead, Benjamin marvels at its power...leaving its trail across the sky...Daisy, not so much interested, taking his arm, taking him back down below...
Daisy washing her hair off the side of the boat.
The boat anchored.
Benjamin and Daisy sitting on the deck having a picnic with just a single lamp for light.
The boat in still another cove.
Daisy and Benjamin in the water.
Just their eyes above the dark water looking only at each other.
Under millions of stars.
Benjamin and Daisy making love on a blanket on the deck...
Benjamin and Daisy asleep on a secluded beach.
The boat out on the water, Daisy sitting on the deck, the wind in her hair...
Benjamin at the wheel...threatening clouds on the horizon...
DAISY'S (V.0.) I'm so glad we didn't find one another when I was 26...
DAISY'S (V.0.) I'm glad we missed...
BENJAMIN'S (V.0.) Why do you say that?
DAISY'S (V.0.) It wasn't right...
A small Caribbean hotel.
We see Benjamin and Daisy sitting at a table drinking, talking in a nearly empty bar...
wind and rain lashing the hotel...
waiting out a tropical storm...
DAISY We wouldn't have this...
DAISY We wouldn't be here...
DAISY It happened when it was supposed to happen...
DAISY They look at each other...
BENJAMIN Relationships have a time and a place.
DAISY Don't say that.
BENJAMIN What I mean is...
BENJAMIN You don't usually get more than one chance.
BENJAMIN If you miss it, it's too late...
BENJAMIN and it's gone...
BENJAMIN We're lucky...
BENJAMIN we had more than one chance.
DAISY That's easy for you to say...
DAISY You'll have plenty of chances.
DAISY She tenderly touches his hand...
DAISY They look at each other...
DAISY And dedicating herself...
DAISY (CONT'D) I'm going to enjoy every moment I have with you...
DAISY (CONT'D) The waiter's come over.
BENJAMIN Have you ever had a Sazerac with whiskey not brandy?
DAISY'S I'm with you, aren't I?
DAISY'S I'll try anything.
DAISY'S And the wind changes direction, the rain coming in through the open windows of the bar, getting them wet...
DAISY'S people run for cover...
DAISY Bet I can stay out here longer than you can.
BENJAMIN Bet you can't.
BENJAMIN And as they both sit doggedly in the rain...
A white hotel room...
The storm shutters closed...
The wind and the rain banging at the shutters...
Daisy and Benjamin lying together on a bed out of the storm...
She touches his face as if for the first time...
DAISY You barely have a line, a crease, or a wrinkle...
DAISY Everyday I have more wrinkles you have less...
DAISY He touches her face.
BENJAMIN I love your wrinkles.
DAISY What does it feel like growing younger?
BENJAMIN I don't know...
BENJAMIN I'm always looking out of my own eyes...
BENJAMIN They're quiet, just the sound of the rain and the chattering shutters...
BENJAMIN She lays closer to him...
BENJAMIN warmly...
BENJAMIN She smiles...
DAISY Will you still love me when I can't stand straight...
DAISY when my skin grows old and spotted...
DAISY Benjamin laughs.
DAISY (CONT'D) Will you still love me when my step gets slow...
DAISY (CONT'D) when I sleep too much...
DAISY (CONT'D) when you have to push me in a chair...
DAISY (CONT'D) And his answer is...
BENJAMIN Will you still love me when I have pimples.
BENJAMIN When I think it's funny to make fart noises...
She laughs...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Will you still love me when I think all girls have cooties...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Will you still love me when I wet my bed at night...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Will you still love me when I'm afraid of things that aren't real...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) They hold each other...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) And Benjamin says...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) from what he's seen...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Nothing lasts...
DAISY Maybe some things last...
BENJAMIN I've never seen anything not come to an end...
DAISY Maybe it's something you can't see...
DAISY And a shutter slams open...
DAISY the rain and the wind coming into the room...
DAISY Benjamin gets up to close it...
DAISY He comes back into bed...
DAISY And Daisy, suddenly afraid...
DAISY (CONT'D) I'm cold, Benjamin...
DAISY (CONT'D) And as he holds her in the white room with the wind and the rain trying to get in, banging on the shutters...
The storm's died down...
Benjamin and Daisy falling asleep...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And you said...
DAISY Goodnight, Benjamin.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) And I said...
BENJAMIN Goodnight, Daisy...
DAISY Caroline?
CAROLINE I don't understand.
CAROLINE When did you meet Dad?
DAISY Dear Robert...
DAISY some time after that...
CAROLINE Did you ever tell him about this Benjamin?
DAISY He knew enough.
DAISY He loved me as I was.
DAISY I loved him for who he was.
DAISY What more was needed?
DAISY She trails off...
DAISY she's quiet...
DAISY and wanting to know what's next, reading on...
CAROLINE "That night, in the Caribbean I had a visitor..."
Benjamin and Daisy sleeping...
the shutters quietly talking on a breeze...
when one of the shutters SLAMS open as if somebody's come in...
Benjamin wakes up...
And he literally sees QUEENIE is sitting on the side of the bed beside him...
QUEENIE I wanted to tell you I love you and your mama's gone...
QUEENIE And she bends, sweetly kissing him...
QUEENIE And Benjamin rolls over...
QUEENIE His eyes come open...
QUEENIE Daisy sensing he's awake, awakening, murmurs...
DAISY Is anything wrong?
BENJAMIN Queenie came to tell me she loved me...
BENJAMIN and that my mother was gone.
DAISY ...go back to sleep...
DAISY As she caresses him...
DAISY falling back to sleep...
DAISY the shutters talking...
We see Daisy and Benjamin, with their few belongings, returning home...
They go up the walkway...
Benjamin trots up the steps, opens the screen door and goes inside...
Benjamin comes inside...
Daisy's just behind him...
The front room is empty...
The house still...
BENJAMIN Hello...
BENJAMIN Queenie...
BENJAMIN we're back...
BENJAMIN He looks into the parlor...
BENJAMIN The piano...
BENJAMIN He goes down a hallway into the kitchen...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Queenie...?
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Mama?
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Nobody...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) He goes down the hall looking in Queenie's small room under the stairs...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Nobody's there...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) He moves back into the front room...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) calling...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Hello...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Anybody here?
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) When finally an old Woman, who's been sleeping, comes out of her bedroom...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) It's Benjamin, Mrs. Carter...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Where is everybody?
THE OLD WOMAN Benjamin...
THE OLD WOMAN your mother died.
The church crowded...
And we see Benjamin and Daisy coming in the back as the service is ending...
They are the only white people there.
Benjamin walks to the open casket...
standing by his mother's side as the choir sings a Hallelujah chorus...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We buried her beside her beloved Mr. Weathers...
A predominantly African-American cemetery...
overgrown and old...
The mourners, almost all of them old white people, standing at Queenie's gravesite alongside her beloved Mr. Weathers.
We see Queenie's daughter among the mourners...
in her early 30s herself now...
And Benjamin, standing over his mother's grave...
saying his goodbyes...
BENJAMIN We are meant to lose the people we love.
BENJAMIN It's how we know how important they are to us.
BENJAMIN'S (V.O.) And so we could have memories of our own I sold my Father's house on Blaine Street...
The old house, in a now decaying New Orleans neighborhood...
but despite the faltering area, the house retains a dignity of its own...
We see a young pregnant Woman, a renter, being shown by Benjamin along with a Real Estate Agent, around the old house.
THE WOMAN ...It's such a lovely place...
THE WOMAN You must have a lot of fond memories.
THE WOMAN It must be hard for you to give it up.
THE WOMAN Benjamin doesn't say anything.
THE WOMAN There's a knock on the door.
THE WOMAN Benjamin opens it, to let an OLDER MAN in...
THE WOMAN quite a bit older...
THE MAN Is Mrs. Williamson here yet...
THE MAN I'm sorry to be late...
THE MAN And he sees his wife...
THE MAN pleased to see her...
THE MAN hugging her...
THE MAN tenderly kissing her...
THE MAN and their age difference readily obvious...
THE MAN Benjamin acutely aware of it...
THE WOMAN It's a wonderful old place, darling...
THE WOMAN I think we will be so happy here...
THE WOMAN They go into the hallway lined with the family photographs...
THE WOMAN She's taken by them...
THE WOMAN (CONT'D) Oh, what a long family history you have...
BENJAMIN They come with the house...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) And we bought a house of our own...
Benjamin and Daisy sitting on the front steps of a suburban New Orleans townhouse, a small screened front porch with a tree in front...
DAISY I loved that house...
DAISY it smelled like firewood...
DAISY The chimney leaked smoke...
DAISY We didn't care...
DAISY Oh don't stop dear...
DAISY don't stop...
DAISY She closes her eyes...
CAROLINE'S VOICE (OVER) "It was one of the happiest times of my life..."
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We had no furniture to speak of...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) we would have picnics in the living room...
Benjamin and Daisy having a picnic on the virtually empty living room floor.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0,) We slept on a mattress...
We see Benjamin and Daisy sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the bedroom...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We vowed never to go to bed or wake up at the same time.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We lived on that mattress...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And we see just that, a short film of two people who can't get enough of each other living on a mattress...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Daisy and Benjamin at various times, while they are either sleeping, or talking, or eating, or reading, or making love, ON THE MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Our neighbor, Mrs. Van Dam was a physical therapist...
We see Daisy in the screened-in front porch, exercising her leg under the supervision of an older woman...
MRS.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) We lived four blocks from a public pool...
We see Daisy in a bathing suit, resting from swimming, holding on to the side of the pool, watching a young, well conditioned girl, 18, with nothing but her life ahead of her, completely in tune with her body, swimming laps...
And as it comes to all of us, painfully aware of the years passing, her own physical mortality, she starts to cry...
And we see that Benjamin, come to meet her, is standing above her.
BENJAMIN You're crying...
DAISY It's just the chlorine...
DAISY Looking at the young girl...
DAISY looking at her...
DAISY understanding...
BENJAMIN You chose something to do...
BENJAMIN something so special...
BENJAMIN so unique...
BENJAMIN there was such a short period of time that you could do it...
BENJAMIN Even if nothing had happened ...
BENJAMIN Sooner or later you would be in the same place you are now...
BENJAMIN She's quiet...
BENJAMIN she knows what he's saying is true...
DAISY I don't like getting old.
Benjamin, Daisy holding onto him, riding the old motorcycle along the lake...
Daisy sits in the familiar deck chair his father had sat in looking out at the lake...
Benjamin brings her a cup of coffee...
He sits on the deck on his heels beside her...
DAISY I promise you, I'll never lose myself to self-pity again...
DAISY And as they watch the day begin...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And I think, right there and then, she realized none of us is perfect forever.
The window has started to rattle again...
the wind knocking.
CAROLINE I thought the wind had shifted away...
Daisy doesn't say anything, lying still, staring off...
her breathing shallow, laboring...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Mother?
DAISY I don't remember if I turned the lights off.
DAISY Did I leave the heater on?
DAISY The Nurse, on her way by, seeing her distress...
DAISY coming in...
THE NURSE Let's get you comfortable...
THE NURSE She gently covers her...
THE NURSE Daisy quietly lies back...
THE NURSE (CONT'D) She's getting ready to leave...
THE NURSE (CONT'D) She looks at Caroline and turns and leaves the room.
THE NURSE (CONT'D) Caroline quietly looks at her mother.
THE NURSE (CONT'D) Their eyes meet.
DAISY You have the most beautiful eyes.
DAISY Caroline reaches to hold her thin hand.
DAISY Daisy says something to herself.
DAISY Caroline looks at her...she looks down at the book...
CAROLINE He said, "She found peace."
DAISY Peace.
A small dance studio...
a scratchy phonograph record playing music...
young girls learning how to dance...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She opened a dance studio...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And we see Daisy, in a long skirt over a long sleeved leotard...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) wearing slippers...
The first time we've seen her dressed like this in many a year...
happily teaching young girls how to dance...
We see Daisy alone...
cleaning up...
music playing on the record player...
and for a brief moment she stops, and dances...
the smallest, most tentative of steps...
she sees in the studio's mirrors Benjamin's been silently watching her...
BENJAMIN You're still beautiful to watch...
BENJAMIN She looks at herself in the dance mirror...
BENJAMIN just what happens...
DAISY Dancing is all about the line...
DAISY the line of your body...after awhile...
DAISY you lose the line...
DAISY and you can never get it back...
DAISY They look at each other in the mirror...
DAISY (CONT'D) I figured out if you were born in 1918...
DAISY (CONT'D) 49 years ago...
DAISY (CONT'D) I'm 43...
DAISY (CONT'D) we're almost the same age...
DAISY (CONT'D) In three years we'll meet in the middle...
DAISY (CONT'D) And what she doesn't say, what they both know, is she's going one way and he's going the other...Benjamin affectionately...
BENJAMIN We finally caught up to each other...
BENJAMIN She smiles, starts to turn...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Stay just like that...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I want to remember what we look like right now.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) They stay like that for a moment longer...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) She turns to get her things...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) She shuts off the lights...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) She takes his arm...
DAISY I thought I was far too old...
DAISY I'm pregnant...
DAISY He stops...
DAISY They look at each other, she smiles, nodding "yes," it's true.
DAISY And deeply moved he takes her in his arms...
DAISY grateful...touching her face...
DAISY holding her...
CAROLINE You were pregnant?
CAROLINE You never said anything, did you?
CAROLINE I mean, what happened to the child?
DAISY The child...
DAISY We're not sure what more she is about to say, her breathing rasps...
DAISY she's having some difficulty breathing...
CAROLINE They said if you needed oxygen...
DAISY I want to breathe on my own...
DAISY Please...(and) sit down, my darling...
DAISY Caroline respects her wishes...
DAISY (CONT'D) I'm pregnant.
DAISY (CONT'D) And Caroline wanting to know what happened herself...
CAROLINE "She flourished..."
DAISY Hmmm...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) "She was happier than I had ever seen her..."
Benjamin and Daisy riding a street car, talking...
DAISY I thought I heard the nurse slip, and say "he..."
DAISY As they ride Benjamin looks over watching a father sitting with his child...
DAISY Daisy notices his look...
Benjamin and Daisy sitting at the window at one of the booths...
Daisy with a hot Fudge sundae and a tuna sandwich...
Benjamin just some coffee...
They're quiet...
And Daisy says...
DAISY I know you're afraid.
BENJAMIN I'm not hiding it.
DAISY Okay.
DAISY What's your worst fear?
BENJAMIN What if it has...what if its like me?...
DAISY Then we'll love it all the more...
BENJAMIN I want to be father...
BENJAMIN not a little brother...
BENJAMIN I don't want to be picked up from elementary school by my kid...
BENJAMIN I don't want anyone babysitting me...
DAISY I'm going to make this work...
DAISY This is what I want, and I want it with you...
BENJAMIN You know, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you...
DAISY Would you tell a blind man he can't have children?
DAISY You will be a father for as long as you can.
DAISY I know the consequences.
DAISY I accepted that.
DAISY Your love, loving you, is worth everything to me.
DAISY For the fiftieth time today I've got to go pee...
He smiles...
She gets up and goes to the restroom.
He sits with his thoughts...
and he notices a television's on...
a news report...
something catches his eye...
someone swimming?
He gets up moving to the television...
where he hears...
A MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) The oldest woman to ever swim the English Channel arrived in Calais today...
A MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) having made the swim in thirty-four hours, twenty-two minutes and fourteen seconds...
A MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) the sixty-eight year old Englishwoman, Elizabeth Abbott...
A MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) And we see dear ELIZABETH ABBOTT, coming out of the water, completing the English Channel swim.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Anything's possible.
ELIZABETH ABBOTT And as she smiles, after a lifetime of waiting, triumphant...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT And Benjamin smiles for her, and for himself, too...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT where anything is possible...
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Daisy's come beside him...
DAISY Ready?
BENJAMIN Yes.
BENJAMIN He leaves some money.
BENJAMIN He takes her arm...
BENJAMIN and as they go outside, moving along the street...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) On a day like any other in the spring...
We see Benjamin in the bedroom, putting on a shirt...
getting dressed...
And there's the sound of something falling...
and then...
DAISY Benjamin...
DAISY And he runs out of the room...
DAISY to see Daisy, fallen, sitting on the stairs...
241   CONTINUED:                                                        241 a glass of milk spilled on the carpet...
and blood on her nightdress...
he runs to a phone...
BENJAMIN Get me an ambulance...
BENJAMIN My wife is seven months pregnant and fell on the stairs...
DAISY Benjamin...
DAISY the baby's coming...
DAISY And he hurries to her side...
DAISY and as she clasps his hand...
Paramedics are there...
tending to Daisy, Benjamin at her side, as she struggles.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She gave birth to a five pound four ounce baby girl...
We see, lying on Daisy's chest, is a newborn baby...
Benjamin, standing beside her...
And a young Woman Doctor that's there...
packing up her things...
BENJAMIN You're sure there's nothing wrong with her?
THE YOUNG WOMAN DOCTOR She's a normal, healthy baby in every way...
THE YOUNG WOMAN DOCTOR And Benjamin moved, kisses the baby's head...
THE YOUNG WOMAN DOCTOR as he looks at this precious child of his...
CAROLINE'S (V.O.) We named her Caroline, for my mother...
CAROLINE'S (V.O.) And as Benjamin holds Daisy's hand while she nurses her...
Caroline's stopped reading...
dead still...
CAROLINE He was my father...?
CAROLINE This Benjamin was my father?
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Why didn't you ever tell me...?!
DAISY It doesn't change for a moment who you are.
DAISY You were a gift.
DAISY Sometimes the gifts we are given are not free.
CAROLINE You never said a word to me...
CAROLINE Caroline, upset, gets up...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) I need to go for a minute...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) She leaves the room...
DAISY My dearest darling, we were both deprived of him...
DAISY Daisy lying still...
DAISY in her turban...
DAISY her blue eyes...
DAISY her breathing rasping...
Caroline stands in the hall.
The bustle of the hospital, the exigencies of life going on about her.
The Nurse, seeing her...
THE NURSE It can get to you...
THE NURSE And Caroline, unable to hold it in, can't stop bitter tears from running down her face...
THE NURSE The Nurse is called for...
THE NURSE She goes off down the hallway...
THE NURSE Caroline takes another moment and goes back into the hospital room...
Daisy, seeing her come back in...
DAISY I was worried you weren't coming back...
CAROLINE You're all I have.
DAISY Read the rest of it, darling.
Caroline hesitates, then sits back down, and quietly takes up the "book."
CAROLINE "You grew, like the doctor had said, normal and healthy..."
NIGHT, 1969 The room's dark.
NIGHT, 1969 We see Benjamin in bed, the baby sleeping between him and Daisy...
NIGHT, 1969 And as Benjamin watches them sleep...
NIGHT, 1969 he looks at his reflection in a wall mirror...
NIGHT, 1969 his 51st year on this earth...
NIGHT, 1969 34 years old...
NIGHT, 1969 a young man...
NIGHT, 1969 He looks at his baby...
NIGHT, 1969 he looks at Daisy...
NIGHT, 1969 in her mid 40s...
NIGHT, 1969 her hair's begun to gray...
NIGHT, 1969 her face begun to show the natural touches of age...
NIGHT, 1969 His stare awakens her...
NIGHT, 1969 She looks at him sensing he's deeply troubled...
NIGHT, 1969 He shuts his eyes...
NIGHT, 1969 she watches him sleep, Daisy as troubled as he is...
NIGHT, 1969 but for very different reasons...
Benjamin is sitting with Caroline while she plays in a park's sand box...
Caroline helping herself to a mouthful of sand...
Benjamin, trying to get the sand out of her mouth...
BENJAMIN Don't eat sand...
BENJAMIN Daisy comes over to sit with them...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) She's going to have a really attractive diaper.
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) As they sit watching Caroline playing in the sand...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I think you should find a real father for her...
DAISY What are you talking about?
BENJAMIN She needs someone to grow old with...
DAISY She'll learn to accept whatever happens...
DAISY She loves you...
BENJAMIN She needs a father not a playmate.
DAISY Is it that my age is starting to show...?
DAISY Is that what you are telling me?
DAISY Have you lost your desire for me...?
BENJAMIN You don't need another child to raise...
DAISY You're going to leave me, aren't you?
DAISY He doesn't say anything.
DAISY (CONT'D) You can't leave me.
DAISY (CONT'D) He's silent.
DAISY (CONT'D) You can't do this to me...!
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It was your first birthday.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We had a party...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) the house was filled with people...
The birthday party.
A cake with a big number "1" candle.
One-year-olds not having a clue.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) The fathers and mothers were there...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) He looks at the age appropriate mothers and fathers with their children...
A MAN Before you look around they'll be in High School dating.
A MAN Benjamin manages a smile.
DAISY I remember your first birthday like it was yesterday.
The house is empty, the guests gone...
Daisy busy cleaning up from the party.
She stops to look outside, at the backyard.
Benjamin is sitting on a lounge chair...
the baby, in her party dress, sitting on his chest...
As Daisy stands at the window watching him with their baby...
1969 Benjamin, dressed, watching Caroline in her crib, asleep.
1969 Daisy in bed, asleep.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I sold the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I sold my share of Button's Buttons...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I sold the sailboat...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I put it all into an account for your mother...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And before you would ever remember me...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And he bends to kiss his sleeping daughter, whispering to her...
BENJAMIN I want you to know I love you...
He stops to put a bank book on the dresser, along with a house key...
the sound of the key is just enough for Daisy to stir.
He starts to leave...
He turns to go...
and he sees Daisy is looking at him...
A look not so much of anger, or hurt, not of resignation, but a look of acceptance...
that this is what her life is now...
He crosses out of the dark room silently closing the door behind him...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I left, so that you and your mother could have a life.
He takes the old motorcycle out of the garage.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I left with just the clothes on my back.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) He starts the motorcycle, and with just the shirt on his back he rides away...
1969 Daisy still lying in bed, the sound of the motorcycle driving away.
1969 She gets up.
1969 She takes the baby out of her crib and into bed with her, holding her baby in the bare light...
Daisy, in her regal turban, silently looking out the window...
the wind knocking loudly again...
CAROLINE I almost wish I didn't know any of this.
CAROLINE I feel odd, reading...it...
CAROLINE She looks at the book...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Where did he go?
DAISY I don't know.
DAISY I never heard from him.
DAISY Caroline, distant, picks through the book...She comes upon...
CAROLINE There are postcards...
CAROLINE Looking through them...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) They're all addressed to me...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) They're from all sorts of places...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) And she realizes...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) They're for my birthday.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) 1970...I would have been two...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "Happy Birthday."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "I wish I could have kissed you goodnight."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "Happy Birthday, you're five."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "I wish I could have taken you to your first day of school."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "Happy Birthday six-year-old."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "I wish I could be there to teach you how to play the piano..."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "11..."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "...Told you not to chase some boy..."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "13..."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "Held you when you had a broken heart..."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "1983."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) I was fifteen.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "I wish I could have been your father.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Nothing I ever did will replace that..."
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Daisy murmurs...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Which brings Caroline back to the book...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) What I think is..."
And Benjamin's voice comes in...
WHILE WE SEE HIM IN
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "...What I think is, it's never too late...or, in my case, too early, to be whoever you want to be...There's no time limit, start anytime you want...change or stay the same...there aren't any rules...We can make the best or worst of it...I hope you make the best...I hope you see things that startle you.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Feel things you never felt before.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I hope you meet people who have a different point of view.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I hope you challenge yourself.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I hope you stumble, and pick yourself up.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I hope you live the life you wanted to...and if you haven't, I hope you start all over again."
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) When we come out of those images...
Caroline finishes reading...
CAROLINE "...
CAROLINE I hope you start all over again..."
CAROLINE It's quiet...just the wind knocking...She looks at her mother...but Daisy's staring, somewhere else...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) (takes up reading again...)
CAROLINE (CONT'D) I'd been gone for a long time...
DAISY He'd been gone for a long time...
DAISY To the Dance Studio...
A record's playing piano music.
Classes are done.
Parents taking their children.
We see Daisy, in her long skirt...
helping pick up with her hands and her nimble toes, errant clothing, the jackets, the sweaters...
It takes us a moment to recognize her...
in the some twelve years since we've last seen her, 56 now, her hair's cut short...
and it's gone mostly gray...
and, although her age is on her face, she still has a dancer's posture, her head held high...
carrying herself with grace...
and one thing that will never change, are her unforgettable blue eyes...
We hear the door opening...
Daisy, busy gathering, saying her goodnights...
glances toward the door across the studio...
And she sees a young Man has come in, a young man in his twenties...
standing silently, a stranger, standing by the door...
Daisy, as she closes up the studio, makes her way toward him, saying goodnight to people...
she bends to pick up a ballet slipper...
DAISY Somebody left their slipper...
DAISY Daisy looks over, the young Man hasn't moved...
DAISY the studio has all but emptied...
DAISY she walks toward him...
DAISY he's wearing worn trousers, a coat that's seen better days...
DAISY (CONT'D) Are you here to pick someone up?
DAISY (CONT'D) He shakes "no."
DAISY (CONT'D) Coming closer....
DAISY (CONT'D) I'm sorry, we're closed now.
DAISY (CONT'D) She moves to open the door to show him out...
DAISY (CONT'D) when she gets a good look at him.
DAISY (CONT'D) She stops, realizing who it is...
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin?
DAISY (CONT'D) ...and she's taken aback by his youth, we all are...
DAISY (CONT'D) sixteen years younger...
DAISY (CONT'D) in his 20s now...
DAISY (CONT'D) it's at once staggering and heartbreaking...
DAISY (CONT'D) what age can do...
DAISY (CONT'D) And she realizes, at that very moment, he was right all along...
DAISY (CONT'D) You're so young.
DAISY (CONT'D) They look at each other...
DAISY (CONT'D) When she's able to find the words...
DAISY (CONT'D) Why did you come back?
BENJAMIN I wanted to see you both.
BENJAMIN She stares at him...
BENJAMIN just the piano music.
BENJAMIN And despite the gulf of time...
BENJAMIN there's a terrible aching they have for each other...
BENJAMIN and before they can say anything...
BENJAMIN the door swings open and Caroline, 12, comes hurrying in...
CAROLINE You ready, Mom?
CAROLINE Benjamin stares at her appearance...
CAROLINE And Daisy, can't help herself, and seeing Caroline, Daisy, overcome by it all, starts to cry.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Is something wrong, Mother?
DAISY No...
DAISY He was telling me a very sad story about a mutual friend we hadn't seen in a long time...
DAISY This is my friend, Benjamin...
DAISY you knew him when you were...
DAISY just a baby...
CAROLINE Hi...
BENJAMIN Hello...
BENJAMIN He reaches, taking her hand...
BENJAMIN needing to touch her...
A MAN'S (V.O.) Hello...
A MAN'S (V.O.) And a Man 50s, wearing a suit and a tie, comes in...
THE MAN I'm sorry...
THE MAN I thought you were done...
DAISY This is a friend of my family's...
DAISY Benjamin Button...
DAISY this is my husband...
DAISY Robert...
DAISY They shake hands...
DAISY There's an awkward quiet...
ROBERT It was nice to have met you...
ROBERT We'll be in the car, darling...
DAISY I'm just closing up...
DAISY And Robert and Caroline go outside to wait for her...
BENJAMIN She's so lovely...
BENJAMIN she looks like you...
BENJAMIN Does she dance?
DAISY Not very well.
BENJAMIN I suppose that would be from my side of things.
`DAISY She's a dear sweet girl...
`DAISY she seems a little lost...
`DAISY But who isn't a little lost at 12?
`DAISY There's a lot of her that reminds me of you.
`DAISY And she shuts off a set of the lights.
DAISY (CONT'D) My husband.
DAISY (CONT'D) He's a doctor...
DAISY (CONT'D) was a widower...
DAISY (CONT'D) He's an incredibly bright, adventurous man...
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin smiles.
DAISY (CONT'D) He's been a terrific father...
DAISY (CONT'D) and a great partner and friend...
DAISY (CONT'D) And she shuts off the record player and another set of lights...
DAISY (CONT'D) and for a moment they stand in the dark studio...
DAISY (CONT'D) and they look at their reflections in the mirror...
DAISY (CONT'D) seeing who they are now...
DAISY (CONT'D) You're so much younger.
BENJAMIN Just what you can see.
BENJAMIN She looks at him, and after all these years...
BENJAMIN she now understands completely...
BENJAMIN she looks outside at her daughter standing by the car with her "father," waiting...
DAISY You ware right.
DAISY She needed a father.
DAISY I couldn't have raised both of you.
DAISY I'm not that strong.
DAISY He's quiet.
DAISY They both are.
DAISY She looks at him.
DAISY (CONT'D) I never thought how it must have broken your heart, too.
DAISY (CONT'D) His silence is enough.
DAISY (CONT'D) Where are you staying?
DAISY (CONT'D) What are you going to do?
BENJAMIN I'm at the Pontchartrain Hotel on the avenue.
BENJAMIN I have no idea what I'm going to do.
BENJAMIN And it seems like they want to hold each other.
BENJAMIN But they can't.
BENJAMIN It's still.
BENJAMIN And aware of the car's headlights waiting at the curb...
BENJAMIN she turns, holding the door open for him...
DAISY I have to go.
DAISY He nods.
DAISY He walks by her, going out.
She stops to lock the door.
She turns, getting into the car...
and leaves...
Benjamin stands on the corner, hands in his pockets, the car driving by him...
and Daisy can't help but look at him...
and then the car's gone...
and as he crosses the street and walks off into the night...
CAROLINE That young man was my father?
CAROLINE And a Nurse comes in.
THE NURSE The hurricane changed directions again.
THE NURSE They are predicting it will make landfall sometime soon.
CAROLINE Is there anything we need to do?
THE NURSE Arrangements are being made to move people if we have to.
THE NURSE I'll let you know as soon as we know anything.
THE NURSE She leaves hurriedly.
DAISY Please tell me what he says?
DAISY Caroline looks at the book.
DAISY And Benjamin's voice comes in...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "That night..."
Benjamin, sitting on the end of the bed, not sure why he came there at all...
There's a sound at the door...as if somebody was there...
BENJAMIN Hello?
BENJAMIN Its quiet...a hesitancy...He starts to get up and there's a knock on the door...He opens it...and Daisy's there.
BENJAMIN He's startled to see her...
DAISY May I come in?
BENJAMIN Please...
BENJAMIN She comes inside...an awkward quiet...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I don't know what I'm doing here...What I expected...?
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) It echoes how she's feeling being there...They stand not knowing what to say...And Daisy says, sadly...
DAISY Nothing lasts.
DAISY He puts a finger to her lips.
DAISY He shakes "no."
DAISY And what he's come to know, that some things do last...
BENJAMIN I never once stopped loving you...
BENJAMIN He affectionately pushes a hair off of her forehead...
DAISY I'm an old woman now, Benjamin.
DAISY And he helps her off with her coat...
DAISY She's still.
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin...
DAISY (CONT'D) He kisses her...
DAISY (CONT'D) and she's quiet...
DAISY (CONT'D) and he undresses her...
DAISY (CONT'D) undressing himself...
DAISY (CONT'D) and they stand momentarily naked...
DAISY (CONT'D) the young man and the older woman.
DAISY (CONT'D) Are you sure?
BENJAMIN Some things you don't ever forget...
BENJAMIN the feel...
BENJAMIN the taste...
BENJAMIN And he kisses her again...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) ...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) the smell...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) He puts his mouth by her cheek...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) breathing her in...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) ...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) the touch...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Caressing her...
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Of someone you love...
We see Benjamin standing at the window watching as Daisy gets into a taxi...
the taxi starting to drive off...
and Daisy turning...
to look back...
waving to him.
Benjamin waving to her...
what they both somehow know, is a last goodbye...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I watched her go...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) ..and as the taxi drives away...
(CONT'D) Until she went out of sight...
(CONT'D) ...the taxi going down the street and out of sight...
(CONT'D) for the last time...
(CONT'D) Despite losing sight of her he still hasn't moved...
(CONT'D) standing by the window...
Daisy, breath raspy, sitting silently in her bed looking out the window...
We realize Caroline's stopped reading...
DAISY Please read...
CAROLINE That's the last thing he wrote...
CAROLINE Daisy's quiet...
CAROLINE they both are...
CAROLINE alone with their thoughts...
CAROLINE (CONT'D) What happened to him after that last time with you, Mother?
CAROLINE (CONT'D) The wind has picked up considerably, rattling the window even harder..
DAISY A year or so after your father passed...
DAISY There was a call...
And we see Daisy in her bathrobe, in her sixties...
drinking a cup of coffee...
the telephone rings...
DAISY Hello?...
DAISY Yes?...
DAISY Speaking -- I don't understand?
DAISY Where was that?
We see Daisy riding in the back or a taxi.
DAISY It's the last house...
DAISY She looks outside, and we see up ahead of her, the Nolan House standing like a monument to time...
Daisy gets out.
The taxi drives off.
Daisy stops for a moment before she opens the gate.
The house has fallen into disrepair.
A solitary old man sits on the porch rocking and rocking.
She goes up the walk and out of habit goes around the back porch...
to the kitchen...
going inside...
She comes into the kitchen.
She moves down the hallway into the living room...
The interior has also fallen on hard times.
Some old people are still in residence -- predominantly African Americans now...
Queenie's daughter, now in her fifties herself, stands in the living room...
Along with a plain Man in a plain suit...
DAISY I'm Daisy...
DAISY The Man turns...
THE MAN Thank you for coming...
THE MAN I'm David Hernandez with the Orleans Parish department of Child Welfare Services.
THE MAN Queenie's daughter turns on a lamp...
THE MAN it doesn't work...
THE MAN she crosses the room to turn on another...
THE MAN (CONT'D) He was found living in a condemned building off of east Lamont...
THE MAN (CONT'D) the police found this with him...
THE MAN (CONT'D) this address...
THE MAN (CONT'D) and your name...
THE MAN (CONT'D) And he gives her the journal...
THE MAN (CONT'D) He was in very poor health...
THE MAN (CONT'D) he was taken to the hospital...
THE MAN (CONT'D) He doesn't seem to know who or where he is...
THE MAN (CONT'D) He's very confused...
THE MAN (CONT'D) The doctors who looked at him think he may be autistic.
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER I told Mr. Hernandez about Benjamin bein' one of us.
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER I told him if he needs a place to stay...
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER it's alright...
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER he can stay here...
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER he is blood after all...
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER And just then we hear a PIANO playing...
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER as if it were being played by a child...
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER with no skill...
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER banging as much as anything...
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER And Daisy follows the sound of the piano into the parlor...
And she sees his back...
just a boy of 12 now...
hunched over...
trying to play the piano...
trying to play the tune the woman had taught to him...
DAISY Benjamin.
DAISY He turns at the sound of her voice.
DAISY There is no indication he recognizes her at all.
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE Do you know this song?
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE And he tries to play what he thinks is the song, but is nothing more than a child playing random notes.
DAISY You play really beautifully.
DAISY She comes and touches his back...
DAISY He shrinks from her touch.
THE MAN He doesn't seem to like to be touched.
THE MAN And while he tries to play...
THE MAN (CONT'D) The doctors said if they didn't know any better, he goes in and out of states of recognition, as if he had the beginnings of dementia...
THE MAN (CONT'D) Daisy's looking at the boy, who was once the man she loved...
THE MAN (CONT'D) who she still loves...
THE MAN (CONT'D) She looks into his eyes...
DAISY Do you remember me?
DAISY I'm Daisy.
DAISY He looks at her.
DAISY No sense of recognition.
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE Daisy is a very pretty name.
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE I'm Benjamin.
DAISY It's good to meet you Benjamin.
DAISY Do you mind if I sit with you?
DAISY I would love to hear you play.
DAISY He doesn't say anything.
DAISY She sits down beside him on the piano bench.
DAISY He stops to look at her.
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE There's something about you...
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE There's something about your eyes I remember from a long time ago...
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE He looks at her eyes.
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE She looks at him...
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE And as she sits with him on the piano bench...
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE as he tries to play...
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE Daisy and Benjamin, "together again..."
DAISY Queenie's daughter saw to it that he was taken care of...
And we see Benjamin, just eight now...
coming into the kitchen...
Queenie's daughter cleaning up after breakfast.
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT I want some breakfast.
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER You just ate breakfast.
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT No I didn't...
AN OLD WOMAN You just finished eating, Mr.
AN OLD WOMAN Button.
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT You think I don't know what you are doing?
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT And like an eight year old, or an old man old with onset Alzheimer's -- which makes him nearly a helpless child, he starts to rage...
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT throwing things...
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT (CONT'D) You are all fucking liars!
DAISY'S (V.0.) And every day I would stop by...
DAISY'S (V.0.) and make sure he was comfortable...
DAISY'S (V.0.) And just then Daisy comes into the kitchen.
DAISY'S (V.0.) She sees him raging.
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER He doesn't believe he's already had his breakfast.
DAISY Let's see if we can find something else for you to do.
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT I can't help it.
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT I can't help this.
DAISY I know you can't.
DAISY And as she puts her arm around him, taking him out of the room, understanding...
DAISY'S (V.0.) Many times he would simply forget who and where he was at all...
We see Daisy sitting on a bed with Benjamin in his room on the second floor of the old house...
And he's oddly lucid...more articulate than his age would indicate...
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT I get the feeling there's a lot of things I can't remember...
DAISY What do you mean?
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT It's like there's this whole life I had and I can't remember what it was...
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT He's frustrated by it...
DAISY It's alright...
DAISY It's alright to forget things...
DAISY And as she sits on his bed with him...
DAISY in the upstairs room...
DAISY'S (V.0.) It wasn't easy...
And we see Benjamin, no more than six now, standing on the ROOF...
Daisy standing on the ground down below him...
DAISY I wish you'd come down...
BENJAMIN AT SIX I can see everything.
BENJAMIN AT SIX And he points out...
BENJAMIN AT SIX (CONT'D) I can see the big river...
BENJAMIN AT SIX (CONT'D) all the boats...
BENJAMIN AT SIX (CONT'D) I can see the graveyard where mama's buried and all those other people...
BENJAMIN AT SIX (CONT'D) I can see the city...
BENJAMIN AT SIX (CONT'D) where you have your dancing place...
And tears fill Daisy's eyes...
DAISY You're right, you can see everything sweetheart...
DAISY And he can...
DAISY he can see all the way across to the Mississippi River...
DAISY the old graveyard...
DAISY the city...
DAISY his whole life...
DAISY (CONT'D) I think you better come down...
BENJAMIN AT SIX What if I could fly?
BENJAMIN AT SIX And it looks like he might just try...
DAISY I knew a man who could fly.
DAISY Come down and I'll tell you all about him.
DAISY He's quiet, thinking about that.
DAISY And acquiescing, he turns up the roof out of sight...
DAISY some short moments...and he comes running out the front door...
DAISY his hands in his pockets like the brave little man he is...
DAISY Daisy bends down...
DAISY and as he runs into her arms...
DAISY Daisy holding him...
Daisy propped in her bed looking out the window...
DAISY And I went to take care of him...
And we see Daisy, in her seventies now, carrying a suitcase, coming up the walkway, and onto the porch...
old people sitting in the porch chairs...
DAISY'S (V.0.) He was five, I think, when I moved in...
DAISY'S (V.0.) the same age I was when I had met him...
DAISY'S (V.0.) And we see Benjamin, 5 now, sitting on the porch swing, staring off...
DAISY'S (V.0.) and he drools like a helpless old man.
DAISY'S (V.0.) Daisy stops, taking out a handkerchief, wiping the drool off his chin...
DAISY How would you like to help me unpack?
Daisy, unpacking her suitcase with Benjamin's help, taking out an alarm clock, a quilt, some photographs...
The "Just So Book.."
Her personal things...
moving in...
Benjamin, playing with the alarm clock, making the alarm go off...
again, and again...
Benjamin in a small child's bed.
Daisy, sitting on his bed reading from Kipling's "Just So" stories to him...
DAISY This is the picture of old Man Kangaroo at five in the afternoon, when he got his beautiful hind legs just as Big God Ngong had promised.
DAISY'S (V.0.) The days passed...
And we see Benjamin, just three or so now, holding Daisy's hand, walking with her in some autumn leaves...
DAISY'S (V.0.) I watched as he forgot how to talk...
Benjamin almost two...
sitting On Daisy's lap in the front room...
and saying...
BENJAMIN AT ONE Benjamin...
BENJAMIN AT ONE Daisy...
DAISY That's right...
DAISY Benjamin and Daisy...
DAISY Proud of himself he smiles...
DAISY'S (V.0,) ...How to walk...
And we see him, just like a toddler, barely able to stand...
Daisy there to catch him from falling...
DAISY'S (V.0.) I watched him sleep...
Daisy, sitting on the porch on a rocking chair.
Benjamin, just a baby now, some months old, sleeping in her lap...
DAISY'S (V.0,) In 2002, they put a new clock on the train station wall...
And we see a workman on a ladder taking down the old clock of "Mr.
Cake's"...
handing it down to another workman...and putting up a new clock...
a digital clock...
The time moving...
the way it's meant to be...
going forward...
Daisy in her hospital bed...
the wind howling at the window...
DAISY In the spring of 2003...
Shadows dapple the room.
Daisy sitting in an old chair in the middle of the room...
with daylight streaming in on her...
holding Benjamin on her lap...
a tiny thing now...
nearly newborn...
he can almost fit in her two old hands...
DAISY'S (V.0.) He looked at me...
DAISY'S (V.0.) And we see him looking up at her...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) He looked into my eyes...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) And we see him looking into her eyes...
(CONT'D) And he moved his fingers...
(CONT'D) and with his little thumb he held my thumb...
(CONT'D) ...and that's just what he does...
(CONT'D) looking into Daisy's eyes...holding her thumb with his tiny hand...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) And as he had said...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) no matter what age he was...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) he was the same person behind his eyes...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) and, at that moment I knew...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) he knew who I was...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) The baby staring into her blue eyes...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) And then he closed his eyes like he was sleeping...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) And we see his eyes flutter and softly close...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) forever.
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) And as he lays in his beloved Daisy's lap...
DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) completely still...
The wind a full out hurricane.
The lights flicker.
Stay on.
CAROLINE I'm going to see what they want us to do...
CAROLINE And as she gets up, the "book" drops on the floor.
CAROLINE And a card's fallen out.
CAROLINE Caroline picks it up.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) It's a train schedule.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) She turns it over.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) There's writing.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "I'm on a train in India filled with people."
An overcrowded train car...
people sitting and standing and lying on the seats and on the floor, in every available space, nook and cranny, asleep.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I'm the only one who isn't sleeping...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) Now we see Benjamin sitting on the floor among all of the people, the only one awake, writing on the back of the train schedule.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) "I figured out one thing.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) If you're growing older or getting younger it really doesn't make any difference.
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) Whichever way you're going you have to make the most of what this is."
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) He looks at all the people sleeping around him...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) strangers on a train...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) "Along the way you bump into people who make a dent on your life...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) Some people...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) get struck by lightning..."
And we see just that...
Mr. DAWS being struck by lightning again...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "Some are born to sit by a river."
...And we see just that...
Mr. Oti sitting by his river...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "Some have an ear for music..."
And we see the unnamed older woman playing the piano...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "Some are artists..."
...And we see Captain Mike...
with his tattoos -- standing on his tug...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "Some swim the English Channel..."
...And we see Elizabeth Abbott doing just that...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "Some know buttons..."
...We see Thomas Button holding a button in the palm of his hand...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "Some know Shakespeare..."
...Tizzy reciting Shakespeare...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "Some are mothers...
...Queenie pointing at him...
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "And some people can dance..."
...And we see Daisy dancing...
forever young...
CAROLINE He started to write something else...
CAROLINE "I'm going..."
CAROLINE But he stopped...
CAROLINE She gently puts the card back.
CAROLINE (CONT'D) I wish I had known him.
DAISY Now you do.
DAISY They're still.
DAISY And the wind reminds her...
CAROLINE I'd better go and see what they're planning to do...
CAROLINE Daisy nods.
CAROLINE Caroline goes out of the room...
CAROLINE It's quiet.
CAROLINE Daisy's alone now...
CAROLINE looking out the window...
CAROLINE at the howling, hurricane...
CAROLINE a hundred mile an hour fury...
CAROLINE And fighting against the wind, trying to reach the window is a hummingbird...
CAROLINE it almost makes it and is pushed back by the gale...
CAROLINE but undaunted, its wings doing a figure eight...
CAROLINE the symbol for infinity...
CAROLINE it fights its way through the wind to the window...
CAROLINE tapping at the window...
CAROLINE and the hummingbird flies away...
CAROLINE she watches it go...
CAROLINE and after some moments she says...
DAISY Goodnight, Benjamin...
DAISY And she closes her eyes for the very last time...
DAISY and it's dark...
DAISY where it's peaceful, even safe...
We see the new clock high on the terminal wall running the right way...
going forward...
and as the clock turns...
people hurrying to their destinations, living their lives...
A storage room.
Old track signs.
Old waiting room chairs.
The discarded, and forgotten.
And lying on its side under an old tarpaulin -- is "Mr.
Cake's" clock...
the angel still pushing the hands...
running backwards...
forever...
