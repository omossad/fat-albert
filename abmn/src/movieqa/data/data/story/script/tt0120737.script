GALADRIEL (V.O.) A Hobbit....Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.
BILBO A Ring.
SUDDENLY!
A VOICE SCREAMS...ITS ANGUISH RINGING through the
GOLLUM (V.O.) Lost!
GOLLUM (V.O.) Lost!
GOLLUM (V.O.) My Precious is lost!!
Frightened Bilbo quickly POCKETS the ONE RING and hurries on.
GALADRIEL (V.O.) For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.
ANGLE ON: TWO HOBBIT FEET resting on a small rock...rising out of the LONG, OVERGROWN
SHIRE....60 YEARS LATER CAMERA TRACKS TO: a Figure lies beneath the dappled sunlight of an old tree.
White flowers are scattered among the Well seeded grasses.
An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer...
the figure is reading a book.
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance, growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..."
SUDDENLY!
The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes.
This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight with EXCITEMENT!
Tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth, Frodo runs off.
The cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped figure in Grey.
The shambling OLD PONY snorts and rears as...
SUDDENLY FRODO appears on a bank above the cart.
FRODO You're late.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...
GANDALF A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins, nor is he early.
GANDALF He arrives precisely when he means to.
They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front seat of the cart.
FRODO It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3 foot 6 inches tall.
GANDALF You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
Wide on: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended by
FRODO What news of the outside world?
FRODO Tell me everything!
Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.
GANDALF What, everything?
GANDALF Far too eager and curious for a Hobbit.
GANDALF Most unnatural...
Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy Hobbit Marketplace.
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D) Well, what can I tell you?
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D) Life in the wide world goes on much as if it has past age.
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D) Full of its own comings and goings, scarcely even aware of the existence of Hobbits...
Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before him.
GANDALF (CONT'D) ...for which I am very thankful.
Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon Inn...towards...
Wide on: The party field.
Where scOrcs of Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Ah, the long expected party.
GANDALF (CONT'D) So, how is the old rascal?
GANDALF (CONT'D) I hear it's going to be a Party of Special Magnificence.
FRODO You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place in an uproar.
GANDALF Oh, well...that should please him.
FRODO Half the Shire's been invited...
GANDALF Good gracious, me.
FRODO He's up to something.
GANDALF Oh, really?
Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.
FRODO Alright then..keep your secrets.
FRODO Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of.
GANDALF Indeed?
FRODO Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
GANDALF If you're referring to the incident with the Dragon...I was barely involved...all I did was give your Uncle a little nudge out the door.
FRODO Whatever you did...you've been officially labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.
GANDALF Oh, really?
ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply suspicious.
As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills and large trees.
The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.
Excited children, chasing after the cart.
Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries.
The children stand deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane.
At that moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.
Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke.
ODO PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle.
Frodo stands up in the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.
FRODO Gandalf...
FRODO I'm glad you're back.
FRODO Frodo leaps expertly from the cart.
FRODO Gandalf smiles.
GANDALF So am I, dear boy...so am I
Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a large round front door set into a grassy hillside.
There is a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS."
Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag End.
He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a voice calls out:
BILBO No, thank you!
BILBO We don't want any more visitors, well wishers, or distant relations.
GANDALF And what about very old friends?
Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him.
He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous Twinkle in his eye.
Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.
BILBO Gandalf?
GANDALF Bilbo Baggins!
BILBO My dear Gandalf!
Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.
GANDALF It's good to see you.
GANDALF One hundred and eleven years old, who would believe it!
Gandalf looks at him more keenly.
GANDALF (CONT'D) You haven't aged a day!
GANDALF (CONT'D) Gandalf and Bilbo laugh together and enter Bag End.
BILBO Come on, come in!
BILBO Welcome, welcome!!
Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with souvenirs of Bilbo's travels.
Gandalf has to stoop to avoid hitting his head on the low ceiling.
Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.
BILBO Tea?
BILBO Or maybe something stronger...
BILBO I've a few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296...a very good year, almost as old as I am.
BILBO It was laid down by my father.
BILBO What say we open one, eh?
Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam.
He groans.
BILBO (CONT'D) I was expecting you some time last week.
BILBO (CONT'D) Not that it matters, you come and go as you please, always have done, always will.
BILBO (CONT'D) You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no, that might be a little risky...
Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf smiles to himself.
BILBO (CONT'D) Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple tart...got some custard somewhere.
BILBO (CONT'D) Not much for Afters, I'm afraid.
BILBO (CONT'D) Oh no...we're alright...I've just found some sponge cake.
BILBO (CONT'D) Nice little snack.
BILBO (CONT'D) Hope it's enough.
BILBO (CONT'D) I could do you some eggs if you like?
Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf mysteriously appears behind him.
GANDALF Just tea, thank you.
BILBO Oh..right.
BILBO You don't mind if...?
GANDALF No, not at all.
GANDALF Go ahead.
GANDALF A sudden loud knock on the front door.
Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.
BILBO I'm not home.
Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.
BILBO (CONT'D) I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace.
BILBO (CONT'D) I want to see mountains again...mountains, Gandalf...
BILBO (CONT'D) and then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book...Oh, Tea!
GANDALF So, you mean to go through with your plan, then?
BILBO Yes, yes...it's all inhand.
BILBO All the arrangements are made.
GANDALF Frodo suspects something.
BILBO 'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not some block headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle!
GANDALF You will tell him, won't you?
BILBO Yes, yes.
GANDALF He's very fond of you.
BILBO I know.
BILBO He'd probably come with me if I asked him.
BILBO I think, in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods and the fields...
BILBO little rivers.
BILBO Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen window.
BILBO (CONT'D) I am old, Gandalf...
BILBO (CONT'D) Bilbo looks at Gandalf sadly...
BILBO (CONT'D) I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart.
Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping a small, unseen object.
BILBO (CONT'D) I feel thin...sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.
BILBO (CONT'D) I need a holiday...a very long holiday and I don't expect I shall return...in fact, I mean not to.
Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch.
Below them, final preparations are being made on the Party field.
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.
BILBO Old Toby, the finest weed in Southfarthing!
Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the air.
A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.
BILBO (CONT'D) Ohhhh,
BILBO (CONT'D) Gandalf my old friend...this will be a night to remember!
BOOM!
A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches.
TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff...
Bilbo is greeting visitors.
Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit, Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.
FRODO Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.
SAM I think I'll just have myself another ale.
FRODO Oh, no you don't.
FRODO Go on.
Sam goes to drain his glass...
suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers.
ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE as he is Swept away.
Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.
Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.
Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a group of young hobbit children.
BILBO So, there I was...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of a troll?
BILBO Do you know what a Troll is?
BILBO Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly things..and they're arguing...arguing about how they were going to cook us!
ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.
BILBO Whether it be turned on a spit or minced in a pie or whether they were going to sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly!
BILBO But they spent so long arguing the whether-to's and why-for's that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees...and turned them all to stone!
STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing feat!
Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young Hobbits in their late teens.
Pippin scrambles on to the back of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework
MERRY No, no..the big one...the big one!
MERRY Pippin grabs a huge rocket.
MERRY CLOSE ON: FIREWORK FUSE crackles with flame!
Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.
MERRY (CONT'D) You're supposed to stick it in the ground!
PIPPIN It is in the ground.
Merry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin!
The fuse sizzles angrily.
MERRY Outside!
PIPPIN It was your idea.
Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.
WHOOSH!
The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening power.
The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon!
Fire gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low towards the startled crowd.
Close on: Frodo watches the Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the Panicking crowd and impending danger!
FRODO Bilbo!
FRODO Watch out for the dragon!!
BILBO Dragon?
BILBO Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years!
As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express train!
Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents collapse, food flies everywhere.
The fireworks dragon turns a somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night.
ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN, clothes and hair smoking.
MERRY That was good!
PIPPIN Let's get another one!
LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears.
Low angle: Gandalf looking DOWN STERNLY!
GANDALF Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took...I might have known!
Are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy water...with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and sipping an ale.
Cries of "SPEECH!
SPEECH" erupt from the party.
Bilbo stepping on a stool...he bows in gratitude at the applause.
FRODO Speech!
BILBO My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and Brandybucks...Grubbs, Chubbs, Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and Proudfoots...
ODO PROUDFOOT Proudfeet!
BILBO Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday.
BILBO Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits!
BILBO Tremendous outburst of approval!
BILBO (CONT'D) I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you as well as well as you deserve.
SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was a compliment or not.
CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to themselves.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his head.
A bead of sweat rolls down his brow.
Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and holds it behind his back.
BILBO (CONT'D) I have..things to do and I have put this off for far too long...
BILBO (CONT'D) CLOSE ON: BILBO'S knuckles turn white as he tightens his grip on the small object behind his back.
BILBO (CONT'D) I regret to announce, this is the end.
BILBO (CONT'D) I am going now.
BILBO (CONT'D) I bid you all a very fond farewell!!
BILBO (CONT'D) Bilbo looks across at Frodo, hesitates...
BILBO (CONT'D) then...
BILBO (CONT'D) Goodbye.
Bilbo instantly vanishes.
The party explodes into an uproar...
the crowd leaps to its feet.
ANGLE ON: FRODO staring at the empty stool in disbelief.
The party is still in an excited uproar...
some 50 yards away as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End.
Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.
The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a plain gold ring off his finger.
Bilbo laughs as he tosses the ring in the air, then places it in his pocket.
Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick.
He finds Gandalf looming over him.
GANDALF I suppose you think that was terribly clever?
BILBO Come on, Gandalf!
BILBO Did you see their faces?
GANDALF There are many magic rings in the world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be used lightly.
BILBO It was just a bit of fun.
BILBO Oh, you're probably right as usual.
GANDALF You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
BILBO I'm leaving everything to him.
GANDALF What about this ring of yours?
GANDALF Is that staying too?
Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece.
BILBO Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over there on the mantelpiece.
BILBO Gandalf frowns at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise.
BILBO (CONT'D) No, wait.
BILBO (CONT'D) It's here in my pocket.
BILBO (CONT'D) Isn't that...isn't' that odd now?
BILBO (CONT'D) Yet, after all, why not?
BILBO (CONT'D) Why shouldn't I keep it?
GANDALF I think you should leave the Ring behind, Bilbo.
GANDALF Is that so hard?
BILBO Well, no...and yes.
BILBO Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it.
BILBO It's mine.
BILBO I found it.
BILBO It came to me!
GANDALF There's no need to get angry.
BILBO Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!
BILBO It's mine.
BILBO My own, my precious.
GANDALF Precious?
GANDALF It's been called that before, but not by you.
BILBO So?
BILBO What business is it of yours what I do with my own things?
BILBO Bilbo's voice, shape and manner have suddenly changed.
GANDALF I think you've had that ring quite long enough.
BILBO You want it for yourself!
Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room
GANDALF Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks!
GANDALF Bilbo cowers from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a frightened Hobbit.
GANDALF Gandalf's expression softens.
GANDALF (CONT'D) I am not trying to rob you.
GANDALF (CONT'D) I am trying to help you.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Sobbing, Bilbo runs to Gandalf and hugs him.
GANDALF (CONT'D) All you long years we've been friends...trust me as you once did.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Let it go!
BILBO You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go to Frodo.
Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.
BILBO (CONT'D) It's late, the road is long...
BILBO (CONT'D) yes, it is time.
GANDALF Bilbo?
BILBO Hmmm?
GANDALF The ring is still in your pocket.
Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.
BILBO Oh, yes.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his palm.
With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor.
CLOSE ON: The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.
Bilbo staggering out of Bag end...he braces himself in the night air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring has weakened him.
Gandalf steps up behind.
BILBO I've thought up and ending for my book..."
BILBO And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days."
GANDALF I'm sure you will, my dear friend.
BILBO Goodbye, Gandalf.
GANDALF Goodbye Bilbo.
Bilbo walks away from Bag End, disappearing into the night, softly singing: "The Road goes on and on."
GANDALF (CONT'D) Until our next meeting.
CLOSE ON: THE RING...Glinting on the floor...Gandalf circles around it, a Puzzled look on his face.
Gandalf slowly reaches for the ring.
His fingers barely touch the ring...the creepy Hum rises on the soundtrack.
Gandalf is sitting in front of the fire, with his pipe...staring into the flickering flames.
BILBO (V.O.) It's mine, my own, my precious.
GANDALF Riddles in the dark.
FRODO Bilbo!
FRODO Bilbo!
Frodo rushes into Bag End...he stops and picks up the ring at his feet.
Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if locked in thought.
GANDALF My precious...precious..
FRODO He's gone, hasn't he?
FRODO Frodo steps into the living room.
FRODO (CONT'D) He talked for so long about leaving...I didn't think he'd really do it.
GANDALF ...my own.
FRODO Gandalf?
Gandalf turns...his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's fingers.
GANDALF Bilbo's ring.
Gandalf sorts hurriedly through Bilbo's papers...
GANDALF (CONT'D) He's gone to stay with the Elves.
GANDALF (CONT'D) He's left you Bag End...
Gandalf holds out the envelope...Frodo drops the ring into it.
GANDALF (CONT'D) ...along with all his possessions.
Gandolf seals the envelope with wax.
He hands it to Frodo.
GANDALF (CONT'D) The ring is yours now.
GANDALF (CONT'D) But it somewhere out of sight.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Gandalf rises hurriedly and starts to gather his things.
FRODO Where are you going?
GANDALF I have some things I must see to.
FRODO What things?
GANDALF Questions.
GANDALF Questions that need answering.
FRODO You've only just arrived!
FRODO I don't understand...
Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo.
GANDALF Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it safe.
Gandalf hurries out the door...leaving FRODO standing alone in the Bag End.
The camera pushes in...the hum of the ring comes up on the soundtrack.
The camera pushes through the white paper to the ring...beneath the hum the whispered murmur of BLACK SPEECH can be heard.
The jagged ruins of" BARAD-DUR.
THE DARK TOWER!
TEASING IMAGES: THE HUGE DARK TOWER OF BARAD-DUR is being rebuilt!
Thousands of ORCS crawl over the surface, hauling stone and iron up the towering heights.
WIDE ON: MOUNT DOOM...A HUGE, BILLOWING CLOUD OF BLACK FILTH grows and spreads across the red streaked sky...casting a shadowy pall over the nightmarish landscape.
GOLLUM Baggins!
GOLLUM Shire!!
NINE BLACK RIDERS burst out of Minas Morgul and charge toward Camera.
WIDE ON: A LONE HORSEMAN gallops to the crest of a hill on the west road.
The main highway south to Minas Tirith...he looks toward the saw toothed mountains of Mordor...
...seeping out across the blood red sky, his face grave.
He spurs his horse on.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF making is way down into the lower depths of the Citidel.
CLOSE ON: Pages flipping as Gandalf searches ancient scrolls and books placed high on a wooden table.
His eyes settle on one old parchment.
He murmurs hurriedly to himself, reading.
GANDALF The year 3434 of the Second Age...here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor, and the finding of the ring of power.
GANDALF It has come to me...the ring of power!
GANDALF (CONT'D) It shall be an heirloom of my Kingdom...all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate, for I will risk no hurt to the
GANDALF (CONT'D) ring...it is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain...
GANDALF The marking upon the band begin to fade...the writing which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared...a secret now that only fire can tell...
FARMER MAGGOT is chopping wood in his garden CLOSE ON: SNORTING HORSE NOSTRILS...as the shadow of a black rider looms over a Hobbit House.
Terrified, FARMER MAGGOT cowers in his doorway...FANG, his dog, Whimpers and backs away.
BLACK RIDER Shire?
BLACK RIDER Baggins?
FARMER MAGGOT There's no Bagginses around here!
FARMER MAGGOT They are all up in Hobbiton...that way.
The BLACK RIDER GALLOPS AWAY AT SPEED
ANGLE ON: ROSIE COTTON bids the last of the Patron's "Goodnight"...Sam meets her eyes for a moment as he and Frodo leave the inn.
WIDE ON: FRODO FAREWELLS SAM outside Bag End, and heads towards the front door.
Creepy POV from inside Bag end: Frodo coming up the path.
FRODO enters Bag End...he immediately Pauses, sensing that something is amiss.
All is quiet...Frodo peers uneasily into the darkened living room.
SUDDENLY!
A large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for Frodo.
Frodo lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free and spins around to face his Assailant.
Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight.
Paranoia blazes in his eyes.
His clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling.
Hair and beard much longer an unkempt.
GANDALF Is it secret?
GANDALF Is it safe?
Frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest.
Gandalf, suspicious, Alert.
Without a word, Gandalf takes the envelope and tosses it into the fireplace!
FRODO What are you doing?
Flames instantly consume the envelope...revealing the ring, as it sinks into the red hot embers.
Gandalf reaches into the fire with a pair of tongs...he lifts the ring out.
GANDALF Hold out your hand, Frodo...it is quite cool.
Gandalf drops the ring into Frodo's hand...he reacts to its weight.
GANDALF (CONT'D) What can you see?
GANDALF (CONT'D) Can you see anything?
FRODO Nothing...there's nothing.
FRODO Wait...
CLOSE ON: The Gold Band of the ring as fiery letters begin to appear...a tiny inscription glows red...as if burning from within.
GANDALF ...these are markings.
FRO DO It's some form of Elvish...I can't read it.
GANDALF There are few who can...the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
Mordor?
In the common tongue it says, "One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them."
CLOSE ON: The ring lies on Frodo's simple kitchen table.
GANDALF This is the one ring forged by the dark lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt Doom...taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.
FRODO Bilbo found it...in Gollom's cave.
GANDALF For sixty years the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age...but no longer, Frodo.
GANDALF Evil is stirring in Mordor.
GANDALF The ring has awoken.
GANDALF It has heard its master's call.
AT THAT MOMENT A FLEETING, LOW WHISPER of BLACK SPEECH
emanates from the Ring.
Frodo looks at Gandalf, each knowing the other has heard it.
FRODO But he was destroyed...Sauron was destroyed.
ANGLE ON: THE RING lies between them on the table.
GANDALF No, Frodo.
GANDALF The spirit of Sauron has endured.
GANDALF His life force is bound to the ring and the ring survived.
GANDALF Sauron has returned.
GANDALF His Orcs have multiplied...his fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.
GANDALF Sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in the second darkness.
GANDALF He is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on it.
GANDALF For the ring yearns, above all else, to return to the hand of its master: they are one, the ring and the dark lord.
GANDALF Frodo, he must never find out.
GANDALF SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up the Ring.
FRODO Alright!
ANGLE ON: FRODO hurriedly entering the living room.
FRODO We put it away, we keep it hidden!
FRODO We never speak of it again.
FRODO No one know it's here, do they?
FRODO Gandalf shifts uncomfortably.
FRODO (CONT'D) Do they, Gandalf?
Gandalf looks at Frodo, sadly...
GANDALF There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring.
GANDALF I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum, but the enemy found him first.
CLOSE ON: A teasing Glimpse of Gollum being tortured by the Orcs.
The wretched creature screams in pain.
GANDALF (V.O.) I don't know how long they tortured him...but amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words.
GOLLUM S...Shire!
GOLLUM Baggins!
FRODO Shire!
FRODO Baggins!
FRODO That will lead them here!
IMAGE: On a dark country lane, a Hobbit bounder lifts his watch lantern in alarm.
HOBBIT BOUNDER Halt!
HOBBIT BOUNDER Who goes there?
Out of the darkness thunder two BLACK RIDERS...A LETHAL SWORD swings down at the small Hobbit bounder.
FRODO thrusts the ring at Gandalf.
FRODO Take it!
FRODO Take it!
GANDALF No, Frodo...
FRODO You must take it.
GANDALF You cannot offer me this ring.
FRODO I'm giving it to you!
GANDALF Don't tempt me, Frodo.
GANDALF I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe.
GANDALF Understand, Frodo...I would use this Ring from a desire to do good...but through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
FRODO But it cannot stay in the Shire!
GANDALF No, no it can't.
FRODO What must I do?
ANGLE ON: FRODO throwing clothes into a knapsack...Gandalf watches him, making plans...
GANDALF You must leave, and leave quickly.
GANDALF Get out of the Shire.
FRODO Where?
FRODO Where shall I go?
GANDALF Make for the village of Bree.
FRODO Bree?
FRODO What about you?
GANDALF I will, be waiting for you at the Inn of the Prancing Pony.
GANDALF Frodo packs his food into his knapsack.
FRODO And the ring will be safe there?
GANDALF I don't know, Frodo.
GANDALF I don't have any answers.
GANDALF I must see the Head of my Order.
GANDALF He is both wise and powerful.
GANDALF Trust me, Frodo.
GANDALF He'll know what to go.
Frodo is preparing to leave.
GANDALF You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you...for that name is not safe outside the Shire.
GANDALF GANDALF helps FRODO into his coat.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Travel only by day and stay off the road.
FRODO I can cut across country easily enough.
Gandalf looks at the young Hobbit, moved by his courage.
GANDALF My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing creatures.
GANDALF You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet, after a hundred years, they can still surprise you.
SUDDENLY!
A SOUND from outside.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Get down!
GANDALF FREEZES...
he moves quietly towards the window, eyes wide with tension.
He raises his staff above the window, and slams it down on the intruder.
THERE IS A YELP OF PAIN!
Gandalf hauls a small figure into the room...SAM GAMGEE sprawls across the floor!
He looks up in terror as Gandalf looms over him.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Confound it all!
GANDALF (CONT'D) Samwise Gamgee, have you been eavesdropping?
SAM I ain't been dropping no eaves, sir!
SAM Honest.
SAM I was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you follow me...
GANDALF It's a little late for trimming the hedges, don't you think?
SAM I heard raised voices...
GANDALF What did you hear?
GANDALF Speak!
SAM Nothing important...that is, I heard a good deal about a ring...and a Dark Lord.
SAM And something about the end of the world, but...Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me!
SAM Don't turn me into anything unnatural!
GANDALF No?
GANDALF Perhaps not.
GANDALF I've thought of a better use for you.
Wide on: HOBBITON...shrouded in a white veil of MIST.
WIDER: To reveal Gandalf, Frodo and Sam hurrying across a ploughed field, away from Hobbiton!
Gandalf leads his Horse...Frodo and Sam are carrying knapsacks.
GANDALF (V.O.) Come along, Samwise...keep up...
Gandalf leads Frodo and Sam under the cover of Woods.
GANDALF (V.O.) Be careful, both of you.
GANDALF (V.O.) The Enemy has many spies in his service, many ways of hearing...birds, beasts...
Gandalf takes Frodo to one side...
GANDALF (CONT'D) Is it safe?
FRODO NODS...he pats his pocket.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Never put it on, for then the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power...Always remember, Frodo, the ring is trying to get back to its master...it wants to be found.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Gandalf wheels his horse and gallops away.
MONTAGE: FRODO AND SAM hiking over the gentle Shire Countryside...wading through a shallow stream...heating a kettle over a small fire...clambering over stone walls.
Sam stops short...taking stock of his surroundings.
Sam looks back from where they came.
SAM This is it.
FRODO This is what?
SAM If I take one more step it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.
FRODO gives Sam a pat on the shoulder.
FRODO Come on, Sam.
Sam takes a deep breath and steps forward.
CLOSE ON: SAM'S brown, furry foot hits the ground.
FRODO Remember what Bilbo used to say...it's a dangerous business...
Frodo and Sam continue their journey.
BILBO (V.O.) ...
BILBO (V.O.) it's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door...you step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's not knowing where you might be swept off to.
Gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient forest of Fangorn.
Nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant Misty Mountains, the tall black tower of Orthanc is clearly visible
Gandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of ISENGARD...a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, encloses beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains.
SARUMAN (V.O.) Smoke rises once more from the mountain of doom...the shadow takes shape in the darkness of Mordor; the hour grows late...and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my counsel...
The strange tower of Orthanc...hewn from a solid pillar of black obsidian...rises up in the center of the Isengard Circle.
Gandalf arrives at the foot of the Orthanc Stairs.
ANGLE ON: SARUMAN, THE WHITE WIZARD he sweeps down the Orthanc stairs.
SARUMAN For that is why you have come, is it not, my old friend?
Gandalf moves quickly towards him, grimy and weary from his long ride.
GANDALF Saruman!
Gandalf and Saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees of Isengard, Saruman's clean, white robe contrasts with Gandalf's dusty grey robes.
SARUMAN Are you sure of this?
GANDALF Beyond any doubt.
SARUMAN So the ring of power has been found?
GANDALF All these long years it was in the Shire, under my very nose.
SARUMAN And yet you did not have the wit to see it!
SARUMAN Your love of the Halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.
GANDALF We still have time...time enough to counter Sauron...if we act quickly.
SARUMAN Time?
SARUMAN What time do you think we have?
Saruman and Gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber.
SARUMAN Sauron has regained much of his former strength.
SARUMAN He cannot yet take physical form...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.
SARUMAN Concealed within his fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all.
SARUMAN His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh.
SARUMAN You know of what I speak, Gandalf...a great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
GANDALF The eye of Sauron.
SARUMAN He is gathering all evil to him.
SARUMAN (CONT'D) Very soon he will have summoned an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle earth.
GANDALF You know this?
GANDALF How?
SARUMAN I have seen it.
Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...
GANDALF A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.
Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir.
SARUMAN Why?
SARUMAN Why should we fear to use it?
GANDALF They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones...we do not know who else may be watching.
GANDALF Gandalf throws the cloth back over the Palantir.
Saruman sits upon his throne.
SARUMAN The hour is later than you think.
SARUMAN Sauron's forces are already moving...the Nine have left Minas Morgul.
GANDALF The nine!
SARUMAN They crossed the river Isen in Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in black.
GANDALF They have reached the Shire?
GANDALF Saruman shrugs...
SARUMAN They will find the ring...and kill the one who carries it.
Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door...horrified as the doors suddenly slam shut.
SARUMAN (CONT'D) You did not seriously think a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?
SARUMAN (CONT'D) There are none who can.
Gandalf slowly turns to Saruman...a look of dawning horror.
SARUMAN (CONT'D) Against the power of Mordor, there can be no victory.
SARUMAN (CONT'D) We must join with him, Gandalf.
SARUMAN (CONT'D) We must join with Sauron.
SARUMAN (CONT'D) It would be wise, my friend.
GANDALF Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the wise abandon reason for madness?
At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
He slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen force.
With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff on Saruman...blasting him off his feet!
Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing them across the room.
SARUMAN SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING!
Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand!
Gandalf is flung to the floor.
SARUMAN I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly, but you have elected the way of pain.
Gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into the madness of Saruman...
Commanding two staffs, Saruman sends Gandalf into a sickening spin.
Gandalf tumbles towards the top of the chamber...as if falling in reverse.
Rushing POV: the roof of Orthanc rockets toward camera.
Wide on: Frodo and Sam walking along a country lane which borders Farmer Maggot's Fields.
Sam is looking up...Frodo has disappeared around a corner in the lane.
SAM Mr. Frodo.
SAM Mr. Frodo!
SAM Frodo turns, surprised as Sam comes running towards him.
SAM (CONT'D) I thought I lost you.
SAM (CONT'D) Frodo looks at Sam suspiciously.
SAM (CONT'D) Sam glances down, embarrassed.
FRODO What are you talking about?
SAM It's just something Gandalf said...
FRODO What did he say?
SAM He said..."
SAM Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
SAM And I don't mean to.
FRODO Sam...we're still in the Shire...what could possibly happen?
SUDDENLY!
A figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending Frodo flying.
Frodo picks himself up, only to be knocked back down again by Pippin.
PIPPIN Frodo!
PIPPIN Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
MERRY Hello Frodo
Merry, Pippin, and Frodo picking themselves up...
a variety of vegetables have scattered everywhere.
SAM What's the meaning of this!
MERRY Sam, hold this...
Merry gives Sam a large cabbage.
SAM You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!
A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the Hedgerow...angry shouts from Farmer Maggot.
FARMER MAGGOT Who's that in my field!
FARMER MAGGOT Get out of it!
FARMER MAGGOT Get out of my field, you young varmits!
FARMER MAGGOT I'll show you...get out of my corn.
Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race away...with Frodo and Sam on their heels.
MERRY I don't know why he's so upset, it's only a couple of carrots.
PIPPIN And some cabbages...and those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.
PIPPIN And then the mushrooms the week before.
MERRY Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly over reacting.
The BAYING OF LARGE DOGS sounds!
PIPPIN Run!
Frodo, Sam, and Merry and Pippin tumble head over heels down a bank, onto a dark, wooded road.
CLOSE ON: A winded Pippin, his face inches away from a large pile of Horse droppings...
PIPPIN That was close.
Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly.
MERRY Ow...I think I've broken something.
Pulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle, out from his back pocket.
MERRY (CONT'D) Oh.
SAM Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.
MERRY What?
MERRY That was just a detour...a shortcut.
SAM A shortcut to what?
Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of the road.
PIPPIN Mushrooms!
CLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy undergrowth.
Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the mushrooms!
Frodo is tense and watchful.
He realizes they are on a wooded road.
Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind...
FRODO I think we should get off the road.
A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature.
FRODO (CONT'D) Get off the road!
Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble down the bank, hiding under a mossy log.
THE SOUND OF HOOVES is close...
A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes !
Frodo freezes in terror.
The RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits very still with his head bowed, listening.
From inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent; his head turning from side to side.
Beads of sweat gather on his brow.
The ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering suspiciously into the woods.
He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE.
The SOUND OF SNIFFING intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to side like a bird of party.
SAM Frodo?
Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed.
Frodo instantly slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken
MERRY What was that?
Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand.
Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground.
SAM Anything?
FRODO Nothing.
PIPPIN What is going on?
Merry moves past pippin, toward Frodo, watching intently...Sam keeps looking around nervously.
MERRY The Black rider was looking for something...or someone...Frodo?
SAM Get down!
The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline.
The Four Hobbits...
sprawled on the ground, holding their breath.
The BLACK RIDER turns and departs.
FRODO I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I must get to Bree.
Merry looks at his friend...realizing Frodo is in deep trouble.
MERRY Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me !
The Hobbits break cover.
SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of the forest TOWARD THEM!
MERRY (CONT'D) There's another one!!
MERRY (CONT'D) Frodo, this way!
The Hobbits run THE RINGWRAITH SHRIEKS!
Black horse hooves...
snarling horse mouths...a fleeting black cowl.
MERRY (CONT'D) Frodo, follow me!
FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN, are running towards the wide, placid Brandywine river...and the FERRY.
MERRY Get the ropes, Sam.
Four RINGWRAITHS are speeding through the Fog...converging on the FERRY CROSSING.
The HOBBITS stampede across the Wharf and Tumble onto the Ferry.
SAM Frodo!
Frodo races across the Wooden Wharf, followed by the ringwraiths.
He leaps into the Ferry.
Sam and Merry shove off with the poles...the ferry slides out into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive.
They pull up on the end of the wharf...
shrieking with rage!
The Hobbits cover their ears.
The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards the north and Gallop away along the river bank, quickly disappearing into the fog.
FRODO How far to the nearest crossing?
MERRY The brandwine bridge...twenty miles.
Lights of Bree...a small village of stone and half timbered houses nestled against a low wooded hill.
A thick hedge surrounds the village...a great gate bars the western entrance.
FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN approaching the gatehouse...wild eyes, ragged, and out of breath.
FRODO Come on.
A SURLY GATEKEEPER glances down at them.
GATEKEEPER What do you want?
FRODO We're headed for the prancing pony.
The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight.
GATEKEEPER Hobbits!
GATEKEEPER Four Hobbits, and what's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
GATEKEEPER What business brings you to Bree?
FRODO We wish to stay at the inn...our business is our own.
FRODO To Frodo's relief, the Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.
GATEKEEPER All right, young sir, I meant no offense.
The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree...the gatekeeper eyeing them curiously in the lantern light.
GATEKEEPER (CONT'D) It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.
GATEKEEPER (CONT'D) There's talk of strange fold abroad...can't be too careful.
The tall BREE FOLK loom over the nervous little hobbits as Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin make their way through the Narrow Streets.
Tall buildings tower above them...lights glow dimly from behind thick curtains.
Close on: The sign of the "PRANCING PONY INN"...Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry toward it.
Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin come rushing in.
Frodo attracts the INN KEEPERS'S attention.
FRODO Excuse me.
BUTTERBUR Good evening, little masters.
BUTTERBUR If you're seeking accommodation, we've got some nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available, Mr...ah...
FRODO Underhill...my name's Underbill.
BUTTERBUR Underhill?
BUTTERBUR Hmmmm.
FRODO We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can you tell him we've arrived?
FRODO BUTTERBUR frowns...
BUTTERBUR Gandalf...Gandalf...Oh...
BUTTERBUR Oh yes!
BUTTERBUR I remember...elderly chap...big grey beard...pointy hat?
BUTTERBUR Frodo nods with relief...Butterbur shakes his head.
BUTTERBUR (CONT'D) Not seen him for six months.
BUTTERBUR (CONT'D) Frodo is shocked.
SAM What do we do now?
Wide on: the noise, smokey Inn.
It is dimly lit, cheifly from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of BIG FOLK, LOCAL HOBBITS, and a couple of dwarfs.
Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin are sitting at a table against the wall...
clearly trying to remain Quiet and inconspicuous...
Sam can't help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around.
FRODO Sam, he'll be here.
FRODO He'll come.
Merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large mug of beer.
PIPPIN What's that?
MERRY This, my friend, is a pint.
PIPPIN It comes in pints?
PIPPIN I'm getting one!
Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar.
SAM You've had a whole half already.
SAM Merry watches Pippin go.
A COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance at Frodo, then quickly look away.
SAM (CONT'D) That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we've arrived.
Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with gleaming eyes.
Frodo gestures to Butterbur...
FRODO Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is he?
BUTTERBUR He's one of them Rangers; they're dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds.
BUTTERBUR What his right name is, I never heard, but round here he's known as Strider.
FRODO Strider.
BENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE
Sweat runs down his brow.
The Strange hum of the Ring spills into the Soundtrack.
"Baggins...Baggins..."
a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:
PIPPIN Baggins?
PIPPIN Sure, I know a Baggins...he's over there...
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.
Frodo leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar.
PIPPIN Frodo Baggins.
PIPPIN He's my second cousin once removed, on his mother's side and my third cousin twice removed on his father's side...if you follow me.
Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.
FRODO Pippin!
PIPPIN Steady on, Frodo!
Pippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls to the floor.
At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all the attention turns to Frodo...
The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto his out stretched finger.
FRODO VANISHES!
There is a sharp intake of breath...followed by total silence.
The RINGWRAITHS turn sharply in their saddles...Instantly aware that the ring is being worn.
They spur their horses towards the distant lights of Bree.
Sam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly; the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into excited babble.
FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring: THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative quality.
FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow motion background.
He suddenly clutches his head as he is hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE!
AN EVIL CAT-LIKE EYE, wreathed in flames.
There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death...
FRODO is terrified!
He rolls under a table, desperately pulling the ring from his finger.
FRODO MATERIALIZES into the real world.
AT THAT MOMENT: A LARGE HAND reaches under the table and Grabs Frodo by the collar, and DRAGS HIM AWAY!
Frodo is roughly pushed against the wall.
The Brooding stranger looms over him.
STRIDER You draw far too much attention to yourself...Mr.
STRIDER Underhill
Frodo is pushed into the Hobbit's room by Strider.
FRODO What do you want?
STRIDER A little more caution from you...that is no trinket you carry.
FRODO I carry nothing.
STRIDER Indeed?
STRIDER I can usually avoid being seen if I wish, but to disappear entirely...
STRIDER that is a rare gift.
FRODO Who are you?
STRIDER Are you frightened?
FRODO Yes.
STRIDER Not nearly frightened enough.
STRIDER I know what hunts you.
STRIDER Frodo jumps at the sound of a noise in the corridor.
STRIDER Strider deftly draws his sword.
The door bursts open and Sam, Merry and Pippin appear on the doorway.
Sam is Squaring off with is fists, Merry brandishes a candlestick, and Pippin a chair.
SAM Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!
STRIDER SHEATHS his sword, a slight smile playing on his lips.
STRIDER You have a stout heart, little Hobbit, but that alone won't save you...You can no longer wait for the Wizard, Frodo.
STRIDER They're coming.
The gate keeper comes out of his Lodgings with a lantern...a look of fear on his face.
He approaches the closed gate with great apprehension.
CLOSE ON: The Gatekeeper peers out of his Peephole.
The gate crashed down on the gatekeeper...as four RINGWRAITHS ride into Bree!
The four RINGWRAITHS fly done the empty streets, like horsemen of the apocalypse.
LOW ANGLE: the front door FLIES OPEN.
The FOUR RINGWRAITHS rush into the PRANCING PONY with WICKED SWORDS DRAWN.
CLOSE ON: BUTTERBUR hiding behind his bar...
trembling and sweating in TERROR.
INSERT: PIPPIN stirs slightly, then settles back to sleep.
WIDE ON: the door creaks open...THE FOUR RINGWRAITHS silently slide into the Hobbit's room.
The LOOM above each bed, raising their SHINING SWORDS ABOVE THE SLEEPING HOBBITS.
QUICK INSERT: Sam's eyes open wide.
In unison, the RINGWRAITS STAB THE HOBBITS, in a Slashing, hacking frenzy.
Strider is grimly listening to the sounds from his room.
Wide on: the RINGWRAITHS step back from the slashed beds in triumph.
CLOSE ON: a hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal nothing but a shredded pillow.
The RINGWRAITHS SHRIEK WITH RAGE!!
INSERTS: Sam sits up with a start!
Close on: Another shredded pillow is revealed!
More Shrieks of rage.
INSERT: PIPPIN AND MERRY wake with a start.
WIDE ON: Sam, Merry, and Pippin have been sleeping on Strider's bed.
Frodo stands next to Strider by the window, peering out nervously as furious Ringwraith screeches echo across the courtyard from the Hobbits room.
FRODO Where are they?
STRIDER They were once men.
STRIDER Strider glances quickly at Frodo, then looks away...
STRIDER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Great Kings of men.
STRIDER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Then Sauron the deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of Power.
STRIDER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Blinded by their greed they took them without question, one by one falling into darkness and now they are slaves to his will.
Strider looks from the window as the Ringwraiths gallop down the Bree Streets.
CLOSE ON: Strider turns back to the Hobbits, his face lit faintly by the Glowing Embers of the Fire.
STRIDER (CONT'D) They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither living or dead.
STRIDER (CONT'D) At all times they feel the presence of the ring...drawn to the power of the one..they will never stop hunting you.
STRIDER, MERRY, PIPPIN, AND FRODO march through a gloomy, overgrown forest.
Sam follows at the read leading "Bill", a scrawny pony, who is laden with supplies.
FRODO Where are you taking us?
STRIDER Into the wild.
Frodo watches uneasily as Strider moves off into the cover of the trees...
MERRY How do, we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?
FRODO We have no choice but to trust him.
STRIDER But where is he leading us?
Strider stops, casts a glance back at Sam.
STRIDER (CONT'D) To Rivendell, Master Gamgee...to the house of Elrond.
SAM looks excited.
SAM Did you hear that, Bill?
SAM Rivendell!
SAM We're going to see the Elves!
Strider leads the Hobbits through the gloom of the forest.
Aerial on: Strider leading Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin across the windswept moors.
The hobbits suddenly stop and unstrap their knapsacks.
STRIDER Gentlemen, we do not stop until nightfall.
PIPPIN What about breakfast?
STRIDER You've already had it.
PIPPIN We've had one, yes...but what about Second Breakfast?
Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking his head.
MERRY I don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.
PIPPIN What about Elvenses, Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, dinner...he knows about them, doesn't he?
MERRY I wouldn't count on it.
An apple is thrown to Merry, who deftly catches it.
Another, aimed at Pippin, catches him on the forehead.
MERRY (CONT'D) Pippin!
The hobbits trudge through rain, looking tired, hungry, and miserable.
Saruman stands over the Palantir, his hands cupping the massive eye.
SARUMAN The power of Isengard is at your command, Sauron, Lord of the Earth.
SARUMAN Build me an army worth of Mordor.
Saruman is seated as his ORC OVERSEER approaches.
ORC OVERSEER What orders from Mordor, my Lord.
ORC OVERSEER What does the eye command?
SARUMAN We have work to do.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF...lying unconscious on a cold obsidian floor.
He wakes to the sound of ripping and tearing...rising onto his knees...lifting his head...
Gandalf stands as the camera pulls back to reveal him stranded on the summit of Orthanc.
He is marooned on the tiny, flat peak, surrounded on all sides by a sheer 500 FOOT DROP.
Another whispering wail rends the air.
Gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and peers down: POV: One of the beautiful Isengard trees is being ripped from the ground by the ORCS.
Gandalf looks on in Horror as ORCS hack into the trunk with axes.
SARUMAN stands in Rain looking out into the dark night...the ORC overseer sidles up to him, axe in hand, sweating with exertion.
ORC OVERSEER The trees are strong, my Lord.
ORC OVERSEER Their roots go deep.
SARUMAN Rip them all down.
CAMERA CIRCLES SUMMIT: MORE AND MORE TREES are hauled down and killed...as Gandalf looks on in helpless despair.
Wide on: The rugged countryside as the hobbits journey on, lead by Strider.
Strider stops before a distant hill, topped by an Ancient Ruin.
SARUMAN This was once the great Watchtower of Amon Sul.
SARUMAN We shall rest here tonight.
FRODO, MERRY, AND PIPPIN collapse into a small hollow, halfway up Weathertop...they are muddy and exhausted.
Stider drops 4 small swords at the Hobbits feet.
SARUMAN There are for you.
SARUMAN Keep them close.
SARUMAN I'm going to have a look around.
SARUMAN Stay here.
Close on: Frodo...eyes flickering open.
He suddenly sits up, sniffing the air.
Sam, Merry, and Pippin huddled over a small fire...
Sausages and bacon sizzle in a hot frying pan.
FRODO What are you doing?
MERRY Tomatoes, sausages, and crispy bacon.
SAM We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
FRODO Put it out, you fools!
FRODO Put it out!
FRODO Frodo desperately kicks dirt on the fire!
PIPPIN Oh, that's nice...ash on my tomatoes!
FIVE RINGWRAITHS ON FOOT, running up the steep slope unnaturally fast.
FRODO Go!
Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin clamber desperately towards the summit, clutching their swords.
Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin race into a RING OF BROKEN STONES on the summit or Weathertop...the ruined base of an ancient tower.
The hobbits stand back-to-back in the centre of the Ring, waiting for the first assault...
One by one, the 5 Ringwraiths appear...brandishing Gleaming swords, they move slowly towards the hobbits.
In the center is their leader...the WITCH KING!
SAM Back, you devils!
Sam rushes forward with a cry.
He swings his sword at the Witch King, who blocks the blow with his own sword.
Sam's blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist, sending Sam flying.
Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror, throw themselves flat on the ground.
THE RINGWRAITHS close in on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head...
Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS...
slow motion as his hand goes into his pocket and pulls out the ring.
The 5 Ringwraiths utter a chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT.
Frodo is unable to resist any longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring.
He disappears.
SAM (CONT'D) No!
Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world...he looks upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE: Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and Pallid, ruthless faces.
THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger.
Frodo's trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.
The witch king snarls and springs forward.
He stabs at Frodo with a wicked dagger!
Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger sinks into his shoulder.
Suddenly, Strider charges at the RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch in the other.
He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea of mist.
Frodo sinks to the ground.
Behind him is a faint image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.
With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off his finger...
...Appearing back in the real world, Sam rushes over to him.
SAM (CONT'D) Frodo!
Another Ringwraith is burning and screaming...others screech fearfully at the flames, turn and flee form the Weathertop summit.
SAM (CONT'D) Mr. Frodo!!
Strider kneels before Frodo.
He snatches up the Witch King's Dagger from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin, blade.
SAM (CONT'D) Help him, Strider!
STRIDER He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.
STRIDER The Morgul Blade suddenly melts...vanishing into the air like smoke.
STRIDER Strider throws the hilt down in disgust...
SAM Do something.
STRIDER This is beyond my skill to heal.
STRIDER He needs Elvish medicine.
STRIDER Strider lifts Frodo onto his shoulders.
Strider is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing Frodo on his back.
Sam, Merry, and Pippin are running to keep up.
The hobbits are carrying Flaming torches for protection.
STRIDER Hurry!
SAM We are six days from Rivendell.
SAM Frodo groans.
STRIDER Hold on, Frodo.
He'll never make it!
Close on: Frodo...head lolling about, barely conscious.
FRODO Gandalf...Gandalf?
Low angle...looking up at ORTHANC...the tower of Isengard, gleaming in the moonlight.
The camera rises to reveal the once beautiful gardens are not a pitted wasteland...with smoke and fire billowing out
of numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt of ORTHANC.
Strange guttural chants echo up from deep underground.
The camera is rising...a small moth flutters into shot...and leads the camera towards the summit or Orthanc.
Gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very top of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop.
He looks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep.
The MOTH flutters close to Gandalf.
His hand suddenly moves at lighting speed and SNATCHES THE MOTH.
Gandalf brings his hand close to his face and opens it.
The moth sits on the palm of his hand as Gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue.
Close on: THE MOTH'S face...
seemingly listening.
It suddenly flutters away.
CAMERA FOLLOWS the moth off the Orthanc summit, but drops past the moth...falling down, down, towards the pitted wasteland, straight into a fiery red tunnel!
The dead trees of Isengard are fed into roaring furnaces...molten metal pours into casts...red hot metal, beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths...armor and weapons are forged from the great furnaces.
Saruman strides among the ORCS and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes its birthing membrane...this is LURTZ, who rises up to stand before his master.
Close on: Frodo...his eyes flicker open...clouded, red- rimmed...his brow, beaded with sweat.
PIPPIN Is he going to die?
PIPPIN Frodo's breathing is getting shallow.
PIPPIN Strider looks out into the darkness.
STRIDER No.
STRIDER He is passing into the shadow world, he will soon become a wraith like them.
A DISTANT CRY of a RINGWRAITH carries through the air.
MERRY They're close.
Frodo gasps in sudden pain.
STRIDER Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?
STRIDER Sam looks blank.
SAM Athelas?
STRIDER Kingsfoil.
SAM Kingsfoil.
SAM Aye.
SAM It's a weed.
STRIDER It may help to slow the poison.
STRIDER Hurry!
Sam and Strider desperately search the dark forest floor for the Athelas plant.
Close on: A small, white flowered plant!
Strider drops to one knee, carefully pulling it from the ground.
ARWEN What is this?
ARWEN A Ranger caught off his guard?
Strider slowly looks up.
Frodo is breathing hard, desperately ill.
Frodo's half- conscious POV: Surreal impression...a SHIMMERING FIGURE IN WHITE leaps off a horse.
FLASH INSERT: An ethereal vision of ARWEN, as she appears on the other side...
ARWEN Frodo, Im Arwen...telin let thaed.
ARWEN I am Arwen, I have come here to help you.
ARWEN Lasto Beth nin, tolo Dan na ngalad.
ARWEN Hear my voice, come back to the light.
ARWEN Frodo's eyes close.
PIPPIN Who is she?
ARWEN Frodo?
SAM She's an elf.
Who now appears in her earth bound form, a young Elven woman with tousled hair, dressed in mud-splattered riding clothes.
ARWEN He's fading...he's not gong to last.
ARWEN We must get him to my father.
ARWEN Strider quickly lifts Frodo...placing him on the horse.
ARWEN (CONT'D) I have been looking for you for two days.
PIPPIN Where are you taking him?
ARWEN There are five Wraiths behind you, where the other four are, I do not know.
STRIDER Dartho guin Berian...rych le ad tolthathon.
STRIDER Stay with the hobbits...I'11 send horses for you.
STRIDER Close on: Arwen grabbing the Reins of the horse.
ARWEN Hon mabathon.
ARWEN Rochoh ellint im.
ARWEN I'll take him.
ARWEN I'm the faster rider.
ARWEN Strider clamps his hand over Arwen's.
STRIDER Andelu I ven.
STRIDER The road is too dangerous.
ARWEN Frodo Fir.
ARWEN Ae anthradon I hir, tur gwaith nin beriatha hon.
ARWEN If I can cross the river, the power of my people can protect him.
PIPPIN What are they saying?
CLOSE ON: Arwen reaches for Strider's hand...looking deep into his eyes.
ARWEN I do not fear them.
CLOSE ON: Strider...we see that it is hard for him to let her go.
Arwen mounts her horse, ALSFORTH...
STRIDER Arwen...ride hard, don't look back.
Arwen looks down at Strider as she supports Frodo with one hand.
ARWEN Noro Lim, Asfaloth, Noro Lim!
SAM What are you doing!
SAM Those Wraiths are still out there!
Asfaloth springs away, bearing Arwen and Frodo into the night.
SPEEDING POV: through the forest from the back of the White Horse.
ANGLE ON: FRODO, BOUNCING IN THE SADDLE, he lifts his head weakly.
SURREAL SLOW MOTION POV: THE HORSES HEAD BOBBING...trees sliding by...moonlight flickers through the trees.
AERIAL: of Arwen's white horse emerging from the trees...and galloping across the open land as the sun rises.
The white horse charges through a Pine Forest.
Suddenly 2 Galloping Ringwraiths emerge from the trees behind!
2 more Ringwraiths slide in from different directions to join the chase.
Arwen grits her teeth...urges the white horse to greater speed.
The white horse speeds out of the pine trees...the 4 ringwraiths close behind PAN ONTO: 2 more ringwraiths galloping down the hillside!
AERIAL SHOT: 3 MORE RINGWRAITHS enter frame from different directions...a total of 9 RINGWRAITHS now pursuing Frodo and Arwen!
CLOSE ON: Panting head of the WHITE ELVEN HORSE.
ARWEN Noro lim, Asfaloth!
CRANE DOWN: As the White Horse races towards Camera, to Reveal the wide river Bruinen in the foreground.
Without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow water and thunders across the Ford.
The 9 Ringwraiths pull up short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water.
The white horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford.
WITCH KING Give up the Halfling, she-elf!
WITCH KING She draws her sword and yells at the Witch King.
ARWEN If you want him, come and claim him.
THE WITCH KING SCREECHES ANGRILY, draws his sword, and leads the Ringwraiths across the Ford.
The water starts flowing faster...a distant rumble can be heard.
Arwen waits until they are halfway across: she suddenly stands in the saddle arms raised!
ARWEN (CONT'D) Non o Chithaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo nin Briunen Dan in Ulaer!
ARWEN (CONT'D) Nin o Chitaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo nin Bruinen Dan in Ulaer!
Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had burst!
The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing white horses with frothing manes!
The Ringwraiths scream in terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge.
Their Piercing cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries them away!
CLOSE ON: FRODO as he loses consciousness...
ARWEN No, no...Frodo, no!
ARWEN Frodo, don't give in...not now!
Arwen gathers the small Hobbit in her arms, feeling his life slip away.
ARWEN (V.O.) What grace is given me, let it pass to him.
ARWEN (V.O.) Let him be spared.
ARWEN (V.O.) Save him.
IMAGE: A BRIGHT LIGHT suddenly flares...Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, gasping.
FRODO Where am I?
A FAMILIAR VOICE cuts through the swirl of sound.
GANDALF You are in the House of Elrond, and it is ten o'clock in the morning on October the twenty-fourth, if you want to know.
Frodo's eyes flicker Open He is lying in bed next to an Open Window...Dappled sunlight plays on richly carved timbers...the sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the Vista of Fir Trees.
FRODO Gandalf!
ANGLE ON: GANDALF IS SITTING NEXT TO FRODO'S BED... softly puffing on his pipe.
He smiles at Frodo.
GANDALF Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be here, too.
GANDALF A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid.
GANDALF You have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.
Frodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly...
FRODO What happened, Gandalf?
FRODO Why didn't you meet us?
GANDALF I'm sorry Frodo.
Close on: Gandalf...
troubled.
His eyes drift away.
GANDALF (CONT'D) I was delayed.
SARUMAN stands over Gandalf, gloating...
SARUMAN Get up!
SARUMAN So much for the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction!
With the power of his staff, Saruman raises Gandalf from the ground, then sends him crashing to the floor.
GANDALF There is only one Lord of the Ring.
GANDALF Only one who can bend it to his will...and he does not share power.
SUDDENLY!
GANDALF lurches to his feet and Throws himself off the Tower!
Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from Isengard...on the Back of a GIANT EAGLE.
SARUMAN So you have chosen death!
Gwaihir the Eagle soars majestically over the mountains, carrying Gandalf towards the dawn.
Frodo raises himself up and looks at Gandalf.
FRODO Gandalf!
FRODO What is it?
FRODO Gandalf returns his attention to Frodo.
GANDALF Nothing, Frodo...
Sam runs to Frodo's bedside.
He is overjoyed to find Frodo awake.
SAM Frodo!
SAM Frodo!
SAM Bless you, you're awake!!
GANDALF Sam has hardly left your side.
SAM We were worried about you--weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?
GANDALF By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend.
GANDALF ELROND, LORD OF THE HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's
bedside...his face is neither old nor young, though in it is written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.
ELROND Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
ELROND Frodo sits up, looking at Elrond with awe.
WIDE ON: RIVENDELL...
a small cluster of elegant Elven Buildings sitting in a Shangri-la like Valley below towering cliffs and snow capped mountains.
ELROND (V.O.) You have found your way to the last homely house east of the sea.
ELROND (V.O.) The elves of Imladris have dwelt within this valley for three thousand years through few of my kin now remain.
ELROND (V.O.) Frodo looks out from his balcony.
Frodo and Sam walk together.
Suddenly, the voices of Merry and Pippin can be heard as they bound up to Frodo and throw their arms around him.
MERRY Frodo!
MERRY Frodo!
Sam looks past Frodo smiling...
a bent figure sits alone on a bench, in the Sun.
Close on: Frodo turning, following Sam's gaze...
FRODO Bilbo!
Close on: BILBO BAGGINS!
He breaks in to a broad grin as Frodo rushes forward to embrace him.
Bilbo has aged significantly since we last saw him.
BILBO Hello, Frodo, my lad!
FRODO Bilbo!
LATER...
Frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal:
FRODO (CONT'D) "There and back again: A Hobbit's tale" by Bilbo Baggins.
Bilbo smiles Proudly.
He is sitting with Frodo on a terrace overlooking a Waterfall.
Frodo looks at Page after page of beautiful Handwriting, with intricate Maps and Drawings.
FRODO (CONT'D) This is wonderful.
BILBO I meant to go back...wander the paths of Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely Mountain again...but age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.
Frodo turns a page...there before him, is a map of the Shire.
FRODO I miss the Shire...I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else...off with you, on one of your adventures...
FRODO But my own adventure, turned out to be quite different...I'm not like you, Bilbo.
BILBO My dear boy...
Sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his already full pack...pots and pans, blankets, cooking utensils, provisions, clothes.
SAM No, what have I forgotten?
SAM Pull back to reveal Frodo, hands in his pocket, watching Sam.
FRODO Packed already?
Sam looks up, startled.
SAM No harm in being prepared.
SAM Frodo strolls to the edge of the Balcony.
FRODO I thought you wanted to see the Elves, Sam?
SAM I do...
FRODO More than anything.
SAM I did.
SAM It's just...we did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?
SAM We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell...and I thought...
SAM seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon.
SAM Off home.
FRODO You're right, Sam.
FRODO Frodo looks at Sam...
FRODO (CONT'D) ...we did what we set out to do.
FRODO (CONT'D) Frodo opens his hand, the Ring sits in his Palm.
FRODO (CONT'D) The ring will be safe in Rivendell.
FRODO (CONT'D) I am ready to go home.
Gandalf and Elrond watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony,
ELROND His strength returns.
GANDALF That wound will never fully heal.
GANDALF He will carry it the rest of his life.
ELROND And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.
GANDALF It is a burden he should never have to had to bear.
GANDALF We can ask no more of Frodo.
ELROND Gandalf, the enemy is moving.
ELROND Sauron's forces are massing in the east.
ELROND His eye is fixed on Rivendell.
ELROND And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.
ELROND Our list of allies grows thin.
GANDALF His treachery runs deeper than you know.
GANDALF By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.
GANDALF An army that can move in Sunlight and cover great distance at speed.
GANDALF Saruman is coming for the Ring.
Elrond turns and walks away...
ELROND This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves...We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay here.
Gandalf turns and looks out the window.
Sounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.
ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D) This peril belongs to all Middle earth.
ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D) They must decide how to end it.
ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D) Not just for themselves but for those who come after.
ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D) Elrond approaches Gandalf.
ELROND (CONT'D) The time of the Elves is over.
ELROND (CONT'D) My people are leaving these shores.
ELROND (CONT'D) Who will you look to when we have gone?
ELROND (CONT'D) The dwarves?
ELROND (CONT'D) They hide in their mountains seeking riches.
ELROND (CONT'D) They care nothing for the troubles of others.
GANDALF It is in Men that we must place our hope.
ELROND Men?
ELROND Men are weak.
ELROND The race of Men is failing.
ELROND The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten.
ELROND It is because of men the Ring survives.
FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off Sauron's finger.
Elrond reacts.
ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D) I was there, Gandalf...I was there three thousand years ago when Isildur took the ring.
ELROND I was there the day the strength of Men failed.
Isildur...hurry...follow me!
IMAGES: ELROND leads Isildur into the steaming volcano.
ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D) I let Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom, where the ring was forged: the one place it could be destroyed.
ELROND Cast it into the fire...destroy it!
ISILDUR No.
Isildur turns and walks away
ELROND Isildur!!
Elrond turns to Gandalf.
ELROND It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure.
ELROND Isildur kept the Ring...and the line of Kings was broken.
ELROND There's no strength left in the world of Men.
ELROND They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
GANDALF There is one who could unite them, one who could re claim the thrown of Gondor.
ELROND He turned from that path a long time ago.
ELROND He has chosen exile.
Strider watches from the shadows...as Boromir strolls through the darkened gallery.
Boromir's eyes are drawn to an old Fresco on the wall...depicting Isildur defeating Sauron.
Boromir looks with Wonderment at Narsil, the Broken Blade of Elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth.
BOROMIR The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.
BOROMIR Boromir picks up the sword and gently touches the Blade.
BOROMIR Close on: a small bloom of blood appears on Boromir's finger...
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Still sharp.
Boromir senses Strider's presence...he looks from the blade to Strider, as if sensing a connection.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) But no more than a broken heirloom.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) replaces the Broken blade, but it clatters to the floor.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Boromir walks away, leaving Strider sitting alone.
Close on: Strider picks up the broken hilt, as Arwen appears behind him.
ARWEN Why do you fear the past?
ARWEN You are Isildur's heir...not Isildur himself.
ARWEN You are not bound to his fate.
STRIDER The same blood flows in my veins...the same weakness...
ARWEN Your time will come.
ARWEN You will face the same evil...and you will defeat it.
ARWEN A si i-duath u-orthor, Aragorn...u or le a u or nin.
ARWEN The shadow does not hold sway yet...not over you and not over me.
Night falls upon the beautiful valley of Rivendell...
still and quiet.
Strider and Arwen stand upon a stone bridge...the Evenstar at Arwen's breast shines in the moonlight.
ARWEN Renech I lu I erui govannem?
ARWEN Do you remember when we first met?
STRIDER Nauthannim I ned ol reniannen.
STRIDER I thought I had strayed into a dream.
Arwen reaches up and gently touches the Grey at Strider's temples.
ARWEN Gwenin in enniath...u-arnech in naeth I se celich.
ARWEN Long years have passed...you did not have the care you carry now.
Arwen looks into Strider's eyes.
ARWEN (CONT'D) Renech I Beth I pennen?
ARWEN (CONT'D) Do you remember what I told you?
ARWEN (CONT'D) Arwen reaches for Strider's hand...
STRIDER You said you'd bind yourself to me, forsaking the immortal life of your people.
ARWEN And to that I hold.
ARWEN I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone.
ARWEN Strider looks down.
ARWEN In his hand lies the Evenstar.
ARWEN (CONT'D) I choose a mortal live.
STRIDER You cannot give me this.
ARWEN It is mine to give to whom I will, like my heart.
Arwen closes Strider's fingers around the jewel.
Arwen leans towards Strider, gently kissing him.
Elrond addresses the council...
ELROND Strangers from distant lands ...
ELROND friends of old.
ELROND You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.
ELROND Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
ELROND None can escape it.
ELROND You will unite...or you will fall.
ELROND Each race is bound to this fate...this one doom...
Frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of Middle earth, Elrond stands before them, addressing Gandalf, Strider, Legolas, and 20 other elves, Dwarves, and men.
ELROND (CONT'D) Bring forth the ring, Frodo.
Frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone Plinth.
He places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat.
BOROMIR So it is true!
LEGOLAS Sauron's Ring!
LEGOLAS The ring of power!
GIMLI The doom of man!
BOROMIR It is a gift...a gift to the foes of Mordor!
BOROMIR Why not use this Ring?
BOROMIR Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, held the forces of Mordor at bay...by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe.
BOROMIR Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy...let us use it against him!
STRIDER You cannot wield it.
STRIDER None of us can.
STRIDER The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it has no other master.
STRIDER Boromir turns and looks at Strider, coolly.
BOROMIR And what would a ranger know of this matter?
Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively.
LEGOLAS stands...
LEGOLAS This is no mere Ranger.
LEGOLAS He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
LEGOLAS You owe him your allegiance.
Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply.
BOROMIR Aragorn?
BOROMIR This is Isildur's heir?
LEGOLAS And heir to the throne of Gondor.
ARAGORN Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas..
BOROMIR Gondor needs no king.
GANDALF Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.
ELROND You have only one choice..the ring must be destroyed.
The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears.
Gimli suddenly stands, excited.
GIMLI Then...what are we waiting for?
Gimli suddenly rushes forward!
He swings his axe down on the ring.
The axe shatters with a deafening crack!
Gimli falls backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed!
Frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him!
He slumps in this chair, clutching his forehead.
Gandalf looks at him with concern.
ELROND The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any craft that we
ELROND (CONT'D) here possess.
ELROND (CONT'D) The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom...only there can it be unmade.
ELROND (CONT'D) It must be taken deep into Mordor, and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.
ELROND (CONT'D) One of you must do this.
Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them.
Boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice
BOROMIR One does not simply walk into Mordor.
BOROMIR Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.
BOROMIR There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
BOROMIR It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust...the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.
BOROMIR Not with ten thousand men could you do this.
BOROMIR It is folly.
LEGOLAS Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
LEGOLAS The ring must be destroyed.
GIMLI And I suppose you think you're the one to do it?
BOROMIR And if we fail, what then?
BOROMIR What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?
Gimli leaps to his feet!
GIMLI I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!
GIMLI A STORM OF ARGUMENT
erupts around the room.
CLOSE ON: FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in slow
motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows louder in his head.
GIMLI (CONT'D) Never trust an Elf!
CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow across the surface...
flames flicker within the Gold Band.
GANDALF Do you not understand?
GANDALF While we bicker among ourselves, Sauron's power grows!
GANDALF No one will escape it.
GANDALF You will all be destroyed, your homes burnt and your families put to the sword!
CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of his hideous vision.
With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears his gaze upon the ring.
Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in a strong, clear voice.
FRODO I will take it...I will take it...I will take the Ring to Mordor.
Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded faces.
FRODO (CONT'D) Though...I do not know the way.
FRODO (CONT'D) Gandalf rises to his feet.
GANDALF I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.
ARAGORN If, by my life or death, I can protect you, I will.
ARAGORN ...you have my sword.
ARAGORN Aragorn steps forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli.
LEGOLAS And you have my bow.
GIMLI And my axe.
Boromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo.
BOROMIR You carry the fate of us all, little one.
Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) If this is indeed the will of the Council, then Gondor will see it done.
Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle earth stand at his side.
SAM Here!
A Sudden Noise...Sam pops up from behind a Bush!
SAM (CONT'D) Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me.
ELROND No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to separate you...even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.
Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush!
MERRY Oi!
MERRY We're coming too!
MERRY You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.
PIPPIN Anyway...you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission...quest...thing...
MERRY Well, that rules you out, Pip.
ELROND Nine companions ...
ELROND so be it.
ELROND You shall be the "Fellowship of the ring"
PIPPIN Great.
PIPPIN Where are we going?
Close on: An old sword sliding out of a shabby leather Scabbard...its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold and bright.
BILBO My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!
Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo.
FRODO It's so light!
BILBO Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
BILBO The blade glows blue when Orcs are close...and it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful.
Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail.
BILBO (CONT'D) Here's a pretty thing.
BILBO (CONT'D) Mithril, as light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.
BILBO (CONT'D) Let me see you put it on.
BILBO (CONT'D) Come on.
CLOSE ON: Frodo peels off his shirt...
revealing The Ring on the Chain around his neck.
BILBO (CONT'D) Oh!
BILBO (CONT'D) My old Ring...
BILBO (CONT'D) Frodo frowns as Bilbo moves toward him.
BILBO (CONT'D) I should very much like to hold it again, one last time.
BILBO (CONT'D) Bilbo reaches forward, eyes locked on the ring.
Suddenly!
A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony, groping hands.
Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands.
Bilbo falters...his eyes filling with tears.
BILBO (CONT'D) Oh!
BILBO (CONT'D) I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you, my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.
BILBO (CONT'D) I'm sorry for everything.
Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him.
The Fellowship climb the long steep path out of the cloven vale of Rivendell.
The fellowship trekking through a land of Deep Valleys and turbulent waters...the misty mountains rise sharply to their left.
GANDALF (V.O.) We must hold to his course west of the misty Mountains for forty days.
GANDALF (V.O.) If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.
GANDALF (V.O.) From there, our road turns east, to Mordor.
CLOSE ON: Sam at the campfire.
The sound of clashing swords!
Wider: Aragorn and Boromir are giving Pippin Sword tuition...
BOROMIR Get away from the blade, Pippin...on your toes...good, very good...I want you to react, not think.
SAM Should not be too hard...
BOROMIR Move your feet.
MERRY Quite good, Pippin.
PIPPIN Thanks.
CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf....
GIMLI If anyone were to ask for my opinion, which I note they have not, I would say we are taking the long way round.
GIMLI Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of Moria.
GIMLI My cousin, Balin, would give us a royal welcome.
GIMLI Gandalf clearly thinks that is a bad idea.
GANDALF No, Gimli.
GANDALF I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.
Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand.
Pippin throws down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to the ground.
Much laughter.
Legolas' eyes are fixed on a distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying smoke in the wind.
SAM What is that?
GIMLI Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud.
BOROMIR It's moving fast...against the wind.
LEGOLAS Crebain from Dunland!
ARAGORN Hide!
BOROMIR Merry..Pippin...Sam...take cover!
BOROMIR WIDE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what little cover
there is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at Great speed, wheeling and circling above.
As their dark shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the south.
Gandalf staggers to his feet.
GANDALF Spies of Saruman.
GANDALF The passage South is being watched.
Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing towards a high mountain pass.
GANDALF (CONT'D) We must take the pass of Caradhras!
The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow.
CLOSE ON: Frodo slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring falls on the ground...
CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the snow!
Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands, the ring dangling before his eyes.
He seems to grow in stature, as if absorbing its power.
Aragorn warily approaches Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as if transfixed.
ARAGORN Boromir?
BOROMIR It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing...such a little thing.
ARAGORN Boromir...give the ring to Frodo.
ARAGORN ARAGORN'S HAND moves to his sword hilt.
Ring's POV...looking up at Boromir's face.
The strange hum vibrates on the soundtrack.
CLOSE ON: a Weird beatific smile lights up Boromir's face...The HUM grows to a Deafening roar!
Boromir suddenly snaps out of his trance and hands the ring back to Frodo.
BOROMIR As you wish.
BOROMIR I care not.
Boromir smiles at Frodo, ruffling his hair.
CLOSE ON: ARAGON unhands his sword.
Following the crows as they race deeper and deeper, passing a vista of Industry, Hundreds of Orcs and writhing Birthsacks...flying past Saruman, who stands upon a wooden Gantry.
CLOSE ON: Saruman, listening to the Cries of the crows.
SARUMAN So, Gandalf...you try to lead them over Caradhras.
SARUMAN And if that fails...where then will you go?
SARUMAN THE FELLOWSHIP struggles through the snow.
SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) If the mountain defeats you, will you risk a more dangerous road?
THE FELLOWSHIP are struggling through a blinding blizzard, up towards the PASS OF CARADHRAS.
Legolas the Elf moves lightly across the top of the snow...he suddenly pauses.
Saruman's voice sweeps by in the wind.
LEGOLAS There is a fell voice in the air.
GANDALF It's Saruman.
THUNDER RUMBLES...ROCK and Shale fall from above.
ARAGORN He's trying to bring down the mountain.
ARAGORN Gandalf!
ARAGORN We must turn back!
GANDALF No!
GANDALF Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho I ruith.
GANDALF Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath.
CAMERA SWEEPS PAST SARUMAN...he stands on the summit of Orthanc, Chanting.
CLOUDS ARE FLOWING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS...
converging on the distant mountains in a stormy Malestrom.
Saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship like thunder.
A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside above them.
Frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche thunders down towards them!
The Fellowship throw themselves against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge.
LEGOLAS pulls Gandalf to safety.
Aragorn shields Frodo and Sam as snow piles around them.
Within moments, the pass is blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow.
Boromir and Aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits...who are pulled out Shivering and Fearful.
BOROMIR We must get off the mountain!
BOROMIR Make for the gap of Rohan and take the West road to my city.
ARAGORN The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard.
GIMLI We cannot pass over the mountain.
GIMLI Let us go under it.
GIMLI Let us go through the mines of Moria.
GIMLI Gandalf has a concerned look on his face.
SARUMAN (V.O.) Moria.
SARUMAN (V.O.) You fear to go into those mines, don't you?
SARUMAN (V.O.) The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.
SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) You know what they awoke in, the darkness of Khazad-dum.
SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Shadow and flame.
GANDALF Let the ringbearer decide.
CLOSE ON: FRODO, the weight of the decision weighing heavily upon him.
CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN shivering in Boromir's arms.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Frodo?
Frodo meets Gandalf's eye.
FRODO We will go through the mines.
FRODO Gandalf slowly nods.
GANDALF So be it.
The Fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark lake...directly below great looming cliffs.
GIMLI The walls of Moria!
Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and greasy stones.
Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between the trees...
slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone.
GANDALF Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and moonlight.
A large moon rises over the mountains...
The lines grow Broader and Clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and symbols.
GANDALF (CONT'D) It reads, "The door of Durin, Lord of Moria.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Speak, friend, and enter."
MERRY What do you suppose that means?
GANDALF It's quite simple.
GANDALF If you are a friend, speak the password and the doors will open.
Gandalf raises his arms...
GANDALF (CONT'D) Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!
The cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, Frodo shivers...
and the door stands fast!
Mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door.
Sam packs pots and pans at his feet...watching sadly as Aragorn un- saddles Bill the pony.
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN whispering to Bill the Pony.
ARAGORN Mines are no place for a Pony, even one so brave as Bill.
SAM Bye, Bill.
ARAGORN Go on, Bill, go on..don't worry, Sam...he knows his way home.
ARAGORN Aragorn slaps Bill on the rump...Bill goes trotting off.
ARAGORN CLOSE ON: Sam watching Bill disappear into the darkness.
SAM Goodbye, Bill.
SPLASH!
Merry and Pippin are tossing stones into the lake.
Black Rippling rings slowly fan out.
Pippin is about to throw another stone, but Aragorn grabs his arm.
ARAGORN Do not disturb the water.
Aragorn watches anxiously as the Ripples appear to grow....he exchanges a look with Boromir.
Aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword.
Gandalf gives up in despair...he sits down beside Frodo.
Close on: Frodo peers at the Elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of comprehension.
FRODO It's a riddle...
Gandalf raises his eyebrows...
FRODO (CONT'D) Speak, friend, and enter.
FRODO (CONT'D) What's the Elvish for friend?
GANDALF Oh...mellon.
With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and two great Doors swing outwards...
revealing a blackness deeper than the night.
As the Fellowship enter the Blackness, something in the water stirs....
The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain.
GIMLI So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves; roaring fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
GIMLI This, my friend, is the home of my cousin, Balin...and they call this a Mine...
GIMLI A mine!
A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights the chamber...
The Fellowship recoil in Horror!
Many dwarf Skeletons are strewn about, clearly the dead of some old battle...the rusting armor and shields are peppered with arrows and axes.
BOROMIR This is no mine...it's a tomb!
GIMLI Oh...no...no..no...
GIMLI Legolas pulls a crude arrow out of a skeleton.
LEGOLAS Goblins!
The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the Entrance.
BOROMIR We make for the Gap of Rohan.
BOROMIR We should never have come here.
Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND.
A long sinuous Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him towards the lake.
FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush forward!
Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs.
20 more tentacles ripple out of the Lake!
The dark water Boils as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP!
Again the creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature.
Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into Boromir's arms.
GANDALF Into the mines!
BOROMIR Legolas!
Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of the water with Frodo.
The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from the Creature...
retreating into the Moria Chamber as many Coiling arms seize the large doors.
With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face.
Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway...
throwing the Fellowship into Pitch Blackness.
A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy Glow across the old wizards face.
GANDALF We now have but one choice...we must face the long dark of Moria.
GANDALF Be on your guard...there are older and fouler things than the Orcs in the deep places of the world.
WIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above deep mine workings.
GANDALF Quietly, now.
GANDALF It's a four day journey to the other side.
GANDALF Let us hope that our presence will go unnoticed.
They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf cemetery.
The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in dried Dwarf blood.
The Atmosphere is very sinister.
The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into dark tunnels.
Gandalf pauses, frowning.
GANDALF I have no memory of this place.
LATER...
The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him.
He appears to be in some kind of trance.
He turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind them.
PIPPIN Are we lost?
MERRY No.
MERRY I don't think we are.
MERRY Shhhh, Gandalf's thinking.
PIPPIN Merry!
MERRY What?
PIPPIN I'm hungry.
Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness.
Frodo is nervous...he approaches Gandalf.
FRO DO There's something down there.
GANDALF It's Gollum.
FRODO Gollum!
GANDALF He's been following us for three days.
TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.
FRODO He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?
GANDALF Escaped...or was set loose.
GANDALF And now the Ring has drawn him here...he will never be rid of his need for it.
GANDALF He hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himself.
GANDALF Smeagol's life is a sad story.
GANDALF Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before the ring came to him, before it drove him mad.
Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice.
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
Pity?
It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.
Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life.
Can you give it to them, Frodo?
Frodo frowns.
Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment...even the very wise cannot see all ends.
My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before this is over.
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.
I wish the ring had never come to me...I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide.
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.
There is a note of finality in Gandalf's voice.
There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.
In which case, you also were meant to have it...and that is an encouraging thought,
Ah!
That it's that way!
Gandalf points at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship scramble to their feet.
He's remembered!
No, but the air doesn't smell so foul down there.
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose!
Ye s...
The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and empty space.
Gandalf pauses...
GALADRIEL Let me risk a little more light.
GALADRIEL Gandalf taps his staff...for a brief moment a light
blazes...
like a silent Flash of Lightning.
Great shadows spring up and flee...
GANDALF Behold!
GANDALF The great realm and Dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf!
GANDALF Frodo gasps at the brief sight of a vast roof, far above
their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls, polished and smooth as glass.
SAM Well, there's an eye opener and no mistake!
Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed.
Black arrows are embedded in the timbers.
Two goblin skeletons lie in the doorway.
Gimli rushes ahead...
GANDALF Gimli!!
Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber...
lit with a narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near the roof.
Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high.
In the far corner sits a stone walled Well.
A shaft of light falls directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great slab of white stone.
Gimli falls to his knees...
GIMLI No...no...oh, no!
Gimli sobs.
Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto the white stone slab.
GANDALF "Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of Moria."
GANDALF He is dead, then.
GANDALF It's as I had feared.
Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from the white stone slab.
It has been slashed and stabbed...and appears to be covered in Dried Blood.
The pages crack and break as he opens it...
LEGOLAS We must move on, we cannot linger.
GANDALF "They have taken the Bridge and the second hall: we have barred the gates...but cannot hold them for long...the ground shakes...drums in the deep...we cannot get out.
GANDALF A shadow moves in the dark.
GANDALF Will no- one save us?
GANDALF They are coming."
Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton tumbling in!
Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin before he falls.
The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing loudly!
Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.
GANDALF Fool of a Took!
GANDALF Throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity!
They fall silent.
A low rolling boom rises from the depths below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of Moria were turned into a vast drum.
A great horn blasts nearby...Answering horns ...
running feet...harsh cries...
Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...
SAM Mr. Frodo!
Frodo looks down.
A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's Scabbard!
Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing blade!
LEGOLAS Orcs !
ARAGORN Get back!
ARAGORN Stay close to Gandalf.
Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors.
Boromir catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in his eyes.
BOROMIR They have a cave troll!
Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb.
GIMLI Let them come!
GIMLI There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath!
BOOM!
The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll!
Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in 2 Goblin helmets.
Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of Goblins with their swords.
Legolas fires deadly arrows into Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle!
The cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles backwards...the huge club descends for the killing blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back, spewing green blood!
Sam is backing up against a wall...a sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other.
In desperation he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan!
It keels over...Sam looks surprised.
He wallops another Goblin and it too, drops.
SAM I think I'm getting the hang of this.
The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest with his spear.
FRODO Aragorn!
FRODO Aragorn!
Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and slammed against the wall.
ARAGORN Frodo!!
The hobbits go crazy.
Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee, bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead.
Aragorn rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo appears to be dead.
Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits looking horrified...
Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge breath.
SAM He's alive!
FRODO I'm alright.
FRODO I'm not hurt.
ARAGORN You should be dead.
ARAGORN That spear would've skewered a wild boar!
GANDALF I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye.
Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.
The Troll Spear did not pierce the mithril."
GIMLI Mithril!
GIMLI You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.
BOOM.
BOOM.
BOOM the sound of the drums rings out again!
Gandalf turns to the others.
GANDALF To the bridge of Khazad-dum!
Gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge Dwarrowdelf Chamber.
GANDALF This way!
They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches!
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army that's rushing toward them!
SUDDENLY!
A deafening roar fills the air!
A fiery light dances down the hallway...
the pillars casting eerie shadows.
The Goblins freeze.
They back Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the darkness.
BOROMIR What is this new devilry?
A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...
GANDALF A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!
GANDALF This foe is beyond any of you!
GANDALF Run!
GANDALF Quickly!
The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great 40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames!
In one hand is a blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP of many thongs.
Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his staff.
Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.
GANDALF Lead them on, Aragorn.
GANDALF The bridge is near.
Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Do as I say; swords are no more use here.
THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm.
A NARROW BRIDGE, spanning a bottomless pit...Gandalf yells to the others: Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.
GIMLI Nobody tosses a dwarf!
GIMLI The BALROG smashes through the wall and spreads its vast wings.
GIMLI (CONT'D) It swoops down past the Fellowship, disappearing into a flaming pit!
The Fellowship run into a hall...the floor is split with fissures that spit flame.
GANDALF Over the bridge!
GANDALF Fly!
They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb or rail...at the far end of the hall.
The Fellowship recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf...
the last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other!
Frodo looks back in horror:
GANDALF (CONT'D) You cannot pass!
FRODO Gandalf!
GANDALF I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
GANDALF The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.
Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.
Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Go back to the shadow!
GANDALF (CONT'D) The BALROG slashes at Gandalf with its Sword of
flame...Gandalf blocks with his sword...a ringing clash and the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!
GANDALF (CONT'D) You shall not pass!!
GANDALF (CONT'D) The Balrog places one foot onto the bridge.
GANDALF (CONT'D) Aragorn and Boromir race forward, swords drawn.
GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons up his LAST RESERVES OF
He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of white flame springs up...
the staff shatters...the bridge breaks...
right at Balrog's feet.
The stone bridge drops away into the gulf...from under the Balrog.
For a moment, the great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down: in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains trembling on the lip of the broken bridge.
Slow motion: As the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire...
Slow motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's knees, dragging him over the brink!
Gandalf just manages to hand on by his fingertips
FRODO Gandalf!
GANDALF Fly, you fools!
CLOSE ON: Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away...
following the Balrog into the bottomless Abyss!
Frodo cries out!
Boromir scoops him up and carries him away.
FRODO No!
ARAGORN Gandalf!
They rush towards an archway.
The Fellowship tumble out of the Great Eastern Gate on to a grassy sunlit hillside.
Sam, Merry, and Pippin fall slowly to the ground, Sobbing...Aragorn turns to Legolas and Gimli.
ARAGORN Legolas, get them up!
BOROMIR Give them a moment...for pity's sake!
ARAGORN By nightfall these hills will be swarming with Orcs!
ARAGORN We must reach the woods of Lothlorien.
ARAGORN Come, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, get them up.
ARAGORN On your feet, Sam.
ARAGORN (CONT'D) Boromir glances towards Frodo, then back at Aragorn.
ARAGORN (CONT'D) Frodo is walking away, as if in a daze.
ARAGORN (CONT'D) Frodo?
ARAGORN (CONT'D) Frodo!
CLOSE ON: FRODO SLOWLY TURNS...a look of numb shock on his devastated face.
The Fellowship marches on.
Aragorn scours ahead of the company, as they stumble on in the fading light...in the distance the shimmer of a large forest can be seen...Lothlorien!
WIDE ON: The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by silver pillars...the trunks of huge, grey trees.
Gimli looks nervously around...
GIMLI Stay close, young hobbits..they say a Sorceress lives in these woods.
GIMLI An elf- witch of terrible power.
GIMLI All who look upon her fall under her spell...
Frodo hesitates...a STRANGE VOICE whispers in his head...
GALADRIEL (V.O.) Frodo...
GIMLI And are never seen again!
GALADRIEL (V.O.) ...your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.
GALADRIEL (V.O.) You bring great evil here, Ringbearer.
SAM Mr. Frodo?
GIMLI Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.
GIMLI I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox!
The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES.
Deadly arrows aimed at their heads.
HALDIR, the Elvish captain steps forward...
he looks at Gimli with disdain.
HALDIR The dwarf breathes so loud we could have shot him in the dark.
ARAGORN Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your help.
ARAGORN We need your protection.
GIMLI Aragorn!
GIMLI These woods are perilous.
GIMLI We should go back.
HALDIR You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood.
HALDIR You cannot go back.
Haldir's eyes lock onto Frodo.
HALDIR (CONT'D) Come, she is waiting.
Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top.
They look with wonderment at the vista spread before them.
Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of the woods.
Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees, taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a Beautiful City.
It Gleams in the low rays of the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver.
To the east of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale gleam of Anduin, the great river.
Beyond the River, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away, it rises again like a dark and dreary wall.
The Sun that lies on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond.
ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light.
The walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its crown.
Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests.
His hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age upon it.
Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady of the Elves.
She has hair of deep gold and timeless, unsurpassed beauty.
Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...
CELEBORN Eight there are, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell.
CELEBORN Tell me, where is Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with him.
Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn.
GALADRIEL (V.O.) ...he has fallen into shadow.
GALADRIEL (V.O.) Galadriel looks to Aragorn.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) The Quest stands upon the edge of a knife.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope remains while the company is true.
Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) Do not let your hearts be troubled.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) Galadriel's eyes turn to Frodo...her voice fades.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) Tonight you will sleep in peace.
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...
CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at GALADRIEL.
SUDDEN INSERT: GALADRIEL as she is on the other
side...
Powerful, divine...no longer of this world..a Piercing white light surrounds her.
GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...one who has seen the eye.
Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain.
They lie on soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them.
MOURNFUL SINGING drifts down from the trees above.
LEGOLAS A lament for Gandalf...
MERRY What do they say about him?
LEGOLAS I have not the heart to tell you.
LEGOLAS For me, the grief is still too near.
LEGOLAS Boromir is sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.
ARAGORN Take some rest..these borders are well protected.
Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face.
Aragorn kneels down beside him.
BOROMIR I will find no rest here.
BOROMIR I heard her voice inside my head...she spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor, and she said to me: "Even now, there
BOROMIR (CONT'D) is hope left.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) But I cannot see it...it is long since we had any hope.
CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing and our..our people lose faith.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) He looks to me to make things right...and I would do it, I would see the glory of Gondor restored.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?
BOROMIR (CONT'D) The White Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, its banners caught high in the morning breeze...have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?
ARAGORN I have seen the white city..long ago.
Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes heart,
BOROMIR One day our paths will lead us there, and the tower guards shall take up the call "the Lords of Gondor have returned."
Aragorn returns Boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet sadness only when Boromir looks away.
The Fellowship are asleep on their beds.
Gimli is snoring loudly.
CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the lawn.
CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by instinct.
GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him.
Frodo follows her...as if drawn by an invisible force.
Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a shallow Silver Basin.
Galadriel leads Frodo into the small Glade.
GALADRIEL Will you look into the mirror?
GALADRIEL Frodo looks with apprehension at the silver basin.
FRODO What will I see?
Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a glow rises from the water.
GALADRIEL Even the wisest cannot tell for the mirror shows many things...things that were ..things that are...and some things that have not yet come to pass.
Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers into the glossy surface.
The night sky is reflected into the water...
suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure of an old man, clad in white robes.
He walks down a long road.
Frodo leans closer to the mirror's surface...
FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.
FRODO Gandalf!
Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity.
Frodo reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.
Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white.
The vision shifts...Frodo gasps in horror!
The Shire is in ruins!
The image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames!
The Party tree is hacked down.
Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely.
IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland!
The fields and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching smoke!
IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the Factories!
We see Sam...Merry...
and Rosie Cotton.
Soot- stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell- hole!
Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black abyss a single eye grows.
CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN.
Unable to move or cry out.
The ring dangles from his neck, inches above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam.
Fire erupts around the eye...
With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground.
Light instantly fades from the mirror.
Frodo comes to his senses...he is shocked.
Galadriel stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched by the horror.
GALADRIEL I know what it is you saw...for it is also in my mind.
GALADRIEL It is the future, Frodo.
GALADRIEL It is what will come to pass if you should fail.
Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in his hand he is clutching the ring.
Frodo looks up at Galadriel.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) The fellowship is breaking.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) It has already begun.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) He will try to take the ring.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) You know of whom I speak.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) One by one, it will destroy them all.
FRODO (V.O.) If you ask it of me, I will give you the One Ring.
GALADRIEL You offer it to me freely...I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.
Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's eyes.
Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) In place of the Dark Lord, you would have a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Dawn.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) Treacherous as the Sea!
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) Stronger than the foundations of the earth...all shall love me and despair!
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) Frodo takes a step away from Galadriel...
Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) I pass the test.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) I will diminish and go into the west and remain Galadriel.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) Frodo's confidence drains away.
FRODO I cannot do this alone...
GALADRIEL You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear a ring of power is to be alone.
GALADRIEL This task was appointed to you, and if you do not find a way, no one will.
Frodo realizes what her message is.
FRODO Then I know what I must do.
FRODO It's just...I'm afraid to do it.
FRODO Galadriel kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at him intently.
GALADRIEL Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close over it.
Naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean intelligence.
SARUMAN (V.O.) They were Elves once.
SARUMAN (V.O.) Taken by the Dark Powers ...
SARUMAN (V.O.) tortured and mutilated...a ruined and terrible form of life.
SARUMAN (V.O.) And now...perfected.
SARUMAN (V.O.) My fighting Uruk-Hai.
SARUMAN (V.O.) Whom do you serve?
LURTZ Saruman.
QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored...Breastplate...Leg guards, Helmet...a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand.
The URUK- HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared on bodies, faces, and armor.
SARUMAN address a crowd of 200 fully armed URUK-HAI.
SARUMAN Hunt them down.
SARUMAN Do not stop until they are found.
SARUMAN You do not know pain.
SARUMAN You do not know fear.
SARUMAN You will taste man-flesh.
SARUMAN Saruman turns to Lurtz.
SARUMAN (CONT'D) One of the Halflings carries something of great value...bring him to me...alive and unspoiled...kill the others.
Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast, their powerful legs carrying them at speed.
The Fellowship are in small elven boats.
They row away from the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river.
Elves quietly watch them depart.
Galadriel gives Frodo a small Crystal Phial.
GALADRIEL Farewell, Frodo Baggins.
GALADRIEL I give you the light of Earendil, our most beloved star.
As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone, watching from the banks of the river.
In his head, Frodo still hears her voice...
GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D) May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.
The boats pass into the great river Anduin.
The Three Elven boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward.
Green trees slowly give way to a brown and withered land.
The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly purpose.
A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale sky.
Aragorn watches them with concern.
The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge in the Pre-dawn light.
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly paddling in the stern.
ARAGORN Frodo.
Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement.
Wide on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of Gondorian kings of old.
They loom over the boats with power and majesty.
ARAGORN (CONT'D) The Argonath...
Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels.
He speaks, almost as if to himself.
ARAGORN (CONT'D) Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old...my kin.
The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.
Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to reveal a large lake only a mile down river...
As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded shore.
ARAGORN We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the boats and continue on foot..we approach Mordor from the North.
GIMLI Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks.
GIMLI And after that gets even better...a festering, stinking marshland, far as the eye can see.
ARAGORN That is our Road...I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.
GIMLI Recover my...
Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.
LEGOLAS We should leave now.
ARAGORN No.
ARAGORN Orcs patrol the Eastern shore.
ARAGORN We must wait for cover of darkness.
LEGOLAS It is not the Eastern shore that worries me.
Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...
LEGOLAS (CONT'D) A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.
LEGOLAS (CONT'D) Something draws near, I can feel it.
Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means.
Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling at Gimli's feet...
MERRY Where's Frodo?
Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp bed.
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN....
as he realizes Boromir has gone!
Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought.
His feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat.
A CRACKLING SOUND!
Frodo freezes....
BOROMIR None of us should wander alone; you least of all.
BOROMIR So much depends on you...Frodo?
Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) I know why you seek solitude.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) You suffer, I see it day by day.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Are you sure you do not suffer needlessly?
Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be heard
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Let me help you.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) There are other ways, Frodo..other paths that we might take.
FRODO I know what you would say, and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.
BOROMIR Warning?
BOROMIR Against what?
Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself up.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) We are all afraid, Frodo.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) But to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have...don't you see that is madness?
FRODO There is no other way.
BOROMIR I ask only for the strength to defend my people.
BOROMIR If you would but lend me the ring...
FRODO No.
Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.
BOROMIR Why do you recoil?
BOROMIR I am no thief.
FRODO You are not yourself.
BOROMIR What chance do you think you have?
BOROMIR They will find you, they will take the ring and you will beg for death before the end.
Frodo turns to leave.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) You fool!
BOROMIR (CONT'D) It is not yours save by unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) It should be mine.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Give it to me!
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Give me the ring.
Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring!
Frodo has only moments to act.
Frodo rips the ring from around his neck..and rams it on his finger.
FRODO DISAPPEARS Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into thin air!
BOROMIR I see your mind...you will take the ring to Sauron.
BOROMIR You will betray us!
BOROMIR You go to your death and the death of us all.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Curse you!
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Curse you and your Halflings!
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Boromir stumbles and falls.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) His body shakes as if in the Throes of a fit...slowly he comes to.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Frodo!
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Frodo!
BOROMIR (CONT'D) What have I done.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Please, Frodo...
FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy shapes of twisted trees.
Somewhere behind him, Boromir's distraught voice carries from another dimension:
BOROMIR I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...
Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone pillars.
Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the throne of mountain kings.
The world of mist swirls around him.
Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to shrink.
In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope towards him through the mist.
IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of holes in the misty mountains...
flames rising from Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships sailing into the south.
All the power of the Dark Lord is in motion.
Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills Frodo's vision.
A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong, tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!
They will fall!
Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down the stairs!
The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight, seeking its ring!
With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring off his finger...
Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the ancient ruins of the seeing seat.
Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.
ARAGORN Frodo?
FRODO It has taken Boromir.
FRODO ARAGORN moves towards Frodo...
ARAGORN Where is the ring?
Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the movement.
FRODO Stay away!
ARAGORN Frodo...I swore to protect you.
FRODO Can you protect me from yourself?
Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring!
It glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's eyes are drawn to it.
FRODO (CONT'D) Would you destroy it?
ARAGORN I would have gone with you to the end...
ARAGORN into the very fires of Mordor.
FRODO I know...Look after the others, especially Sam...he will not understand.
Aragorn freezes!
He draws his sword.
ARAGORN Go, Frodo!
Frodo hesitates.
ARAGORN (CONT'D) Run!
ARAGORN (CONT'D) Run!!
Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto Amon Hen behind Aragorn!
Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman...
he brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as others close in on him.
Frodo scrambles down the hillside, away from the fight.
Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen.
Despite his bravery, he is quickly surrounded...
SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into the URUK-HAI.
Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.
Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet thunder down behind him.
SAM Mr. Frodo!
Sam looks around for Frodo.
CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his
LURTZ Find the Halflings ...
LURTZ find the halflings!
Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the forest rings out.
MERRY Frodo!
Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few feet away.
MERRY (CONT'D) Hide here, quick!
PIPPIN Come on...
Frodo looks at his friends...
slowly shakes his head, a great sadness in his eyes...
PIPPIN (CONT'D) What's he doing?
Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.
Understanding.
MERRY He's leaving.
PIPPIN No!
Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at his arm.
MERRY Pippin!
THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards the lake.
LEGOLAS The horn of Gondor!
ARAGORN Boromir!
Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear guard action.
MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he tries to protect Merry and Pippin...
BOROMIR Run!
BOROMIR Run!
Lurtz takes aim.
A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's chest.
Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another arrow...and another, brings him to his knees.
Merry and Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.
MERRY & PIPPIN Aaaaagh!
MERRY & PIPPIN Boromir!
MERRY & PIPPIN Boromir!
Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart...
suddenly Aragorn charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword.
They lock into a deadly battle.
Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI arrows sticking out of his chest.
At least 20 dead URUK-HAI lie heaped around Boromir.
His horn lies at his feet...Cloven in two.
BOROMIR They took the little ones...
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow of Blood from Boromir's shoulder.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Frodo...where is Frodo?
ARAGORN I let Frodo go.
Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.
BOROMIR Then you did what I could not.
BOROMIR I tried to take the ring from him.
ARAGORN The ring is beyond our reach now.
BOROMIR Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed you all.
ARAGORN No, Boromir.
ARAGORN You fought bravely.
ARAGORN You have kept your honor.
ARAGORN Aragorn tries to bind Boromir's wound.
BOROMIR Leave it!
BOROMIR It is over...the world of Men will fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin..Aragorn..
ARAGORN I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you...
ARAGORN I will not let the White City fall, nor your people fail...
BOROMIR Our people...our people...
Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.
Boromir's fingers tighten around the hilt.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) I would have followed you, my brother...my captain, my King.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Aragorn lays Boromir down.
BOROMIR (CONT'D) He is dead.
ARAGORN Be at peace, son of Gondor.
ARAGORN Aragorn bends and Kisses Boromir's forehead.
ARAGORN (CONT'D) Legolas and Gimli appear behind him...Aragorn stands.
ARAGORN (CONT'D) They will look for his coming from the white tower...but he will not return.
On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish Boats, the ring in his palm.
A distraught Sam...running as hard as he can through the forest...
SAM Mr. Frodo!
Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the camera moves in on the ring.
FRODO (V.O.) I wish the ring had never come to me..I wish none of this had happened...
Tears fall down Frodo's face...
GANDALF (V.O.) So do all who lie to see such times...but that is not for them to decide.
GANDALF (V.O.) All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his vest pocket.
The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish boat into the water...
Sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.
SAM Not alone, Frodo.
SAM Mr. Frodo!
SAM Frodo, in the boat, paddling steadfastly away from the
shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on the wind.
Frodo whispers to himself
FRODO No, Sam.
Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.
SPLASH!
FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the water.
FRODO (CONT'D) Go back,Sam.
FRODO (CONT'D) I'm going to Mordor alone.
Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.
SAM Of course you are...and I'm coming with you!
FRODO You can't swim.
Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...
FRODO (CONT'D) Sam!
Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's...
Frodo pulls a bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat.
Frodo and Sam look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming down both their faces.
SAM I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.
SAM "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
SAM And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.
FRODO Oh, Sam!
Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends hug.
FRODO (CONT'D) Come on then..
The two Hobbits row through the water...
Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing water...Boromir's body slides under camera.
He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his chest..his broken horn at his side.
Suddenly...
the boat drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.
LEGOLAS If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and Sam before nightfall.
Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and Sam make off into the forest beyond.
He doesn't react.
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.
LEGOLAS (CONT'D) You mean not to follow them...
ARAGORN Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.
GIMLI Then it has all been in vain...the fellowship has failed.
ARAGORN Not if we hold true to each other.
ARAGORN We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death, not while we have strength left.
Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it on.
ARAGORN (CONT'D) Leave all that can be spared behind...
ARAGORN (CONT'D) CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his eye.
ARAGORN (CONT'D) We travel light.
ARAGORN (CONT'D) Let's hunt some Orc.
GIMLI Yes!
GIMLI Ha!
Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods, following the URUK-HAI trail.
Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.
A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark, oppressive sky.
Black volcanic smoke rises behind the mountains....MORDOR!
FRODO Mordor!
FRODO I hope the others find a safer road.
SAM Strider'll look after them.
FRODO I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.
SAM We may yet, Mr. Frodo.
SAM We may.
FRODO Sam?
Frodo looks at Sam with great affection..despite the grim outlook, Sam is undeterred...
FRODO (CONT'D) I'm glad you're with me.
