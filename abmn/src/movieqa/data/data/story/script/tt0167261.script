Elvish dialogue from The Elvish Linguistic
Fellowship.
[Camera pans over the Misty Mountains as voices drift in from the background.]
GANDALF You cannot pass!
FRODO Gandalf!
GANDALF I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor!
[Camera pans closer to the mountain side.]
GANDALF Argh!
GANDALF Go back to the shadow.
GANDALF The Dark Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udun!
GANDALF [Camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-dum.
GANDALF The Balrog strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming sword.
GANDALF Gandalf parries the blow with Glamdring, shattering the Balrog?s sword.]
[Gandalf strikes his staff onto the bridge.
As the Balrog steps forward, the bridge collapses from under it and the demon plunges backward into the chasm.
Gandalf, exhausted, leans on his staff and watches the Balrog fall then turns to follow the others.
At the last minute, the flaming whip lashes up from the depths of the abyss and winds around Gandalf?s ankle, dragging him over the edge.
He clings onto the bridge but is straining to keep his grip.]
GANDALF Argh!
[Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains him.]
No!
No!
FRODO Gandalf!
GANDALF Fly, you fools!
[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm]
FRODO Noooooooooooooooo!!!!
[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm]
FRODO [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
[Gandalf falls after the Balrog and grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on his way down.
As they continue to plunge into the depths, Gandalf hacks away at the Balrog even as it thrashes and bounces off the walls.
They continue to plunge at great speed, sometimes with Gandalf clinging to the horn of the demon.
The battling pair then falls into an enormous cavern and plunges into the water.
Just then Frodo awakens as if from a nightmare.]
FRODO Gandalf!
SAM What is it, Mr. Frodo?
FRODO Nothing.
FRODO Just a dream.
FRODO [Lies back down.]
[Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky terrain Emyn Muil.
They look into the distance at the Mountain of Fire.]
SAM Mordor.
SAM The one place in Middle-earth we don?t want to see any closer, and the one place we?re trying to get to.
SAM It?s just where we can?t get.
SAM Let?s face it, Mr. Frodo, we?re lost.
SAM I don?t think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
FRODO He didn?t mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...
FRODO but they did.
[Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eye zooming in on him.
He gasps and pants as he backs away.]
SAM Mr. Frodo?
SAM It?s the Ring, isn?t it?
FRODO It?s getting heavier.
FRODO [Clutches the Ring by his chest and sits down, still panting.
FRODO He then fumbles for his water bottle and takes a sip.]
FRODO What food have we got left?
SAM Well, let me see.
SAM [He takes out a package of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, lovely ? Lembas bread.
SAM And look!
SAM [He digs deeper into his pack] More lembas bread.
[Sam shows another package.
He then breaks off a piece and tosses it to Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]
SAM I don't usually hold with foreign food, but this Elvish stuff, it?s not bad.
FRODO [smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?
[Sam smiles back, and then looks ominously towards Mordor.]
SAM Those rain clouds might.
[They continue trekking through difficult terrain, often huddling underneath their cloaks.]
SAM [Looks around] This looks strangely familiar.
FRODO [Exasperated] It?s because we?ve been here before!
FRODO We?re going in circles.
SAM Ah!
SAM What's that 'orrid stink?
SAM I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
SAM Can you smell it?
FRODO Yes.
FRODO I can smell it.
FRODO [Drops to a whisper] We?re not alone.
Frodo and Sam are sleeping.
A dark shape appears on top of the cliff.
The creature Gollum has appeared and is making his way down to the hobbits.]
GOLLUM The thieves!
GOLLUM The thieves!
GOLLUM The filthy little thieves!
GOLLUM Where is it?
GOLLUM Where isss it?
GOLLUM They stole it from us.
GOLLUM My preciousss.
GOLLUM [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse them!
GOLLUM We hates them!
GOLLUM It?s ours, it is...
GOLLUM and we wantssss it!
[Gollum reaches out his hand towards the hobbits.
Suddenly the hobbits spring up, grab hold of Gollum?s arms and pull him down.
Amidst the struggle, Gollum wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo.
As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring around his neck is revealed and Gollum jumps straight for the Ring.
Sam tries to grab at him but is knocked away.
Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and tries to reach for the Ring even as Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push him away.
Gollum?s cheeks puff with exertion as he struggles with Frodo, his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring.
Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears him away from Frodo.
Gollum then turns around and bites Sam on the shoulder, wriggles around and clasps his arms around Sam?s neck and legs around his waist in a death grip.
Frodo unsheathes Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]
FRODO [menacingly] This is Sting.
FRODO You?ve seen it before, haven?t you...
FRODO Gollum!
FRODO Release him or I?ll cut your throat!
[Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on Sam and as the latter disentangles himself, Gollum wails.
In the next scene, Gollum is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope around his neck, wailing and writhing in pain.]
GOLLUM It burns!
GOLLUM It burns us!
GOLLUM It freezes!
GOLLUM Nasty Elves twisted it.
GOLLUM Take it off us!
SAM Quiet you!
[Sam tugs fiercely at the rope.
Gollum cries some more and collapses onto his back.
Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
SAM It?s hopeless!
SAM Every Orc in Mordor?s going to hear this racket!
SAM Let?s just tie him up and leave him.
GOLLUM No!
GOLLUM That would kill us!
GOLLUM Kill us!
SAM It?s no more than you deserve!
FRODO Maybe he does deserve to die, but now that I see him, I do pity him.
GOLLUM [Begging] We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
GOLLUM Take it off us.
GOLLUM We swears to do what you wants.
GOLLUM We swears.
FRODO There?s no promise you can make that I can trust.
GOLLUM We swears to serve the master of the preciousss.
GOLLUM We swears on...
GOLLUM on the precious.
GOLLUM *Gollum.
GOLLUM Gollum.*
FRODO The Ring is treacherous.
FRODO It will hold you to your word.
GOLLUM Yes...
GOLLUM on the preciousss.
GOLLUM On the preciousss.
SAM I don?t believe you!
SAM [Gollum backs away, frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] Get down!
SAM I said, down!
[Sam jerks strongly at the rope as Gollum tries to get away from him.
He crashes onto the ground, choking.]
FRODO Sam!
SAM He?s trying to trick us!
SAM We let him go he?ll throttle us in our sleep!
[Gollum lies panting and holding his throat.
He backs away, frightened, as Frodo approaches him.]
FRODO You know the way to Mordor?
GOLLUM [nods warily] Yes...
FRODO You?ve been there before?
GOLLUM [nods again] Yes...
[Frodo reaches out and takes the rope noose off Gollum?s neck.
Gollum seems surprised and relieved.]
FRODO You will lead us to the Black Gate.
FRODO [A band of Uruk-hai marches across the plain, with two hobbits bound to the backs of two Uruk-hai.
FRODO Pippin tries to call to Merry, who is unconscious with a gash on his right brow.]
PIPPIN Merry.
PIPPIN Merry!
PIPPIN [He receives no response.]
[Suddenly, an Uruk-hai puts up his hand and signals a stop.]
UGLUK What is it?
UGLUK What do you smell?
[sniffs the air] Man-flesh.
PIPPIN [quietly to himself] Aragorn!
UGLUK They've picked up our trail!
UGLUK Let's move!
UGLUK [Aragorn is lying with his eyes closed and ear pressed to the ground, listening for the sound of footsteps.]
ARAGORN Their pace has quickened.
ARAGORN [He looks up.] They must have caught our scent.
ARAGORN Hurry!
ARAGORN [He runs off.]
LEGOLAS Come on, Gimli!
LEGOLAS [Looks back at Gimli and then runs after Aragorn]
GIMLI [pauses in his steps and huffs] Three days? and nights? pursuit.
GIMLI No food.
GIMLI No rest.
GIMLI And no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell.
GIMLI [Runs after his companions.]
[The Three Hunters run across rocks and plains, with Aragorn in the lead, followed by Legolas and Gimli.
From time to time, Legolas looks back to make sure that Gimli is keeping up.
Aragorn suddenly bends down to pick up an Elven brooch from the ground.]
ARAGORN Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
LEGOLAS [stops and turns to Aragorn.] They may yet be alive.
ARAGORN Less than a day ahead of us.
ARAGORN Come!
ARAGORN [Runs off again]
[Gimli stumbles from behind some rocks and rolls to the ground]
LEGOLAS Come, Gimli!
LEGOLAS We are gaining on them!
GIMLI [Panting] I am wasted on cross-country!
GIMLI We dwarves are natural sprinters!
GIMLI Very dangerous over short distances!
[The trackers come over a hill and pause as they gaze across the plains below.]
ARAGORN Rohan.
ARAGORN Home of the horse-lords.
ARAGORN There is something strange at work here.
ARAGORN Some evil gives speed to these creatures, sets its will against us.
[Legolas runs ahead and looks out to the horizon.]
ARAGORN Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?
LEGOLAS The Uruks turn northeast.
LEGOLAS They?re taking the hobbits to Isengard!
ARAGORN Saruman.
[The tower of Orthanc stands amidst the smoking caverns of Isengard.
Saruman stands in his chamber, communicating with the Dark Lord through the Palantir.]
SARUMAN (V.O.) The world is changing.
SARUMAN (V.O.) [View changes to the tower of Barad-dur, with its huge Orc armies on a bridge.] Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
SARUMAN (V.O.) To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
[Camera pans upwards along the height of the tower of Barad-dur until the flaming Eye is in view.]
SARUMAN (V.O.) Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-earth.
[The trees around Isengard are being ripped down, chopped up and used to feed huge furnaces.
The caverns of Isengard glow with the fires of industry, sounds of hammering fill the air and molten iron is poured into casts to forge weapons.]
SARUMAN (V.O.) The old world will burn in the fires of industry.
SARUMAN (V.O.) The forests will fall.
SARUMAN (V.O.) A new order will rise.
SARUMAN (V.O.) We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
SARUMAN (V.O.) We have only to remove those who oppose us.
[Saruman stands in the midst of a gathering of Dunlanders.]
SARUMAN The horsemen took your land.
SARUMAN They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
SARUMAN Take back the lands they stole from you!
SARUMAN Burn every village!
[Roars with approval] Argh!!
[They stomp off to destroy the villages of Rohan as Saruman stands coldly still among the stampede.
A Rohan village is in pandemonium as people try to escape the on-coming pillage.]
SARUMAN (V.O.) It will begin in Rohan.
SARUMAN (V.O.) Too long have these peasants stood against you.
SARUMAN (V.O.) But no more.
[A woman with her hand on a horse calls out to her children.]
MORWEN Eothain!
MORWEN Eothain!
MORWEN You take your sister.
MORWEN You?ll go faster with just two.
FREDA [As Morwen puts her onto the horse in front of her brother] Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf, he is too big for him!
MORWEN Listen to me.
MORWEN You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
MORWEN Do you understand me?
Yes, Ma!
FREDA [starts to cry] I don?t wanna leave!
FREDA I don't wanna go, Mama!
MORWEN Freda, I will find you there.
[A woman screams]
MORWEN Quickly!
[The children ride off.]
MORWEN [Looks after them] Go child!
[Dunlanders and Uruk-hai enter the village, burning everything in sights as the Rohirrim scream and run in all directions.
Eothain and Freda weep as they look back from a distance.]
SARUMAN (V.O.) Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.
SARUMAN (V.O.) [Eowyn runs hastily up the stairs to the Golden Hall and enters a bedchamber.
SARUMAN (V.O.) She runs to the bed.]
EOWYN Theodred!
EOWYN [Eomer and Eowyn are speaking to Theoden-king who sits motionless on his throne, wizened, and aged beyond his years.]
EOWYN Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
EOMER He was ambushed by Orcs.
EOMER If we don?t defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
GRIMA That is a lie!
GRIMA [Appears from the shadows.] Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
THEODEN [mumbles feebly] Grima Grima [Grima leans down close to the King.]My son...?
THEODEN Grima...?
EOMER Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
EOMER Unchecked.
EOMER Unchallenged.
EOMER Killing at will.
EOMER Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman.
EOMER [He drops a helmet onto the ground, which topples over to reveal the white hand of Saruman.]
GRIMA Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind.
GRIMA Can you not see?
GRIMA Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent, your war-mongering.
EOMER War-mongering?
[Eomer grabs Grima and pins him against a pillar.]
EOMER How long is it since Saruman bought you?
EOMER What was the promised price, Grima?
EOMER When all the men are dead you will take your share of the treasure?
[Grima?s eyes flicks to right, watching Eowyn as she walks by.
Eowyn stops to stare back for a moment before departing form the hall.
Eomer jerks Grima again and clutches his hand around Grima?s jaw.]
EOMER Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps.
[Grima's eyes look to the left and relax as Eomer is suddenly pulled off Grima by his thugs.]
GRIMA You see much Eomer, Son of Eomund.
GRIMA Too much.
GRIMA [The thugs punch Eomer n the stomach] You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan.
GRIMA Under pain of death!
EOMER [Being dragged away] Argh!!
[Uruk-hai and Orcs continue to march across the plains with their hobbit captives, with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli hot on their pursuits.]
GIMLI Keep breathing!
GIMLI That?s the key!
GIMLI Breathe!
GIMLI Ho!
LEGOLAS They?ve run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
[They continue running over vast distances.
The Uruk-hai and Orcs halt at nightfall, many panting with exertion.]
MORDOR ORC We?re not going no further till we?ve had a breather!
UGLUK Get a fire going!
[As the Orcs and Uruk-hai take their rest, Pippin crawls over towards Merry.]
PIPPIN Merry!
PIPPIN Merry!
MERRY [opens his eyes] I think...
MERRY we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
[A group of Orcs chops down the trees nearby for firewood.
Low groans and rumbles start to emerge from the forest.]
PIPPIN What?s making that noise?
MERRY [looks towards the forest] It?s the trees.
PIPPIN What?
MERRY Do you remember the Old Forest?
MERRY On the borders of Buckland?
MERRY Folk used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall...
MERRY and come alive.
PIPPIN Alive?
MERRY Trees that could whisper.
MERRY Talk to each other.
MERRY Even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!
SNAGA Yeah.
SNAGA Why can?t we have some meat?
SNAGA [His eyes rest on the hobbits.] What about them?
SNAGA They?re fresh.
UGLUK They are not for eating!
GRISHNAKH What about their legs?
GRISHNAKH They don't need those.
GRISHNAKH Ooh They look tasty!
UGLUK [Shoves at the Orcs] Get back, scum!
[The other Orcs are getting restless.]
MORDOR ORC Carve them up!
SNAGA [Moves towards the hobbits with his blade drawn] Just a mouth full.
UGLUK No!
[Pippin and Merry recoil in fright.
Ugluk jumps on the Orc and cuts off his head, which bounces off the hobbit's shoulders.]
UGLUK Looks like meat?s back on the menu, boys!!
[The Uruk-hai and Orcs cheer and started tearing into the fresh meat, intestines flying, taking their eyes off the hobbits for a while.]
MERRY Pippin, let?s go.
[Their hands still bound, the hobbits try to crawl away.
Suddenly a foot comes down on Merry and Pippin is turned onto his back.]
GRISHNAKH [Brandishing a blade in front of Pippin?s face] Go on, call for help.
GRISHNAKH Squeal!
GRISHNAKH No one?s gonna save you now!
[Suddenly, a spear pierces the Orc's back.
Mayhem ensues as Riders of Rohan burst out from their hiding places and ambush the Orcs.]
MERRY Pippin!
MERRY [Gestures for them to make their escape.]
[The hobbits try to escape from the pandemonium to the forest, dodging bodies and stomping feet.
Suddenly Pippin turns onto his face and looks up to a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him.]
[The Three Hunters are still chasing after the Uruk-hai.
It is dawn.]
LEGOLAS [Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises.
LEGOLAS Blood has been spilled this night.
[Camera pans over the rock and plains, alternating between the band of Uruk-hai and the Three Hunters giving chase.
The trackers hear the sound of horses.
Aragorn and company hide behind some boulders.
A large group of horse-men appears, galloping quickly with their banners flying.
Aragorn comes out of hiding as they pass, followed by Legolas and Gimli.]
ARAGORN Riders of Rohan, what news from the Mark?
[At a signal from Eomer at the lead, the riders make a quick turn and head towards them, surrounding them in ever-tightening circles.
As they stop, they point their long spears menacingly at them.]
EOMER What business does an Elf, a man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
EOMER Speak quickly!
GIMLI Give me your name, Horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
[Eomer hands his staff to another rider, and gets off his horse.
Aragorn puts a hand on Gimli?s shoulder.]
EOMER I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
[Legolas, in a lightning fast move, points an arrow at Eomer.]
LEGOLAS You would die before your stroke fell!
[The riders all point their spears closer at the travellers.
After a tense moment, Aragorn pushes down Legolas? arm.]
ARAGORN I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
ARAGORN This is Gimli, son of Gloin and Legolas of the Woodland realm.
ARAGORN We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
EOMER Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
EOMER [Takes off helmet] Not even his own kin.
[The spears are withdrawn.]
EOMER Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
EOMER My company are those loyal to Rohan.
EOMER And for that, we are banished.
EOMER The White Wizard is cunning.
EOMER He walks here and there, they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked.
EOMER And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.
ARAGORN We are not spies.
ARAGORN We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
ARAGORN They?ve taken two of our friends captive.
EOMER The Uruks are destroyed.
EOMER We slaughtered them during the night.
GIMLI But there were two hobbits.
GIMLI Did you see two hobbits with them?
ARAGORN They would be small ? only children to your eyes.
EOMER We left none alive.
EOMER We piled the carcasses and burned them.
EOMER [Points to a smoking pile in the distance.]
GIMLI Dead?
EOMER [nods] I am sorry.
[Legolas puts a hand on Gimli?s shoulder in grief.
Eomer turns and whistles.]
EOMER Hasufel!
EOMER Arod!
EOMER [Two horses move up.] May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
EOMER Farewell.
[Eomer puts on his helmet and gets back on his horse]
EOMER Look for your friends.
EOMER But do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands.
EOMER [To the riders] We ride north!
[Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli look on as the Riders go off.
They then ride towards the burning carcasses.
Gimli starts to shift through the smoldering pile, and pulls out a charred belt and dagger sheath.]
GIMLI It?s one of their wee belts.
LEGOLAS [with his head bowed and eyes closed] Hiro ith ab 'wanath...
ARAGORN [Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!!
ARAGORN [He falls to his knees.]
GIMLI We failed them.
[Aragorn looks to the side as some tracks catch his attention.]
A hobbit lay here, and the other.
[Flashback: Pippin yells as he looks up at a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him.
He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.] They crawled.
Merry and Pippin crawl frantically away from the battle.]
Their hands were bound.
[Flashback: Merry rubs his bonds furiously against the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds were cut.
[Aragorn holds up a broken length of thick rope.]
ARAGORN They ran over here.
ARAGORN They were followed.
[FLASHBACK Their hands freed, the hobbits run away from the battle scene, dodging under a horse and trying to stay out of harms way.
[FLASHBACK As they flee, Grishnakh grabs Pippin by his belt and clings on.]
MERRY The belt!
[Pippin undoes his belt and Grishnakh is left holding it.]
MERRY Run!
ARAGORN The tracks lead away from the battle...
ARAGORN [They break into a run and then stop] into Fangorn Forest.
[The Three looks up into a dense and dark forest]
GIMLI Fangorn.
GIMLI What madness drove them in there?
[Scene moves from the trackers into the nighttime chase of Merry and Pippin.
The hobbits run into the Fangorn, seeking to lose the pursuing Orc.
They collapse onto the ground, out of breath.]
PIPPIN Did we lose him?
PIPPIN [Looks around] I think we lost him.
[Suddenly, Grishnakh appears from behind the trees, brandishing a blade.]
GRISHNAKH I?m gonna rip out your filthy little innards!
GRISHNAKH Come here!
[Merry and Pippin run and hide behind a tree.]
MERRY Trees!
MERRY Climb a tree!
[Pippin and Merry quickly scramble up a tree each.]
MERRY [Looks around and then sighs in relief.] He's gone.
[Suddenly, Merry is pulled by his legs and falls to the ground.
Grishnakh leans over him with his menacing blade.
Merry tries to kick him off but to no avail.]
PIPPIN Merry!
[Pippin looks down in horror but as he turns his head, he spots a pair of gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the tree he?s clinging to.
The tree starts to move and groan.]
TREEBEARD Hooooo...
PIPPIN Argh!!
[Pippin loses his grip in fright and grabs at the air futilely as he falls.
The tree catches him before he hits the ground.]
GRISHNAKH Let?s put a maggot-hole in your belly.
GRISHNAKH [Suddenly he senses something behind him and as he looks up, the tree stomps and squashes him onto the forest floor.]
PIPPIN Run, Merry!
[Merry tries to run away but is scooped by the tree.]
TREEBEARD [Looks at the creatures in his hands] Little Orcs!
TREEBEARD Burarum...
PIPPIN It?s talking, Merry.
PIPPIN The tree is talking!
TREEBEARD Tree?!
TREEBEARD I am no tree.
TREEBEARD I am an Ent.
TREEBEARD [Stomps slowly through the forest.]
MERRY A treeherder!
MERRY A shepherd of the forest.
PIPPIN Don?t talk to it, Merry.
PIPPIN Don?t encourage it.
TREEBEARD Treebeard, some call me.
PIPPIN And whose side are you on?
TREEBEARD Side?
TREEBEARD I am on nobody?s side because nobody?s on my side, little Orc.
TREEBEARD Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
MERRY We?re not Orcs.
MERRY We?re Hobbits!
TREEBEARD Hobbits?
TREEBEARD Never heard of a hobbit before.
TREEBEARD Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
TREEBEARD [Tightens his hold on the hobbits and squeezes them.
TREEBEARD Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain] They come with fire, they come with axes.
TREEBEARD Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
TREEBEARD Destroyers and usurpers, curse them!
MERRY No, you don?t understand.
MERRY We?re Hobbits...
MERRY Halflings!
MERRY Shirefolk!
TREEBEARD Maybe you are and maybe you aren?t.
TREEBEARD The White Wizard will know.
PIPPIN The White Wizard?
MERRY Saruman.
MERRY [Following Gollum, Frodo and Sam reach the end of Emyn Muil and see that Mordor is now closer.]
GOLLUM See, see, we have led you out!
GOLLUM Hurry hobbitses hurry.
GOLLUM Very lucky we find you.
[Gollum jumps on a rock.
Frodo walks past, Gollum shrinks as Sam draws near.]
GOLLUM Nice hobbit.
GOLLUM [Leaps after Frodo, putting a wide berth between him and Sam.]
[Sam?s foot slipped into muck.]
SAM Whoa, it?s a bog!
SAM He?s led us into a swamp!
GOLLUM A swamp, yes, yes.
GOLLUM Come, master.
GOLLUM We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
GOLLUM Come, hobbits, come.
GOLLUM We go quickly.
[Gollum looks back and gestures for the hobbits to follow.]
GOLLUM I found it, I did.
GOLLUM The way through the marshes.
GOLLUM Orcs don't use it.
GOLLUM Orcs don't know it.
GOLLUM They go round for miles and miles.
GOLLUM Come quickly.
GOLLUM Swift and quick as shadows we must be.
[The marsh lands stretch for miles and miles as far as the eye can see.
The hobbits and Gollum appear as little specks.
As the three pick their way gingerly though the marshes, they see faces floating in the water, still, rotting and pale, and flickering flames on the swamps.]
SAM There are dead things!
SAM Dead faces in the water!
GOLLUM All dead.
GOLLUM All rotten.
GOLLUM Elves and men and orcses.
GOLLUM A great battle long ago.
GOLLUM [Turns to face the hobbits.] The Dead Marshes.
GOLLUM Yes, yes that is their name.
GOLLUM This way.
GOLLUM Don?t follow the lights.
[Sam?s foot slips again into the water.]
SAM Ohh!
GOLLUM Careful now, or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
[Frodo is drawn to one of the faces in Elven armour.
He stares at it intently, until suddenly its eyes open and Frodo falls face-down into the water.]
SAM Frodo!
[Frodo is in the water and sees many faces of the dead, no longer still but screaming and grasping, their rotten robes and hair flowing about their gruesome faces.
Their hands are reaching for him.
Suddenly he is grabbed from behind.
Frodo sputters and gasps for air as Gollum pulls him out of the water.]
FRODO [Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude and disbelief.] Gollum...
GOLLUM Don?t follow the lights!
GOLLUM [Crawls away]
SAM [Runs to Frodo?s side.] Mr. Frodo!
SAM Are you alright?
[Frodo lies panting, staring after Gollum]
Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake.
He is holding the Ring in the palm of his hand and stroking it, mesmerized.
Suddenly he hears Gollum.]
GOLLUM Sooo bright.
GOLLUM Sooo beautiful.
GOLLUM [Frodo quickly puts the Ring back inside his shirt.
GOLLUM He looks up to see Gollum crouching away from him, stroking the centre of his palm] our preciousss...
FRODO What did you say?
GOLLUM Master should be resting.
GOLLUM Master needs to keep up his strength.
FRODO [Moves over and crouches in front of Gollum] Who are you?
GOLLUM Mustn?t ask us.
GOLLUM Not its business.
GOLLUM *Gollum, Gollum*
FRODO Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
GOLLUM Cold be heart and hand and bone.
GOLLUM Cold be travellers far from home.
FRODO He said your life was a sad story.
GOLLUM They do not see what lies ahead, when sun has failed and moon is dead.
FRODO You were not so very different from a hobbit once, were you...
FRODO Smeagol?
GOLLUM [Looks up slowly.] What did you call me?
FRODO That was your name once, wasn?t it?
FRODO A long time ago.
GOLLUM My name...
GOLLUM My name...
GOLLUM S...
GOLLUM S...Smeagol
[Suddenly, the piercing cries of the Nazgul are heard overhead]
GOLLUM Argh!!
SAM Black Riders!
GOLLUM Hide!
GOLLUM Hide!
FRODO Argh!
[Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of the Nazgul's sword piercing him and the call of the Ring.
Images of the Ringwraiths come to him in flashes.]
FRODO Argh!!
SAM C?mon Frodo!
SAM C'mon!
[Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring on his chest, immobilized.
Sam drags Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble bushes.
The Nazgul appears, tightening his hold on the reins.
Camera then shows him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down across the marsh lands.
Chilling screams of the Nazgul fill the air.]
GOLLUM Quick!
GOLLUM They will see us!
GOLLUM They will see us!
SAM I thought they were dead!
GOLLUM Dead?
GOLLUM No, you cannot kill them.
GOLLUM No.
[A loud screech from the Nazgul flying high above the marshes.]
GOLLUM [cowering] Wraiths!
GOLLUM Wraiths on wings!
GOLLUM They are calling for it.
GOLLUM They are calling for the preciousss.
[Frodo feels the call of the Ring and gropes for his necklace.
Sam sees this and grabs hold of Frodo?s hand.]
SAM Mr. Frodo!
SAM It?s alright.
SAM I?m here.
[The Nazgul continues to circle overhead and then flies off towards Mordor.]
GOLLUM Hurry, hobbits.
GOLLUM The Black Gate is very close.
[Scene returns to Fangorn forest.
Gimli fingers a dark stain on a leaf and brings it to his mouth.]
GIMLI [Spits] Ptui!
GIMLI Orc blood.
ARAGORN These are strange tracks.
GIMLI The air is so close in here.
LEGOLAS This forest is old.
LEGOLAS Very old.
LEGOLAS Full of memory...
LEGOLAS and anger.
[Groans reverberate through the forest and Gimli raises his axe.]
LEGOLAS The trees are speaking to each other.
ARAGORN [Whispers] Gimli!
GIMLI Huh?
ARAGORN [Gestures] Lower your axe.
GIMLI [Lowering his axe slowly] Oh.
LEGOLAS Aragorn, nad na ennas!
ARAGORN Man cenich?
ARAGORN [Close-up of Legolas? eyes]
LEGOLAS The White Wizard approaches.
ARAGORN Do not let him speak.
ARAGORN He will put a spell on us.
[Aragorn wraps his hand around the hilt of his sword, Gimli tightens his hold on his axes, and Legolas notches an arrow to his bow.]
ARAGORN We must be quick.
[With a yell, the three swing round to attack.
Gimli?s axe and Legolas? arrow are deflected.
Aragorn drops his sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp.
They shield their eyes with their hands from the bright light emanating from the White Wizard.]
WHITE WIZARD You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.
ARAGORN Where are they?
WHITE WIZARD They passed this way the day before yesterday.
WHITE WIZARD They met someone they did not expect.
WHITE WIZARD Does that comfort you?
ARAGORN Who are you?
ARAGORN Show yourself!
[The bright light dims, revealing Gandalf, all dressed in white.
The three are astounded.
Legolas and Gimli bow.]
ARAGORN It cannot be.
ARAGORN You fell.
Through fire and water.
[Flashback: Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop Durin?s Tower.] From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
[Gandalf holds up Glamdring and a flash of lightning strikes it before he plunges the sword into the Balrog.
With a final cry, the Balrog falls from the peak and lands, smoking, onto the icy mountainside.]
GANDALF Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
[On top of the mountain, Gandalf crawls a bit and then collapses.]
GANDALF Darkness took me.
GANDALF And I strayed out of thought and time.
GANDALF [Camera zooms in Gandalf?s eye and enters an amorphous realm of stars and galaxies, ending in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth.
GANDALF But it was not the end.
GANDALF I felt life in me again.
[Camera zooms out from Gandalf?s eye, lying naked and very still.
His hair has turned white and wounds are completely healed.
He suddenly shudders with a deep gasp and pants as life returns to him]
GANDALF I've been sent back until my task is done.
ARAGORN Gandalf!
GANDALF Gandalf?
GANDALF Yes...
GANDALF That's what they used to call me.
GANDALF Gandalf the Grey.
GANDALF That was my name.
GANDALF [He smiles]
GIMLI Gandalf!
GANDALF [With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf the White.
GANDALF [Aragorn grins] And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
[They walk through the forest, with Gandalf leading the way, now wearing a grey cloak over his white robes.]
GANDALF One stage of your journey is over, another begins.
GANDALF War has come to Rohan.
GANDALF We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
[Outside the forest, Gandalf whistles piercingly.
Soon an answering neigh is heard and a white horse appears from the plain, answering the call.]
LEGOLAS That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
[The horse comes round to stop in front of Gandalf.]
GANDALF Shadowfax.
GANDALF [Gimli bows in the background.] He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.
GANDALF [Back at Fangorn, Treebeard is walking through the forest with Merry and Pippin sitting on his shoulders.]
TREEBEARD My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
TREEBEARD I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where I?ll keep you.
TREEBEARD The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
TREEBEARD Anger festers in their hearts.
TREEBEARD They will harm you if they can.
TREEBEARD There are too few of us now.
TREEBEARD Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
[Frodo and Sam are climbing a high rock overlooking Morannon.]
GOLLUM The Black Gate of Mordor.
[The enormous Black Gate comes into view with Orcs patrolling and standing guard on the towers and atop the walls.
From the right, an army of Easterling soldiers is marching to the Black Gate.]
SAM Oh save us.
SAM My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
GOLLUM Master says to show him the way into Mordor, so good Smeagol does.
GOLLUM Master says so.
FRODO I did.
[Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.]
SAM That?s it then.
SAM We cannot get past that.
[A command is heard and an Orc sounds a horn, signalling for the Gate to be opened.
Two enormous cave trolls stretch and growl and then pull the mighty Gate open.]
SAM Look!
SAM The gate, it's opening!
SAM I can see a way down.
[He moves closer to the edge.
Suddenly, the rock underneath him gives way and he falls.]
FRODO Sam, no!
SAM Argh!!
[Frodo goes after Sam.]
GOLLUM Master!
[Two Easterling soldiers see streams of dust coming down the cliff made by Sam and Frodo.
They move away from the troop to investigate.
Frodo reaches Sam who is stuck in the scree.
As the Easterlings move closer and closer, Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself and Sam.
The soldiers are now directly in front of Sam, but their eyes see nothing but rock.
Frodo and Sam peer from underneath the cloak.
The soldiers soon leave and after a moment, Frodo throws back the cloak and pulls Sam out.]
FRODO I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
SAM I know, Mr Frodo.
SAM I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
[They prepare to make a run for the Gate.]
FRODO Now!
[Gollum pulls them back.]
GOLLUM No!
GOLLUM No, no master!
GOLLUM They catch you!
GOLLUM They catch you!
GOLLUM Don?t take it to him!
GOLLUM He wants the preciousss.
GOLLUM Always he?s looking for it!
GOLLUM And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him.
GOLLUM But we mustn?t let him have it.
[Frodo tries to make a run for it.]
GOLLUM No!
GOLLUM [Pulls Frodo back again.] There?s another way.
GOLLUM More secret.
GOLLUM A dark way.
SAM Why haven?t you spoken of this before?!
GOLLUM Because Master did not ask!
SAM He?s up to something.
FRODO Are you saying there?s another way into Mordor?
GOLLUM Yes.
GOLLUM There is a path, and some stairs, and then a tunnel.
GOLLUM [Frodo and Sam watch as the Black Gate closes.
GOLLUM Gollum is stroking Frodo?s arm and burying his face in his cloak.]
FRODO He?s led us this far, Sam.
SAM Mr. Frodo, no.
FRODO He?s been true to his word.
SAM [Whispers] No!
FRODO Lead the way, Smeagol.
GOLLUM Good Smeagol always helps.
GOLLUM [On the plains of Rohan.
GOLLUM Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli stop as Edoras comes into view.]
GANDALF Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
GANDALF There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown.
GANDALF Saruman?s hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
[In the Hall, Eowyn is kneeling before Theoden, holding his hand in hers.]
EOWYN My lord, your son, he is dead.
EOWYN My lord?
EOWYN Uncle?
[Theoden just sits and stares ahead, his eyes clouded and unseeing.]
EOWYN Will you not go to him?
EOWYN [She weeps.] Will you do nothing?
[Scene returns to Gandalf and company.]
GANDALF Be careful what you say.
GANDALF Do not look for welcome here.
GANDALF [At Edoras, Eowyn is weeping at the dead Theodred's bed.
GANDALF She kisses his hand.
GANDALF Grima appears at the door.]
GRIMA Oh, he he must have died sometime in the night.
GRIMA What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
[He sits on the bed and puts a hand on Eowyn?s shoulder.]
GRIMA I understand his passing is hard to accept, especially now that your brother has deserted you.
EOWYN [jumps back and throws off Grima?s hand] Leave me alone, snake!
GRIMA [Rises from the bed and moves ever closer to Eowyn] Oh, but you are alone!
GRIMA Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness.
GRIMA In bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, like a hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
[He puts a hand on her cheek and moves down to her throat.]
GRIMA So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
[Eowyn and Grima stare at each other intently.]
EOWYN Your words are poison!
[Eowyn runs out of the hall.
Weeping, she looks away into the distance.
A flag comes off its pole and is carried by the breeze.
Eowyn sees riders coming towards Edoras.
As Aragorn passes the entrance to Edoras, the flag floats down to land near him.
Edoras is silent and somber.
Everyone is dressed in black and staring at the newcomers in wary silence.
Aragorn looks up at the hall and sees a lady in white standing on the steps.
He looks around at more somber people.]
GIMLI You?ll find more cheer in a graveyard.
[Aragorn looks up to the hall again but the lady has disappeared.
The company climbs up the stairs to the hall and is met by guards.]
GANDALF [sees Hama] Ah.
HAMA I cannot allow you before Theoden-King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
HAMA By order of Grima Wormtongue.
[Gandalf nods in understanding and signals for the others to surrender their weapons.
Aragon hands over his sword and knives.
Legolas gives a little twirl to his knives before handing them over to the guards.
Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.]
HAMA [gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.
GANDALF Hmm?
GANDALF [Glances at his staff.] Oh.
GANDALF You would not part an old man from his walking stick?
GANDALF [Looks at Hama innocently.]
[Hama hesitates for a second and then gestures that they follow him into the hall.
Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas? arm.]
GRIMA [Leaning down and whispering to Theoden.] My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
GRIMA He?s a herald of woe.
GANDALF The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Theoden King.
[As Gandalf approaches Theoden, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey the hall and its hostile occupants.
A group of men starts to follow their steps with hostility.]
GRIMA [Whispering to Theoden.] He?s not welcome.
THEODEN Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow?
THEODEN [Looks to Grima for affirmation.]
GRIMA A just question, my liege.
GRIMA [He walks towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
GRIMA Lathspell spell I name him.
GRIMA Ill news is an ill guest.
GANDALF Be silent!
GANDALF Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth.
GANDALF I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm!
GANDALF [Raises his staff against Grima.]
GRIMA His staff!
GRIMA [Backing away from Gandalf while addressing the guards] I told you to take the wizard?s staff!
[The hostile guards attack.
Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight as Gandalf continues to approach Theoden.
Gamling tries to go forward but Hama holds him back.]
GANDALF Theoden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows.
[Grima tries to crawl away unnoticed, but Gimli catches him and pins him to the floor.]
GIMLI [Growls] I would stay still, if I were you.
GANDALF Hearken to me!
GANDALF I release you from the spell.
GANDALF [Gestures with his hand]
THEODEN [Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah!
THEODEN [Gandalf opens his eyes in surprise.] You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
[Gandalf throws back his grey cloak, exuding blinding white light.
Theoden is thrown back against his seat.]
THEODEN Argh!
GANDALF [Points his staff towards Theoden.] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
[Eowyn rushes in.
Seeing her uncle threatened, she tries to go to him but is held back by Aragorn.]
ARAGORN Wait.
THEODEN [In Saruman?s voice.] If I go.
THEODEN Theoden dies.
[Gandalf moves his staff sharply and Theoden flies back against the chair again.]
GANDALF You did not kill me, you will not kill him!
THEODEN [in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!
GANDALF Be gone!!
[Gandalf smites Theoden as he lunges at him.
Theoden is thrown back into the chair and the shot changes to Saruman flying backwards from the Palantir which he used to manipulate Theoden.
He lands landing hard on the floor of Orthanc, bleeding from a gash in his forehead.
In the hall, Theoden lets out a moan and slumps forward in the chair.
Eowyn runs to her uncle?s side as he falls.
Theoden?s head rises again and his face begins to change gradually into that of a much younger-looking man.
Clarity and recognition returns to his eyes.]
THEODEN [Looks closely at Eowyn] I know your face.
THEODEN Eowyn Eowyn.
[Eowyn weeps with joy]
THEODEN Gandalf?
GANDALF Breathe the free air again, my friend.
[The hall is shown to be filled with light again, as everyone marvels at the rejuvenation of the king.]
THEODEN [Standing up and looking around him.] Dark have been my dreams of late.
THEODEN [He looks down at his trembling hands.]
GANDALF Your fingers would remember their old strength better...
GANDALF if they grasped your sword.
[Hama runs up with his sword.
Theoden reaches for it with trembling hands.
He wraps his fingers around it slowly and then draws it, gazing upon the shiny steel.
In a corner, Grima trembles and tries to escape but is pulled back by Gimli.
Suddenly, Theoden?s gaze turns to Grima.
Grima is thrown out of the hall and down the stairs.]
GRIMA Argh!
GRIMA [Beseechingly to Theoden] I've only ever served you, my lord!
THEODEN [Advancing towards Grima, holding the sword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
GRIMA [Grovelling] Send me not from your side.
[Theoden raises his sword to kill Grima.
Aragorn holds him back.]
ARAGORN No, my lord!
ARAGORN No, my lord.
ARAGORN Let him go.
ARAGORN Enough blood has been spilled on his account.
[Grima scrambles to his feet and pushes through the crowd]
GRIMA Get out of my way!
HAMA Hail, Theoden king!
[The crowd kneels in homage before Theoden.
Aragorn kneels also.
Grima rides out of Edoras.
As Theoden turns to go back into the hall, he looks up.]
THEODEN Where is Theodred?
THEODEN Where is my son?
[A white flower comes into view, held up by a hand.
It is released and spirals down to land among similar flowers, in front of a tomb.]
THEODEN Simbelmyne.
THEODEN Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
THEODEN [Looks at Gandalf] Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
THEODEN Alas, that these evil days should be mine.
THEODEN The young perish and the old linger.
THEODEN That I should live to see the last days of my house.
GANDALF Theodred?s death was not of your making.
THEODEN No parent should have to bury their child.
[Theoden starts to weep]
GANDALF He was strong in life.
GANDALF His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
GANDALF Westu hal.
GANDALF Fer?u, Theodred, Fer?u.
GANDALF (Be-thou well.
GANDALF Go-thou, Theodred, go-thou.)
[Gandalf turns to go back to the hall and leaves Theoden to grieve in private.
He spots two children on horseback.
The boy collapses and falls off the horse.
Later, inside the Golden Hall, the two children are eating at a table, and Eowyn is with them.]
EOWYN They had no warning.
EOWYN They were unarmed.
EOWYN Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
EOWYN Rick, cot and tree.
FREDA Where?s mama?
EOWYN Shh...
GANDALF This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
GANDALF All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
GANDALF Ride out and meet him head on.
GANDALF Draw him away from your women and children.
GANDALF [Leans forward and puts a hand on Theoden?s chair.
GANDALF Theoden looks at his hand warily.] You must fight.
ARAGORN You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak.
ARAGORN Eomer is loyal to you.
ARAGORN His men will return and fight for their king.
THEODEN They will be three hundred leagues from here by now.
THEODEN Eomer cannot help us.
THEODEN I know what it is that you want of me.
THEODEN But I will not bring further death to my people.
THEODEN I will not risk open war.
[Gimli takes a bite of his bread as he watches the exchange between Aragorn and Theoden.]
ARAGORN Open war is upon you.
ARAGORN Whether you would risk it or not.
THEODEN When last I looked, Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
[Gimli takes a drink and burps.]
GANDALF Then what is the king?s decision?
[Scene shifts to outside Meduseld]
HAMA By order of the king, the city must empty.
HAMA We make for the refuge of Helm?s Deep.
HAMA Do not burden yourselves with treasures.
HAMA Take only what provisions you need.
[People are moving about, gathering their belongings and preparing to move.
Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli walk towards the stables.]
GIMLI Helm?s Deep!
GIMLI They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
GIMLI Who will defend them if not their king.
ARAGORN He?s only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
ARAGORN Helm?s Deep has saved them in the past.
[They enter the stables]
GANDALF There is no way out of that ravine.
GANDALF Theoden is walking into a trap.
GANDALF He thinks he?s leading them to safety.
GANDALF What they will get is a massacre.
GANDALF Theoden has a strong will but I fear for him.
GANDALF I fear for the survival of Rohan.
GANDALF He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
GANDALF The people of Rohan will need you.
GANDALF The defences HAVE to hold.
ARAGORN They will hold.
GANDALF [Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him] The Grey Pilgrim...
GANDALF that?s what they used to call me.
GANDALF Three hundred lives of men I?ve walked this earth and now I have no time.
GANDALF With luck, my search will not be in vain.
GANDALF Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
GANDALF At dawn, look to the East.
ARAGORN [Opens the stall gates] Go.
ARAGORN [Eowyn opens a chest in which lies a sword.
ARAGORN She unsheathes it and begins to practice.
ARAGORN She swings around and is met by Aragorn, who blocks her parry.]
ARAGORN You have some skill with a blade.
[With a swift move, Eowyn swings her sword and renders Aragorn vulnerable, gaining the upper hand.]
EOWYN [Stepping back and sheathing her sword.]
Women of this country learned long ago: Those without swords may still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
ARAGORN What do you fear, my lady?
EOWYN A cage.
EOWYN To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
ARAGORN You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
ARAGORN [He sheaths his knife.] I do not think that would be your fate.
ARAGORN [The people of Rohan are moving out of Edoras towards Helm?s Deep, with Theoden leading the way.
ARAGORN At Isengard, Grima confers with Saruman, holding a cloth to his mouth.]
GRIMA Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
GRIMA It?s vulnerable, he knows this.
GRIMA He will expect an attack on the city.
GRIMA They will flee to Helm?s Deep, the great fortress of Rohan.
GRIMA It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
GRIMA They will be slow.
GRIMA They will have women and children with them.
[Saruman?s eyebrows rise in response.
He walks through the depths of Isengard and gives orders to an Orc.]
SARUMAN Send out your warg riders.
SARUMAN [Gollum is trying to catch a fish in the river.
SARUMAN He slips and falls, grasping at a slippery fish as he goes.
SARUMAN Frodo and Sam follow behind.]
SAM Hey Stinker!
SAM Don?t go getting too far ahead!
FRODO Why do you do that?
SAM What?
FRODO Call him names; run him down all the time.
SAM Because because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
SAM There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit.
SAM It's the Ring he wants.
SAM It's all he cares about.
FRODO [Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what it did to him.
FRODO What it?s still doing to him.
FRODO [He walks past Sam and stops.] I want to help him, Sam...
SAM Why?
FRODO Because I have to believe he can come back.
SAM You can?t save him, Mr. Frodo.
FRODO [Snapping at Sam]What do you know about it?
FRODO Nothing!
[Sam walks away slowly.]
FRODO [With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam.
FRODO I don't know why I said that.
SAM [Looks back at Frodo with tears in his eyes.] I do.
SAM It's the Ring.
SAM You can't take your eyes off it.
SAM I've seen you.
SAM You're not eating.
SAM You barely sleep.
SAM It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo.
SAM You have to fight it!
FRODO [Grows angry again] I know what I have to do Sam.
FRODO The Ring was entrusted to me!
FRODO It's my task!
FRODO Mine!
FRODO My own!
FRODO [He walks away]
SAM Can?t you hear yourself?
SAM Don?t you know who you sound like?
SAM [Nighttime, Frodo and Sam are asleep.
SAM Gollum is crouching in a corner by himself.]
GOLLUM We wants it.
GOLLUM We needs it.
GOLLUM Must have the precioussss.
GOLLUM They stole it from us.
GOLLUM Sneaky little hobbitsesss.
GOLLUM Wicked, trickssssy, falssse!
SMEAGOL No!
SMEAGOL Not Master.
GOLLUM Yes, precious.
GOLLUM False.
GOLLUM They will cheat you, hurt you, lie.
SMEAGOL Master?s my friend.
GOLLUM [Tauntingly] You don?t have any friends.
GOLLUM Nobody likes YOU...
SMEAGOL [Covers his ears] Not listening.
SMEAGOL I?m not listening.
GOLLUM You?re a liar and a thief.
SMEAGOL [Shaking his head] Nope.
GOLLUM Mur derer !
SMEAGOL [Starts to weep and whimper] Go away.
GOLLUM Go away!
GOLLUM [Cackles] HAHAHAHA!!
SMEAGOL [Weeping and in a small voice] I hate you.
SMEAGOL I hate you!
GOLLUM [Fiercely] Where would you be without me?
GOLLUM *Gollum, gollum*.
GOLLUM I saved us.
GOLLUM It was me.
GOLLUM We survived because of me!
SMEAGOL [Resolute] Not anymore.
GOLLUM [Startled] What did you say?
SMEAGOL Master looks after us now.
SMEAGOL We don?t need you.
GOLLUM What?
SMEAGOL Leave now and never come back.
GOLLUM No!!
SMEAGOL [Louder] Leave now and never come back!
GOLLUM [Growls and bares his teeth] Arrrgh!!!
[Smeagol pants and then looks around.]
SMEAGOL We...
SMEAGOL we told him to go away!
SMEAGOL And away he goes, preciousss.
SMEAGOL [He hops around in joy and does a little dance.] Gone, gone, gone!
SMEAGOL Smeagol is free!
[The next day, while the hobbits were resting, Smeagol comes back with two rabbits and drops them onto Frodo?s lap.]
SMEAGOL Look!
SMEAGOL Look!
SMEAGOL See what Smeagol finds!
SMEAGOL Hehehe!
SMEAGOL Hahaha!
[Frodo looks at up him with bloodshot eyes.
He smiles at Smeagol and looks at Sam.
Smeagol raises a fist in self-congratulation and dances around.
He then picks up one of the rabbits and snaps the rabbit's back in front of Frodo.]
SMEAGOL They are young.
SMEAGOL They are tender.
SMEAGOL They are nice.
SMEAGOL Yes they are!
SMEAGOL Eat them!
SMEAGOL Eat them!
[He bites and tears into the raw meat.
Sam rushes over and snatches the rabbit out of Gollum?s hands]
SAM You?ll make him sick, you will, behaving like that!
SAM [Holding up the two rabbits] There?s only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
[A pot of stew is simmering over a fire.]
SMEAGOL [Looking into the pot] Argh!!
SMEAGOL What?s it doing!
SMEAGOL Stupid fat hobbit!
SMEAGOL It ruins it!
SAM What?s to ruin?
SAM There?s hardly any meat on ?em.
[A faint calling sound catches the attention of Frodo.]
SAM What we need is a few good taters.
GOLLUM What?s taters, preciousss?
GOLLUM What?s taters uh?
SAM PO-TAY-TOES!
SAM Boil ?em.
SAM Mash ?em.
SAM Stick ?em in a stew.
SAM Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish....
SMEAGOL [Sticks out his tongue in disgust] Pbbbttt!!
SAM Even you couldn?t say no to that.
SAM [He takes a sip of the stew]
SMEAGOL Oh yes we could!
SMEAGOL Spoil nice fish...
SMEAGOL [scrambles up close to Sam] Give it to usss rrraw...
SMEAGOL and wrrriggling!
SMEAGOL [Makes sickeningly happy face.] You keep nasty chips.
SMEAGOL [Hops away]
SAM You?re hopeless.
[Frodo follows the source of the sound.
Sam suddenly notices that Frodo is no longer in his sight.]
SAM Mr. Frodo?
[He goes in search of Frodo and finds him lying down near some bushes looking at a Haradrim army marching across the land.
He moves to lie low beside Frodo.
Smeagol also moves in beside Frodo.]
SAM Who are they?
GOLLUM Wicked men.
GOLLUM Servants of Sauron.
GOLLUM They are called to Mordor.
GOLLUM The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
GOLLUM It won?t be long now.
GOLLUM He will soon be ready.
SAM Ready to do what?
GOLLUM To make his war.
GOLLUM The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.
FRODO We?ve got to get moving.
FRODO Come on, Sam.
SAM [Suddenly grabs Frodo?s arm] Mr Frodo!
SAM Look!
SAM It?s an Oliphaunt!
[Gigantic Oliphaunts appear, carrying soldiers and supplies on their backs.]
SAM No one at home will believe this...
[Smeagol slips away unnoticed.]
FRODO [Looking around] Smeagol?
[Suddenly, pandemonium breaks out from below; the soldiers are being ambushed.
Cloaked rangers are firing deadly arrows at the soldiers and Oliphaunts from behind bushes.
One of the Oliphaunts starts trumpeting and stomping towards Frodo and Sam, swinging his huge trunk and tusks.
Faramir takes aim and shoots a soldier.
He falls from the Oliphaunt and lands right behind Frodo and Sam, dead.]
FRODO We?ve lingered here too long.
FRODO Come on, Sam!
[Frodo runs right into a Gondorian Ranger, who grabs hold of him and throws him onto his back.
Sam sees Frodo in danger and grapples for his sword]
SAM Ah!
[He charges at Faramir but is grabbed by another ranger and thrown down.
A sword appears at his throat.
Faramir appears.]
FARAMIR Bind their hands.
[Meanwhile, the Rohirrim refugees are heading towards Helm?s Deep.
Gimli is on a horse, chatting with Eowyn who is leading it by the reins.]
GIMLI It?s true you don?t see many Dwarf women.
GIMLI And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, haha that they?re often mistaken for Dwarf men.
[Eowyn smiles and looks back at Aragorn.]
ARAGORN [Gestures and whispers] It?s the beards....
GIMLI And this, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women.
GIMLI And that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground!
EOWYN [Laughs gaily] Hahahaha!!
GIMLI Hehehe!
GIMLI Which is of course ridiculous Whoa!!
[The horse suddenly rears up and gallops away as Eowyn loses her hold on the reins.
Gimli falls off after a short distance and lands with a loud thump.]
EOWYN Ooh!
EOWYN [She rushes forward to Gimli]
GIMLI [Struggling to get up] It?s alright, it?s alright.
GIMLI Nobody panic.
GIMLI That was deliberate.
GIMLI It was deliberate.
[Eowyn helps Gimli up.
She laughs as she brushes him off and looks back at Aragorn with the sun behind her and the wind in her hair.
At that particular moment, Aragorn seems enchanted by Eowyn?s light-hearted image.
That night.
Aragorn could not sleep and smokes his pipe as he thinks of Arwen.]
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane It is mine to give to whom I will...
Like my heart Go to sleep...
[FLASHBACK Aragorn is lying on a chaise in Rivendell.
[FLASHBACK He opens his eyes and sees Arwen before him, smiling down at him.]
ARAGORN I am asleep.
ARAGORN This is a dream.
ARWEN [Bends down to kiss him] Then it is a good dream.
ARWEN Sleep
[She kisses him lightly on the lips and then steps away to look out upon Rivendell.
Aragorn closes his eyes but for a while.
He looks over at Arwen.]
ARAGORN Min lu pennich nin i aur hen telitha.
ARWEN [Turns to look at Aragorn] U i vethed...
ARWEN na i onnad.
ARWEN Boe bedich go Frodo.
ARWEN Han bad lin.
ARWEN (This is not the end...
ARWEN it is the beginning.
ARWEN You must go with Frodo.
ARWEN That is your path.)
ARAGORN [Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i vad o nin.
ARWEN Si peliannen i vad na dail lin.
ARWEN Si boe u-dhannathach.
ARWEN (It is already laid before your feet.
ARWEN You cannot falter now.)
ARAGORN Arwen
[Arwen hushes him, resting her fingers on his lips.
As her hands moves down to rest on the Evenstar pendant around Aragorn?s neck, he clasps her hand in his and they gaze into each other?s eyes.]
ARWEN Ae u-esteliach nad...
ARWEN estelio han.
ARWEN Estelio ammen.
ARWEN (If you trust nothing else...
ARWEN trust this.
ARWEN Trust us.)
ARWEN [The next day, on the journey to Helm?s Deep.
ARWEN Eowyn is walking alongside Aragorn.]
EOWYN Where is she?
EOWYN The woman who gave you that jewel.
Elrond is speaking to Aragorn in Rivendell, before he sets out with the Fellowship.]
ELROND Our time here is ending.
ELROND Arwen?s time is ending.
ELROND Let her go.
ELROND Let her take the ship into the west.
ELROND Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
ELROND There it will be evergreen.
ARAGORN But never more than a memory.
ELROND I will not leave my daughter here to die.
ARAGORN She stays because she still has hope.
ELROND She stays for YOU!
ELROND She belongs with her people!
[Aragorn and Arwen are together before the Fellowship departs.]
ARAGORN Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel.
ARAGORN Hae o auth a nir a naeth.
ARAGORN (You have a chance for another life.
ARAGORN Away from war...
ARAGORN grief...
ARAGORN despair.)
ARWEN Why are you saying this?
ARAGORN I am mortal; you are Elfkind.
ARAGORN It was a dream, Arwen, nothing more.
[He takes Arwen?s hand to return the Evenstar necklace to her.]
ARAGORN This belongs to you.
ARWEN [Closes Aragorn?s hand over the Evenstar] It was a gift.
ARWEN Keep it.
[Scene shifts back to Aragorn and Eowyn]
EOWYN My lord?
ARAGORN She is sailing to the Undying Lands, with all that is left of her kin.
[Gamling and Hama ride to the front.
Legolas watches them as they pass.]
GAMLING What is it?
GAMLING Hama?
[Their horses become restless.]
HAMA [Looking around] I?m not sure.
[A warg scout appears on a slope above and charges at them.
The warg attacks Hama and kills him.]
GAMLING Wargs!
[Just as it starts to turn on Gamling, Legolas runs over and kills the warg with an arrow.
He then draws his knife and kills the Orc.]
LEGOLAS Argh!
LEGOLAS [Shouts to Aragorn] A scout!
THEODEN What is it?
THEODEN What do you see?
ARAGORN [Running back to Theoden] Wargs!
ARAGORN We are under attack!
[Hearing the alarm, the villagers begin to cry and panic.]
ARAGORN Get them out of here!
THEODEN All riders to the head of the column!
GIMLI [Trying to mount Arod] Come on, get me up here, I?m a rider!
GIMLI Argh!
[Gimli gets onto the horse with some help.
Legolas gazes into the distance and sees many warg-riders coming fast towards them, kicking up dust trails as they go.]
THEODEN [To Eowyn] You must lead the people to Helm?s Deep.
THEODEN And make haste!
EOWYN I can fight!
THEODEN No!
THEODEN You must do this...
THEODEN for me.
[Eowyn holds Theoden?s gaze for a moment and then turn to attend to the villagers.]
THEODEN [To his men] Follow me!
THEODEN Yah!
GIMLI [Tries to get Arod to move] Forward.
GIMLI I mean, charge forward!
GIMLI March forward!
GIMLI [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather unsteadily.] That?s it!
GIMLI Go on!
EOWYN [To the villagers] Make for the lower ground!
EOWYN Stick together!
EOWYN [Legolas takes aim at the distant target and fells a warg rider.
EOWYN He draws another arrow and kills another.
EOWYN Just as he reaches for a third arrow, he sees Theoden and company approaching.
EOWYN He quickly runs and mounts Arod with a smooth leap and joins in the fray with Gimli behind him on horseback.]
Argh!!
[The Rohirrim and warg riders crash head on and the battle begins.
Theoden and company hack away at the warg riders.
In the midst of fighting, Gimli falls off Arod.
He turns to find a warg growling at him.]
GIMLI Bring your pretty face to my axe!
[Just as the warg leaps at Gimli, Legolas kills it with one shot.]
GIMLI [Jumping back as the warg falls, outraged] Argh!
GIMLI That one counts as mine!
[As Gimli swings his axe at another warg, it dies and falls onto Gimli, pinning him under.]
GIMLI Argh!
GIMLI Stinking creature.
GIMLI Argh!
[As he tries to lift the warg off him, an Orc leans over them both.
Gimli kills him quickly, twisting his neck, and it lands on him also.
Gimli sniffs at the Orc and makes a face.
He tries to lift both the warg and Orc off him.
Just then, another warg comes upon him and bares its teeth, ready to strike.
GIMLI [Eyes widening] Ooh..!
[Aragorn plucks a spear as he passes on horseback and throws it at the warg.
It dies, landing on Gimli and adding to the pile on top of him.]
GIMLI [As the warg lands on him] Oooh!!
[Theoden stabs at a warg rider.
Aragorn is knocked off Hasufel and attacked by Sharku.
Aragorn tries to kill the warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while the latter is half-dragged by the warg.
In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off and he rips the Evenstar pendant from Aragorn?s neck as he falls.
Aragorn tries to let go of the warg but finds his wrist tangled with the saddle straps.
He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle himself and is dragged closer and closer to the edge of a cliff at great speed.
The warg runs right off the cliff and they both disappear over the edge.
The battle is winding down as the Rohirrim finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.]
LEGOLAS [Looking around] Aragorn!
GIMLI Aragorn?
[They come near to the cliff and hear Sharku wheezing and laughing]
GIMLI [Standing over the dying Orc] Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He?s [cough] dead.
[Laughs evilly] Took a little tumble off the cliff.
LEGOLAS [Looks towards the edge of the cliff, and grabs Sharku] You lie!
[Sharku chortles and dies.
Legolas looks down at Sharku?s fist and finds the Evenstar pendant.
He takes it, runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down to see the great drop and rushing waters below, with no sign of Aragorn.
Gimli comes to stand beside him.]
THEODEN [To his men] Get the wounded on horses.
THEODEN The wolves of Isengard will return.
THEODEN Leave the dead.
[Legolas turns to Theoden, an expression of perplexed anger on his face.]
THEODEN [Puts a hand on Legolas' shoulder] Come.
THEODEN [The Rohan villagers are drawing close to Helm?s Deep.
THEODEN Cries of relief are heard as the refuge is within sight.]
REFUGEES Helm?s Deep!
REFUGEES At last!
REFUGEES There it is!
[To Eowyn] We?re safe, my lady!
Thank you!
[Eowyn embraces the woman and they walk on towards Helm?s Deep.
The gate is opened for the villagers.
Many have already taken refuge within and are resting along the passage.
Eothain and Freda run towards their mother.]
FREDA Mama!
MORWEN Eothain!
MORWEN Freda!
[The three hug and cry with joy.
Theoden and company returns from the battle with warg riders]
GAMLING Make way for Theoden!
Sire!
GAMLING Make way for the king!
[Eowyn rushes down to meet them]
EOWYN [Looking about] So few.
EOWYN So few of you have returned.
THEODEN [Dismounting] Our people are safe.
THEODEN We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLI [Going up to Eowyn] My lady...
EOWYN Lord Aragorn, where is he?
GIMLI He fell...
GIMLI [At the battlements]
THEODEN Draw all our forces behind the wall.
THEODEN Bar the gate, and set a watch on the surround.
GAMLING What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
GAMLING The women and children?
THEODEN Get them into the caves.
THEODEN [Walks down the steps and past a sewer gate] Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
[Camera zooms in on the gate]
Helm?s Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
[Camera turns to Grima and Saruman at Orthanc.
Saruman is pouring some dark dry substances into a vessel.
Grima is holding a lit candle in his hand.]
GRIMA How?
GRIMA How can fire undo stone?
GRIMA What kind of device could bring down the wall?
[As he steps closer to the vessel, Saruman takes hold of Grima?s hand and pushes the candle away from the vessel firmly.]
SARUMAN If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
[He walks away towards the balcony.]
GRIMA [Following Saruman] Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep.
SARUMAN Tens of thousands.
GRIMA But, my lord, there is no such force.
[Both of them came onto the balcony of the tower.
Grima suddenly sees and hears the enormous armies laid out below in neat rows and is astounded and awed.
He continues to hold the extinguished candle aloft as he gapes at the vast army below.
A horn is sounded, announcing the appearance of Saruman.
A loud cheer is heard from the army.
Saruman raises a hand.]
SARUMAN A new power is rising.
SARUMAN Its victory is at hand!
[The army cheers and roars.]
SARUMAN This night, the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
SARUMAN March to Helms Deep!
SARUMAN Leave none alive!
[The camera keeps zooming out from the balcony over the incredible size of Saruman?s army, past Uruk-hai, spears, and banners and yet more Uruk-hai.
The camera focuses back on Saruman who then raises his hands in the air]
SARUMAN To war!!
[The army cheers and roars even louder.]
SARUMAN [Sneers] There will be no dawn for Men.
SARUMAN [Merry and Pippin are travelling through the forest, carried by Treebeard.]
PIPPIN Look!
PIPPIN There?s smoke to the south!
TREEBEARD There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
MERRY Isengard?
[The two hobbits climb higher up onto Treebeard for a better view.]
TREEBEARD There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
TREEBEARD But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
TREEBEARD He no longer cares for growing things.
[Pippin and Merry are now on top of Treebeard and they see a massive army moving across the land]
PIPPIN What is it?
MERRY It?s Saruman?s army!
MERRY The war has started.
[Aragorn is floating in the river, unconscious.
He is washed ashore and dreams of Arwen.]
ARWEN [Kissing him on the lips] May the grace of the Valar protect you.
[A horse arrives and nudges Aragorn, turning him over and nuzzling him.]
ARAGORN [Mumbles] Brego [He grabs hold of Brego?s mane, pulls himself onto the horse and rides slowly to Helms Deep.]
[Arwen is lying on her bed, deep in thought.]
ELROND [Coming into her room] Arwen.
[Arwen hears him and sits up.]
ELROND Tollen i lu.
ELROND I chair gwannar na Valannor.
ELROND Si bado, no cirar.
ELROND (Arwen, it is time.
ELROND The ships are leaving for Valinor.
ELROND Go now...
ELROND before it is too late.)
ARWEN I have made my choice.
ELROND He is not coming back.
ELROND Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
ARWEN There is still hope.
ELROND [Walks towards window and looks out] If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
ELROND If Sauron is defeated, and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true, you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
ELROND Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will die.
[Arwen sees a vision of her future as Elrond speaks.
She is dressed as a queen in mourning garb and looking down upon Aragorn, a crown on his brow, Anduril in his hand, and dead.
Mourners are walking around the altar, paying their final respects.
Arwen is weeping.]
ELROND And there will be no comfort for you.
ELROND No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
ELROND He will come to death, an image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
[The body of Aragorn is now cast as a monument in stone.
Arwen stands before the monument, veiled and in black.]
ELROND But you, my daughter, you will linger on in darkness and in doubt.
ELROND As nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
ELROND Here you will dwell, bound to your grief, under the fading trees, until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
[Still veiled in black, Arwen is walking alone through the deserted woods of Lothlorien.]
ELROND [Tuning to Arwen] Arwen...
ELROND there is nothing for you here, only death.
[The vision ends and Arwen weeps with sadness and fear.
Elrond comes to sit beside his daughter and raises a hand to her cheek.]
ELROND A im, u-'erin veleth lin?
ARWEN [Crying and moving into her father?s embrace] Gerich meleth nin, ada.
ARWEN [Elves, cloaked and carrying a lantern each, are setting off from Rivendell on their journey to the West.
ARWEN Elrond looks on as Arwen leaves with them.
ARWEN Arwen turns back to look at her father one last time before she departs.
ARWEN Elrond continues to stare after her with an expression of resigned sadness.]
[Elrond is standing by a window.
He hears Galadriel speaking.]
I amar prestar aen...
han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han nostan ned gwilith.
(The world has changed...
I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it in the air.)
The power of the enemy is growing.
[Saruman is communicating with Sauron via the Palantir.] Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
[View of Saruman's marching army] The eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last free kingdom of men.
[View of Osgiliath] His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ringbearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand.
[Close-up of Galadriel] The quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
[Close-up of the Ring spinning in slow motion]
GALADRIEL (V.O.) In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
GALADRIEL (V.O.) It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men.
[We see Faramir and Gondorian rangers with the captured Frodo and Sam.]
GALADRIEL (V.O.) Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
GALADRIEL (V.O.) The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hands, take the Ring for his own and the world will fall.
GALADRIEL (V.O.) It is close now, so close to achieving its goal.
[Faramir and company have reached Henneth Annun.
Frodo and Sam and being carries, blinded-folded into the cave.]
GALADRIEL (V.O.) For Sauron will have dominion of all life on this Earth, even unto the ending of the world.
GALADRIEL (V.O.) The time of the Elves is over.
[Close-up of Galadriel's luminous eyes with their deep pools of wisdom.
We then see Elrond in his library, looking at the painting of Isildur facing down Sauron with the broken blade of Narsil.]
GALADRIEL (V.O.) Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
GALADRIEL (V.O.) Do we let them stand alone?
[Scene returns to Henneth Annun.
Faramir is conferring with his man.
They unroll a map.]
FARAMIR What news?
MADRIL Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
MADRIL Theoden?s people have fled to Helm?s Deep.
MADRIL [Points at the map] But we must look to our own borders.
MADRIL Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
MADRIL Sauron is marshalling an army.
MADRIL Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate.
FARAMIR How many?
MADRIL Some thousands.
MADRIL More come every day.
FARAMIR Who?s covering the river to the north?
MADRIL We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but if the city is attacked, we won?t hold it.
FARAMIR [Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks from Isengard.
FARAMIR Sauron from Mordor.
FARAMIR The fight will come to men on both fronts.
FARAMIR Gondor is weak.
FARAMIR Sauron will strike us soon.
FARAMIR And he will strike hard.
FARAMIR He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
[The hobbits are unbound and blindfolds taken off them by Damrod and another ranger.
Sam and Frodo find themselves in a cave behind a waterfall, with Damrod sitting behind them on a rock constantly watching them.
Faramir comes up to them and sits.].
FARAMIR My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
SAM Spies?!
SAM Now wait just a minute!
FARAMIR Well if you?re not spies, then who are you?
[Frodo and Sam remain silent.]
FARAMIR Speak.
FRODO We are hobbits of the Shire.
FRODO Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
FARAMIR Your bodyguard?
SAM His gardener.
FARAMIR And where is your skulking friend?
FARAMIR That gangrel creature.
FARAMIR He had an ill-favoured look.
FRODO [The merest hesitation.] There was no other.
[Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.]
FRODO We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
FRODO One we lost in Moria.
FRODO Two were my kin.
FRODO A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf.
FRODO And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
FARAMIR [Intently] You?re a friend of Boromir?
FRODO Yes...
FRODO for my part.
FARAMIR It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
FRODO [Shocked] Dead?
FRODO How?
FRODO When?
FARAMIR As one of his companions, I?d hoped you would tell me.
FARAMIR [Pause] He was my brother.
[Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought.
Suddenly someone comes up to him.]
Captain Faramir.
[whispers] We found the third one.
[Frodo and Sam are sleeping.
Frodo awakens as Faramir stands before him.]
FARAMIR You must come with me.
FARAMIR Now.
[Frodo gets up and follow.
They come to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking the Forbidden Pool.]
FARAMIR [Pointing down] Down there.
[Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving into the water.]
FARAMIR To enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death.
FARAMIR [He gestures to archers hidden in the bushes.] They wait for my command.
[The Rangers notch their arrows]
FARAMIR Shall I shoot?
[Frodo looks stricken.
Gollum emerges from the pool onto a rock.
He holds a fish in his hand and starts singing, slapping the fish on the rock as he goes.]
GOLLUM [singing] The rock and pool is nice and cool, so juicy sweet!
GOLLUM I only wish [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet!
GOLLUM [The fish almost wriggles out of his grasp and he whacks it some more.]
[Faramir has his hand raised to order his men to shoot.
At the last moment, Frodo calls out.]
FRODO Wait!
FRODO [Faramir stops] This creature is bound to me.
FRODO And I to him.
FRODO He is our guide.
FRODO Please, let me go down to him.
[Faramir nods.
Frodo descends to the Forbidden Pool and approaches Gollum who is gorging on the raw fish.]
FRODO Smeagol.
FRODO [Gollum turns round at Frodo?s voice.] Master is here.
FRODO Come, Smeagol.
FRODO Trust master.
FRODO Come!
[Frodo gestures for Gollum to follow him.]
GOLLUM We must go now?
FRODO Smeagol, you must trust master.
FRODO Follow me, come on.
FRODO Come.
FRODO Come, Smeagol.
FRODO Nice Smeagol.
FRODO That?s it.
FRODO Come on.
[With the fish between his teeth, Gollum follows Frodo warily.
Suddenly he looks up in alarm and is caught by Rangers.]
FRODO Don?t hurt him!
FRODO Smeagol don?t struggle!
FRODO Smeagol listen to me!
GOLLUM [wails] Master!!
[A black cloth is brought over Gollum's head.
Frodo stares after them with a stricken expression as Faramir leads Gollum and his men away.
Back in the cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground.
Crying, he crawls into a corner and curls up into ball.]
GOLLUM No!
GOLLUM No!
FARAMIR Where are you leading them?
FARAMIR Answer me!
GOLLUM [Cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder] Smea gol...
GOLLUM Why does it cry, Smeagol?
SMEAGOL [Sobbing] Cruel men hurts us.
SMEAGOL Master trickst us.
GOLLUM Of course he did.
GOLLUM I told you he was tricksy.
GOLLUM I told you he was false.
SMEAGOL [Sobbing] Master is our friend...
SMEAGOL our friend.
GOLLUM Master betrayed us.
SMEAGOL No, not its business.
SMEAGOL Leave us alone!
GOLLUM [Hits his fist against the wall] Filthy little hobbitses.
GOLLUM They stole it from us.
SMEAGOL [Whimpers] No...
SMEAGOL No!
FARAMIR What did they steal?
GOLLUM [Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression] Myyy PRECIOUSSS!!
GOLLUM [He bares his teeth and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!
[Back in their holding area, Sam and Frodo are alone.]
SAM We have to get out of here.
SAM You go.
SAM Go, now!
SAM You can do it.
SAM Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
SAM Just this once.
SAM Put it on.
SAM Disappear.
FRODO I can?t.
FRODO You were right, Sam.
FRODO You tried to tell me, but I?m sorry.
FRODO The Ring?s taking me Sam.
FRODO If I put it on, he?ll find me.
FRODO He?ll see.
SAM Mr. Frodo...
[They both stand as Faramir enters.]
FARAMIR [Unsheathes his sword] So...
FARAMIR this is the answer to all the riddles.
FARAMIR Here in the wild I have you.
FARAMIR Two halflings and a host of men at my call.
FARAMIR The Ring of power within my grasp.
[Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo's neck with the tip of his sword.]
FARAMIR A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
[Frodo is backed up fearfully against the wall.
The Ring whispers and Frodo falls into a trance.
Suddenly, he grabs the Ring in his hand and jerks himself away.]
FRODO No!!
FRODO [He runs away from Faramir]
SAM Stop it!
SAM Leave him alone!
SAM Don?t you understand?
SAM He?s got to destroy it.
SAM That?s where we?re going.
SAM Into Mordor.
SAM To the mountain of fire.
[Faramir stares at Frodo.
Just then Damrod enters.]
DAMROD Osgiliath is under attack.
DAMROD They call for reinforcements.
SAM Please.
SAM It?s such a burden.
SAM Will you not help him?
DAMROD Captain?
FARAMIR Prepare to leave.
FARAMIR The Ring will go to Gondor.
FARAMIR [He turns to leave.]
FARAMIR [Aragorn is riding towards Helm?s Deep.
FARAMIR On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-hai army marching with great speed.
FARAMIR He quickly makes haste towards Helm?s Deep and soon sees the refuge.]
ARAGORN [Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nin.
ARAGORN [He rides into Helm?s Deep to the amazement of all.]
REFUGEES He?s alive!
GIMLI [Pushing his way through the crowd.] Where is he?
GIMLI Where is he?
GIMLI Get out of the way.
GIMLI I?m gonna kill him!
GIMLI [He sees Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew!
GIMLI [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless you, laddie!
ARAGORN Gimli, where is the king?
[Gimli gestures to the hall.
As Aragorn makes his way in, he runs into Legolas who stands waiting.]
LEGOLAS Le ab-dollen.
LEGOLAS Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorn?s wounds.] You look terrible.
LEGOLAS [To the side, Eowyn sees Aragorn and smiles joyously and with relief.
LEGOLAS Legolas takes Aragorn?s hand and gives the Evenstar pendant.
LEGOLAS Aragorn looks at the Evenstar and claps Legolas on the shoulder.]
ARAGORN Hannon le.
ARAGORN [Eowyn looks on and smiles even as tears fill her eyes.]
[Aragorn is in the keep, conferring with Theoden]
THEODEN A great host, you say?
ARAGORN All Isengard is emptied
THEODEN How many?
ARAGORN Ten thousand strong at least.
THEODEN Ten thousand?!
It is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men.
They will be here by nightfall.
THEODEN Let them come!
THEODEN [Walks away resolutely]
[Along the passage behind the Deeping Wall.]
THEODEN [to Gamling] I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
[Gamling nods and goes off.
Theoden stands at the gate of Helm?s Deep, speaking to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.]
THEODEN We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
THEODEN No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg.
GIMLI This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
GIMLI These are Uruk-hai.
GIMLI Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
THEODEN I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
THEODEN I know how to defend my own keep.
[Gimli seems miffed.
Legolas claps a hand on Gimli?s shoulder as he follows Aragorn and Theoden back in.]
THEODEN They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
THEODEN Saruman?s hordes will pillage and burn, we?ve seen it before.
THEODEN Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt.
THEODEN Within these walls, we will outlast them.
ARAGORN They do not come to destroy Rohan?s crops or villages.
ARAGORN They come to destroy its people.
ARAGORN Down to the last child.
THEODEN [Draws close to Aragorn] What would you have me do?
THEODEN Look at my men.
THEODEN Their courage hangs by a thread.
THEODEN If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
ARAGORN Send out riders, my lord.
ARAGORN You must call for aid.
THEODEN And who will come?
THEODEN Elves?
THEODEN Dwarves?
THEODEN We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
THEODEN The old alliances are dead.
ARAGORN Gondor will answer.
THEODEN Gondor?
THEODEN Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
THEODEN Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
THEODEN Where was Gon ? No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.
THEODEN [He walks away, calling out orders] Get the women and children into the caves.
GAMLING We need more time to lay provisions for a siege, lord ?
THEODEN [Cutting him off] There is no time.
THEODEN War is upon us!
[to the soldiers] Secure the gate!
[Men rush to prepare for battle as flocks of carrion crows circle overhead.]
[Treebeard walks through the forest carrying Merry and Pippin.
He comes to a clearing and stops.]
TREEBEARD We Ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time.
TREEBEARD But now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age...
TREEBEARD Ent Moot.
MERRY What?s that?
TREEBEARD 'Tis a gathering.
MERRY A gathering of what?
[Merry and Pippin turns round as they hear movement from the forest around them.
They see many more Ents like Treebeard gathering.]
TREEBEARD Beech, oak, chestnut, ash...
TREEBEARD Good, good, good.
TREEBEARD Many have come.
TREEBEARD Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
TREEBEARD [Back at Helm?s Deep, the women and children are being led into the caves.]
SOLDIER 1 Move back!
SOLDIER 1 Move to the caves!
SOLDIER 2 Keep moving!
SOLDIER 3 Quickly now!
[Old men and young lads are being drafted for war.
The women and children say their tearful and reluctant farewells as their fathers, husbands and sons are led away by soldiers.
In the armoury, weapons are being distributed.
Aragorn picks up a battered sword, looks at it and tosses it back.]
ARAGORN Farmer, farriers, stable boys.
ARAGORN These are no soldiers.
GIMLI Most have seen too many winters.
LEGOLAS Or too few.
LEGOLAS Look at them.
LEGOLAS They?re frightened.
LEGOLAS I can see it in their eyes.
LEGOLAS [The men around them fell silent.
LEGOLAS Legolas speaks to Aragorn.] Boe a hun: neled herain dan caer menig!
LEGOLAS (And they should be...
LEGOLAS Three hundred against ten thousand!)
ARAGORN Si beriathar hyn.
ARAGORN Amar na ned Edoras.
LEGOLAS Aragorn, men i ndagor.
LEGOLAS Hyn u-...
LEGOLAS ortheri.
LEGOLAS Natha daged aen!
LEGOLAS (Aragorn, we are warriors.
LEGOLAS They cannot win this fight.
LEGOLAS They are all going to die!)
ARAGORN Then I shall die as one them!
ARAGORN [He pauses and then walks away.
ARAGORN Legolas makes as if to go after him.]
GIMLI [Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go, lad.
GIMLI Let him be.
[In the hall]
GAMLING Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
GAMLING My lord?
THEODEN Who am I, Gamling?
GAMLING You are our king, sire.
THEODEN And do you trust your king?
GAMLING [Puts armour onto Theoden] Your men, my lord, will follow you to whatever end.
[The villagers are handed their weapons.
An oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed boy.
Another stares at the axe that he is handed with frightened eyes.
Another child wearing oversized chain mail takes up a huge shield.
Theoden stands inside the main hall of the keep, his back to the entrance where a bright white light is streaming through.]
THEODEN To whatever end Where is the horse and the rider?
THEODEN Where is the horn that was blowing?
THEODEN They have passed like rain on the mountains.
THEODEN Like wind in the meadow.
THEODEN The days have gone down in the west.
THEODEN Behind the hills, into shadow.
THEODEN How did it come to this?
[Everyone is getting ready for war at the battlements.
Aragorn is sitting on the steps.
He sees a young lad in armour holding a sword looking around nervously.]
ARAGORN Give me your sword.
ARAGORN What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless..
[Aragorn gives the battered sword a few swings.]
ARAGORN This is a good sword, Haleth, son of Hama.
[He hands the sword back to Haleth and leans close to him, putting a hand on his shoulder.]
ARAGORN There is always hope.
[Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his battle gear.
His sword is handed to him as he reaches for it.
He nods and accepts the sword from Legolas.]
LEGOLAS We have trusted you this far.
LEGOLAS You have not led us astray.
LEGOLAS Forgive me.
LEGOLAS I was wrong to despair.
ARAGORN U-moe edhored, Legolas.
ARAGORN [They smile and clap one another on the shoulders.
ARAGORN They look at Gimli as he walks up to them, struggling with his chain mail.]
GIMLI If we had more time I?d get this adjusted.
GIMLI [He drops the bundle and the chain mail lands with its length right to the floor.] It?s a little tight across the chest.
[Aragorn and Legolas bite back smiles.
Just then, a horn sounds in the background]
LEGOLAS That is no Orc horn.
LEGOLAS [They run out to the battlements.]
[The guards look down in wonderment.]
[to another guard] Send for the king.
Open the gate!
SOLDIER Open the gate!
[An army of Lothlorien Elves march up the Causeway into the Hornburg.
They are led by Haldir.
The Rohirrim soldiers look upon them in wonderment and delight as they pass.]
THEODEN How is this possible?
HALDIR I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
HALDIR An alliance once existed between Elves and men.
HALDIR Long ago we fought and died together.
HALDIR [He looks up to see Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli running down the steps, and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.
ARAGORN [He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir.
ARAGORN (Welcome, Haldir) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace.
ARAGORN Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back lightly.]
ARAGORN You are most welcome!
[Legolas and Haldir clasp each other on the shoulder.]
HALDIR [Turning to Theoden] We are proud to fight alongside men, once more.
[Men and Elves are in their positions on the battlements of Helm?s Deep.
The sounds of a marching army move closer and closer.
The women and children in the caves hear the sounds overhead and are frightened.
Mothers draw their children close and try to sooth crying babies.
The men and Elves look out into the darkness, lit by the thousands of torches carried by the huge advancing Uruk-hai army and the light bouncing off their armour.
With a row of Elf archers, Gimli is standing beside Legolas behind a wall, only the top of his helmet visible.]
GIMLI [Grumbling and straining to look above the wall.] You could have picked a better spot.
[Legolas smirks.
Aragorn approaches and stands beside them]
GIMLI Well lad, whatever luck you live by, let?s hope it lasts the night.
[Thunder sounds and lightning flashes, revealing the sea of approaching Uruk-hai.]
LEGOLAS Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
GIMLI Let?s hope they last the night.
GIMLI [Aragorn is giving commands to the Elf warriors.]
ARAGORN A Eruchin, u-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas!
ARAGORN (Show them no mercy!
ARAGORN For you shall receive none!)
[The Uruk-hai leader raises his swords and commands his army to stop with a terrifying animalic cry.
The Uruks stop and growl in anticipation of the upcoming battle and slaughter]
GIMLI [Jumping and straining to see] What?s happening out there?
LEGOLAS Shall I describe it to you?
LEGOLAS [Looks at Gimli with a grin] Or would you like me to find you a box?
GIMLI [Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!!
[The Uruk Leader cries out once, encouraging the Uruk-hai to start roaring and thumping their spears furiously.The women and children in the caves huddle together in fear.
Suddenly, Aldor, the old man next to Haleth, loses his grip and releases his arrow prematurely, shooting an Uruk-hai in the neck.]
ARAGORN Dartho!
ARAGORN [The Uruk-hai army stop their roaring and thumping.
ARAGORN With a hollow groan, the Uruk that was shot collapsed to the ground.
ARAGORN The other Uruk-hai bare their teeth and roar with anger.
ARAGORN With a cry, the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts charging.]
THEODEN So it begins.
ARAGORN Tangado halad!
ARAGORN [The Elves notch their arrow and aim.]
LEGOLAS Faeg i-varv din na lanc a nu ranc.
ARAGORN Leithio i philinn!
ARAGORN [Arrows rain down on the Uruk-hai below, killing many.]
GIMLI Did they hit anything?
THEODEN Give them a volley.
GAMLING [to the men] Fire!
Fire!
[More arrows are released.
But the Uruk-hai army keep advancing, with more replacing those fallen.]
ARAGORN Fire!
GIMLI [Impatiently] Send them to me!
GIMLI C?mon!
[The Uruk-hai start to load ladders onto the walls, pushing them up with their long spears.]
ARAGORN Pendraid!
ARAGORN [The Elves draw their blades in preparation for combat.
ARAGORN The first ladders are almost reaching the walls with big nasty Uruk Berserkers on top of them.]
ARAGORN Swords!
ARAGORN Swords!
GIMLI Good!
[Close combat begins as the Uruk-hai climb over the wall.]
GIMLI Legolas, two already!
GIMLI [Holding up two fingers]
LEGOLAS I?m on seventeen!
GIMLI [Outraged] Argh!
GIMLI I?ll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
GIMLI [He turns to a Uruk just climbing over the wall, whacking it in the groin with his axe and killing it as it falls.]
LEGOLAS [Fires two arrows] Nineteen!
[The Ent Moot is still in progress.
The Ents sway a little as they continue to deliberate.
Merry and Pippin are sitting a distance away.
Suddenly, Treebeard nods and turns to the hobbits.]
PIPPIN [Gesturing] Merry!
TREEBEARD We have just agreed.
TREEBEARD [Long pause with his eyes closed.]
MERRY [Angles his head in query] Yes?
TREEBEARD I have told your names to the Ent moot and we have agreed ? you are not Orcs.
PIPPIN Well, that?s good news.
MERRY [impatiently] And what about Saruman?
MERRY Have you come to a decision about HIM?
TREEBEARD [Waving a hand] Now don?t be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
MERRY Hasty?
MERRY Our friends are out there!
MERRY They need our help!
MERRY They cannot fight this war on their own.
TREEBEARD War, yes It affects us all.
TREEBEARD But you must understand, young hobbit.
TREEBEARD It takes a loong time to say anything in ooold Entish.
TREEBEARD [Merry and Pippin roll their eyes in disgruntlement.] And we never say anything unless it is worth taking a looong time to say.
[Gimli is standing on the wall between two ladders, hacking away at Uruk-hai as they come up]
GIMLI Seventeen!
GIMLI Eighteen!
GIMLI Nineteen!
GIMLI Twenty!
GIMLI Twenty-one!
GIMLI Twenty-two!
[Camera pans over the Uruk-hai below and turns to the Causeway.
A group of Uruk-hai is advancing on the Causeway towards the gate in tortoise formation, using their broad shields to block off attacks.]
ARAGORN Na fennas!
ARAGORN [The Elf archers release their arrows.
ARAGORN The Uruk-hai at the sides are shot and fall down the Causeway.
ARAGORN But the column keeps advancing.]
THEODEN Is this it?
THEODEN Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
[At the bottom of the Deeping Wall, two spiky bombs are lodge in the sluice gate.
The rest opens a path and an Uruk-hai carrying a torch starts to run towards the sluice gate.
Aragorn spots the Uruk-hai.]
ARAGORN Togo hon dad, Legolas!
ARAGORN [Legolas shoots the Uruk again.
ARAGORN It stumbles and then throws it self and the torch at the bombs.
ARAGORN An enormous explosion is set off, blowing away a large part of the wall.
ARAGORN Rock, debris and bodies are thrown up.
ARAGORN Aragorn is also thrown back by the force of the explosion and on the ground, knocked out.
ARAGORN Theoden looks on in shock as the Uruk-hai streams in past the Deeping Walls.]
THEODEN Brace the Gate!
THEODEN Hold them!
THEODEN Stand firm!
[Gimli sees the Uruk-hai charging in with Aragorn in their path.
With a cry, he jumps down from the wall and lands on the Uruk-hai army, taking them out as he stands.]
GIMLI Aragorn!!
GIMLI Argh!
[He is soon overpowered.
Aragorn gets up and sees Gimli falling.]
ARAGORN Gimli!
ARAGORN [He yells to the Elves behind him] Hado i philinn!
ARAGORN [The arrows take out the first group of Uruk-hai coming through the hole in the wall.]
ARAGORN Herio!
ARAGORN [Aragorn leads the Elves in a charge towards the Uruk-hai streaming in.
ARAGORN He rushes to Gimli?s side and picks him up.
ARAGORN At the top of the battlements, Legolas grabs a shield and sends it sliding across the ground.
ARAGORN He then hops onto it and surfs down the steps, releasing three arrows as he goes, and kicking the shield to stab an Uruk-hai as he lands at the bottom.]
[At the Ent Moot]
TREEBEARD The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
TREEBEARD We must weather such things as we have always done.
MERRY How can that be your decision?!
TREEBEARD This is not our war.
MERRY But you're part of this world!
MERRY Aren?t you?!
MERRY [The Ents look at one another, taken back] You must help, please!
MERRY You must do something!
TREEBEARD You are young and brave, Master Merry.
TREEBEARD But your part in this tale is over.
TREEBEARD Go back to your home.
[Merry is putting on his jacket.
Pippin approaches him slowly]
PIPPIN Maybe Treebeard?s right.
PIPPIN We don?t belong here, Merry.
PIPPIN It's too big for us.
PIPPIN What can we do in the end?
PIPPIN We've got the Shire.
PIPPIN Maybe we should go home.
MERRY [Looking into the distance.] The fires of Isengard will spread.
MERRY And the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
MERRY And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
MERRY [Turns to Pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder] There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
[Pippin looks after Merry as he walks away.]
GAMLING Aragorn!
GAMLING Fall back to the Keep!
GAMLING Get your men out of there!
ARAGORN Na Barad!
ARAGORN Na Baraad!
ARAGORN Haldir, na Barad!
ARAGORN (To the Keep!
ARAGORN Pull back to the Keep!
ARAGORN Haldir, to the Keep!)
[Haldir nods and turns back.
Gimli is being carried away, kicking and struggling as he goes]
GIMLI [Protesting] What are you doing?
GIMLI Argh!
GIMLI What are you stopping for!
With a grimace, he kills the Uruk-hai and looks down as his wound in seeming disbelief.
An Uruk-hai comes up from behind him unnoticed and slices him on the neck.
As Haldir goes down, he looks around him and sees his kin fallen among dead Uruk-hai.]
ARAGORN [Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!!
ARAGORN [He runs up the steps to Haldir?s side and catches him and he collapses.
ARAGORN Haldir's head rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing.
ARAGORN Aragorn bows his head in grief.
ARAGORN Then with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and swings down to the ground, killing as he goes.]
GAMLING Brace the gate!
SOLDIER Hold them!
THEODEN [Drawing his sword] To the gate!
THEODEN Draw your swords!
[Theoden and his commanders come to the gate, which is under heavy attack.
The Uruk-hai are knocking down the gate and hacking through the broken wood.
Theoden stabs at an Uruk-hai and receives a lance in his shoulder, blocked by his armour.
Grimacing in pain, Theoden continues to stab at the Uruk until led away by Gamling.]
GAMLING Make way!
GAMLING We cannot hold much longer.
THEODEN Hold them!
ARAGORN [Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-hai through the broken gate] How long do you need?
GAMLING Brace the gate!
THEODEN As long as you can give me!
ARAGORN Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the Gate!
[Aragorn and Gimli slip out a side exit and stand on a ledge just to the side of the main gate.
Aragorn peeks over, seeing the large band of Uruk-hai storming the gate.]
GIMLI Come on!
GIMLI We can take ?em!
ARAGORN It?s a long way.
[Gimli takes a peek and then steps back.]
GIMLI [Mumbles] Toss me.
ARAGORN What?
GIMLI I cannot jump the distance!
GIMLI You?ll have to toss me!
[Aragorn nods slowly and then turns to grab the Dwarf.]
GIMLI Oh!
GIMLI [Gimli stays Aragorn?s hand] Don?t tell the Elf.
ARAGORN Not a word.
[He tosses Gimli to the head of the Causeway and then leaps over.]
GIMLI [Making quick work of killing the Uruk-hai]
[On the other side of the gate]
THEODEN Shore up the door!
SOLDIER 1 Make way!
SOLDIER 2 Follow me to the barricade.
SOLDIER 3 Watch our backs!
Throw another one over here!
THEODEN Higher!
[Men are bracing the gate with wood and nails.
Aragorn and Gimli continue to fight off the Uruk-hai just outside.
Meanwhile the Uruk-hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements.
Hundred of Uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls, the super-ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips.
Legolas takes aim as another super-ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes.
The ladder falls back onto the Uruk-hai army.]
SOLDIER Hold fast the gate!]
THEODEN [Through a crack in the gate] Gimli!
THEODEN Aragorn!
THEODEN Get out of there!
[Legolas calls to them from the top of the battlements]
LEGOLAS Aragorn!
LEGOLAS [He throws them a rope]
[Aragorn grabs Gimli in one hand and the rope with the other as they are pulled up the wall.
Just then the Uruk-hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements.
Hundred of Uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls, the super-ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips.
Legolas takes aim as another super-ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes.
The ladder falls back onto the Uruk-hai army.]
THEODEN Pull everybody back!
THEODEN Pull them back!
GAMLING Fall back!
GAMLING Fall back!
THEODEN They?ve broken through!
THEODEN The castle is breached.
THEODEN Retreat!
GAMLING Fall back!
THEODEN Retreat!
ARAGORN Hurry!
ARAGORN Inside!
ARAGORN Get them inside!
GAMLING Into the Keep!
GAMLING [Treebeard is walking through the forest, carrying Merry and Pippin.
GAMLING The hobbits look dejected.]
TREEBEARD I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
TREEBEARD You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
[Pippin suddenly looks up with a gleam in his eyes.]
PIPPIN Wait!
PIPPIN Stop!
PIPPIN Stop!
PIPPIN [Treebeard comes to a stop.] Turn around.
PIPPIN Turn around.
PIPPIN Take us south!
TREEBEARD South?
TREEBEARD But that will lead you past Isengard.
PIPPIN Yes.
PIPPIN Exactly.
PIPPIN If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
PIPPIN The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
PIPPIN It?s the last thing he?ll expect.
TREEBEARD Mmmm.
TREEBEARD That doesn?t make sense to me.
TREEBEARD But then, you are very small.
TREEBEARD Perhaps you?re right.
TREEBEARD South it is then.
TREEBEARD Hold on, little Shirelings.
TREEBEARD I always like going south.
TREEBEARD Somehow it feels like going down hill.
MERRY Are you mad?
MERRY We?ll be caught!
PIPPIN No we won?t.
PIPPIN Not this time.
[Faramir and company draws close to Osgiliath.]
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
FRODO [With tears in his eyes] The Ring will not save Gondor.
FRODO It has only the power to destroy.
FRODO Please, let me go.
[Faramir hesitates for a moment.]
FARAMIR Hurry.
FARAMIR [He presses them on]
FRODO Faramir, you must let me go!
FRODO [Treebeard, Merry and Pippin come to the southern edge of the forest.]
TREEBEARD And a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and they tickle me awfully.
TREEBEARD They?re always trying to get somewhere where they ? Oh!!
TREEBEARD [He sees the desolated landscape of tree stumps that used to be forested grounds] Many of these trees were my friends.
TREEBEARD Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
PIPPIN I?m sorry, Treebeard.
TREEBEARD [With tears in his eyes] They had voices of their own.
TREEBEARD [His gaze turns to the treeless Isengard and its smoking caverns] Saruman!
TREEBEARD A wizard should know better!
[He lets out a ferocious roar that echoes through the forest]
TREEBEARD There is no curse in Elvish, Entish or the tongues of men for this treachery.
TREEBEARD My business is with Isengard tonight.
TREEBEARD With rock and stone!
[Merry and Pippin turn around as they hear rumbles from the forest.
They see many Ents emerging and marching towards them]
MERRY Yes!
TREEBEARD Hoorarooom...
TREEBEARD Come my friends.
TREEBEARD The Ents are going to war.
TREEBEARD It is likely that we go to our doom.
TREEBEARD Last march of the Ents!
[Osgiliath is still under siege as Faramir and company arrives, dodging arrows and falling rocks.]
MADRIL Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
MADRIL Their numbers are too great.
MADRIL By nightfall we?ll be overrun.
[Frodo suddenly seems stricken]
SAM Mr Frodo!
FRODO It?s calling to him, Sam.
FRODO His eye is almost on me.
SAM Hold on, Mr. Frodo You'll be alright...
[Frodo sees that Sam is speaking to him but he hears nothing.
His senses are overcome.]
FARAMIR Take them to my father.
FARAMIR Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
FARAMIR A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
[Sam breaks away as they are being led away.]
SAM Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
SAM You want to know why your brother died?
SAM He tried to take the Ring from Frodo!
SAM After swearing an oath to protect him, he tried to kill him!
SAM The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
[A boulder crashes into a tower overhead and shatters it.
Suddenly, Frodo?s eyes roll up and he stares at Faramir strangely.]
SAM Mr Frodo?
FRODO [In a faraway voice] They?re here.
FRODO They?ve come.
FARAMIR [Looking up] NAZGUL!!
FARAMIR [He grabs the hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.] Stay here.
FARAMIR Keep out of sight.
FARAMIR [To his men] Take cover!
[Banners of the White Hand are flying from the battlements of Helm?s Deep.
The Hornburg is overrun with Uruk-hai.
Theoden and company are in the hall of the keep.]
THEODEN The fortress is taken.
THEODEN It is over.
ARAGORN [Carrying a table with Legolas to shore up the door of the hall] You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it!
ARAGORN They still defend it!
ARAGORN They have died defending it!
[In the Glittering Caves, the women and children cry in fear as they hear the battering ram banging on the door.]
They are breaking in!
ARAGORN Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
ARAGORN [There is no answer.] Is there no other way?
GAMLING There is one passage.
GAMLING It leads into the mountains.
GAMLING But they will not get far.
GAMLING The Uruk-hai are too many.
ARAGORN Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
ARAGORN And barricade the entrance.
THEODEN So much death.
THEODEN What can men do against such reckless hate?
ARAGORN [Pause] Ride out with me.
ARAGORN Ride out and meet them.
THEODEN [A light of determination shines in his eyes] For death and glory.
ARAGORN For Rohan.
ARAGORN For your people.
GIMLI The sun is rising.
[Aragorn looks up at a window to see faint light streaming through.
He recalls Gandalf's words.]
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
THEODEN Yes.
THEODEN Yes!
THEODEN The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep one last time!
GIMLI Yes!
GIMLI [Gimli runs up the steps to the horn of Helm Hammerhand]
THEODEN Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
THEODEN Fell deeds awake.
THEODEN Now for wrath!
THEODEN Now for ruin!
THEODEN And a red dawn!
[He mounts his horse and puts on his helmet.
The sound of the horn rumbles through Helm's Deep as Gimli blows with gusto.]
[Theoden leads the charge out of the keep into the Hornburg, slashing away at the Uruk-hai as they go.
Without pause, they storm out of the gate and down the Causeway, right into the column of waiting Uruk-hai.
In the midst of battle, Aragorn looks east and sees a white rider against the rising sun]
ARAGORN Gandalf.
GANDALF Theoden king stands alone.
EOMER [Coming up from behind] Not alone.
EOMER [He raises a hand] Rohirrim!!
[Riders move up behind Eomer.]
THEODEN [Looking to the east] Eomer!
EOMER To the king!
EOMER [The Ents are stomping over Isengard, swinging their huge limbs, throwing and stamping on Orcs and rolling huge boulders over the ground.
EOMER An Ent is pulled down with chains by some Orcs, who immediately jump on and hacks away at his wooden limbs.
EOMER Saruman rushes out onto the balcony of Orthanc and stares at the pandemonium in incredulity.
EOMER Merry and Pippin also throws stones at Orcs, their aims true.]
PIPPIN Yes!
TREEBEARD A hit.
TREEBEARD A fine hit!
[Two Ents rock a wooden structure and push it over into the caverns below, smashing against the rock.
Some Orcs fire flamed-tipped arrows at an Ent, setting him on fire.
Saruman continues to look about from his balcony, helpless.
Some Ents are now breaking away at a dam.]
TREEBEARD Break the dam!
TREEBEARD Release the river!
[The dam is broken and Saruman looks up to see the river rushing down the slope towards Isengard, washing away Orcs and wooden structures in its path.
MERRY Pippin, hold on!
MERRY [The hobbits tighten their hold on top of Treebeard]
TREEBEARD Hold on, little hobbits!
TREEBEARD [Frodo walks slowly away from the safe corner.
TREEBEARD Gondorian Rangers are still running about, defending their stations.]
SAM What are you doing?
SAM Where are you going?!
Frodo walks up some stairs and stands on a bridge.
A Nazgul on a Fell beast emerges in front of him.
Frodo stares at the Nazgul, fixated.
Feeling the call of the Ring, he holds it up.
Faramir watches the unfolding tableau from below.
As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his finger and the Nazgul flies closer and closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo over.
Faramir releases an arrow and shoots the Fell Beast.
Frodo and Sam roll down the stairs.
As they come to a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam in a death grip, yells and points Sting at his throat, his eyes livid with madness and anger that someone would try to take the Ring away.]
FRODO Aaarrgghh!!!
SAM [With tears running down his face] It?s me.
SAM It?s your Sam.
SAM Don?t you know your Sam?
[The madness fades and recognition returns to Frodo?s eyes.
He realises what he nearly did and is overcome.
Stumbling backwards, he collapses against a wall and Sting falls to the ground with a clang.
Sam gets up slowly.]
FRODO [Slowly and with despair] I can?t do this, Sam.
SAM [Getting up slowly] I know.
SAM It?s all wrong.
SAM By rights we shouldn?t even be here.
SAM But we are.
SAM [He stands and leans against a wall, looking out into the distance.] It?s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
SAM The ones that really mattered.
SAM Full of darkness and danger they were.
SAM And sometimes you didn?t want to know the end.
SAM Because how could the end be happy?
SAM [Images of the riders winning the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helm?s Deep] How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
THEODEN Victory!
THEODEN We have victory!
THEODEN [He raises his sword with a victorious cry]
SAM But in the end, it?s only a passing thing, this shadow.
SAM [The women and children welcome the men as they return.
SAM Eowyn runs up to Aragorn and embraces him, crying tears of relief.] Even darkness must pass.
SAM A new day will come.
SAM [Isengard is flooded.
SAM Merry and Pippin looks on from their perch on Treebeard.
SAM On the balcony, Saruman stumbles back into his chamber] And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.
SAM Those were the stories that stayed with you.
SAM That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why.
SAM But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
SAM I know now.
SAM Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn?t.
SAM They kept going because they were holding on to something.
FRODO What are we holding on to, Sam?
SAM There?s some good in this world, Mr.
SAM Frodo.
SAM And it?s worth fighting for.
[Standing in a corner, even Gollum seems moved.
Faramir walks over and comes to kneel in front of Frodo]
FARAMIR I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
MADRIL You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
MADRIL If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
FARAMIR Then it is forfeit.
FARAMIR Release them.
[Sam shakes the ranger?s hand from his shoulder.
Frodo looks up at Faramir with gladness.
Over in the realm of Rohan, Gandalf, Theoden and company ride to the top of a slope, looking towards the Mountain of Fire in the distance.]
GANDALF Sauron?s wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
GANDALF The battle for Helm?s Deep is over.
GANDALF The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
GANDALF All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits.
GANDALF Somewhere in the wilderness.
[Frodo and Sam are walking through the woods, away from Osgiliath.]
SAM I wonder if we?ll ever be put into songs or tales.
FRODO What?
SAM I wonder if people will ever say, ?let?s hear about Frodo and the Ring.? And they?ll say ?yes, that?s one of my favorite stories.
SAM Frodo was really courageous, wasn?t he, dad.? ?Yes, my boy, the most famousest of hobbits.
SAM And that?s saying alot.?
FRODO Huh, you left out one of the chief characters ? Samwise the Brave.
FRODO I want to hear more about Sam.
[Frodo turns to look at Sam.]
FRODO Frodo wouldn?t have got far without Sam.
SAM Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn?t make fun.
SAM I was being serious.
FRODO [smiling] So was I. [He turns to walk on]
SAM [Dreamily] Samwise the Brave.
SAM [He gives his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]
[Gollum is crouching a short distance away]
FRODO Smeagol!
SAM We?re not gonna wait for you.
SAM Come on!
SMEAGOL Master...
SMEAGOL Master looks after us.
SMEAGOL Master wouldn?t hurt us.
GOLLUM Master broke his promise.
SMEAGOL Don?t ask Smeagol.
SMEAGOL Poor, poor Smeagol.
GOLLUM Master betrayed us!
GOLLUM Wicked, tricksy, false.
GOLLUM We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
GOLLUM [Twists the branch of a tree] Kill him!
GOLLUM Kill him!
GOLLUM Kill them both.
GOLLUM And then we take the precious and we be the master.
SMEAGOL [Scuttles and hides behind a tree] The fat hobbit, he knows.
SMEAGOL Eyes always watching.
GOLLUM Then we stabs them out.
GOLLUM Put out his eyeses.
GOLLUM And make HIM crawl.
SMEAGOL [Bites on his finger and nods eagerly] Yes!
SMEAGOL Yes!
SMEAGOL Yes!
GOLLUM Kill them both.
SMEAGOL Yes!
SMEAGOL No no!
SMEAGOL [Backs away against a tree] It?s too risky, it?s too risky.
[He looks in the direction of the hobbits]
SAM Where?s he gone?
SAM Hey Gollum, where are you?
FRODO Smeagol?
GOLLUM [Softly and sinisterly] We could let HER do it.
SMEAGOL Yes.
SMEAGOL She could do it.
GOLLUM Yes, precious she could.
GOLLUM And then we takes it once they?re dead.
SMEAGOL Once they?re dead
GOLLUM Shh [He pops out from hiding in front of the hobbits.]
SMEAGOL Come on, hobbits.
SMEAGOL Long ways to go yet.
SMEAGOL Smeagol will show you the way.
[He turns to walk on, with Frodo and Sam following behind.]
GOLLUM Follow me.
[ Camera pans up over the forest and Ephel Duath to reveal the desolation of Mordor.
To the left of the frame is the glowing Eye of Sauron atop Barad-dur, and to the right of the frame is the fiery Mount Doom.
Three Fell Beasts circle the dark skies.
Lightning flashes as the scene fades to black.]
