OCEAN'S TWELVE
Written by
George Nolfi
After a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: A SINGLE, STRIPED TULIP, planted in a long row of other tulips.
A HAND reaches in and pulls the tulip from the ground.
We then cut to:
1A A BASKET of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it 1A is loaded with hundreds of other baskets.
The door of the truck is SHUT and we cut to:
1B The door of the truck OPENING to reveal that the tulips 1B are now boxed and crated.
A forklift moves the crates onto a wagon, which is driven by a MANNED CART across the biggest warehouse on the planet, the Bloenen Markt (CHECK THIS-- steven) in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
The cart and wagons we were following disappear into a maze of synchronized activity.
1C The cart arrives in the AUCTION ROOM, which is 1C constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply raked semi-circle, facing two giant, clock-shaped scoreboards that display the bids on the flowers being viewed.
The striped tulips fetch a very high price.
1D The carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated 1D sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity.
They end up on a truck heading for the airport.
1E The tulips are loaded onto a plane.
During the transatlantic flight, they sit nestled in the cargo hold.
1F The tulips are unloaded from the plane, driven across an 1F airport tarmac and loaded onto another plane.
1G The tulips are unloaded from the plane and loaded onto a 1G truck.
The truck drives through a small town and pulls into the back of a
A YOUNG MAN takes delivery of the flowers and carries them through the rear of the store to the display area up front.
We stay on the tulips as we hear the following conversation:
CUSTOMER Wow.
CUSTOMER How do they do that?
OWNER It's an accident.
OWNER It means the flower developed a virus early in the bulb stage.
OWNER The flaws create the unusual coloring.
CUSTOMER Can you arrange something for me with those?
OWNER Of course.
OWNER What kind of price range are you looking for?
Now we SEE the customer: TESS.
TESS Well, it's for my parent's anniversary.
TESS They don't know I'm coming.
TESS I just want it to be beautiful.
TESS Can you just do whatever you think looks best?
OWNER I'll need a few minutes.
TESS Take your time, please.
TESS And thank you.
The Owner moves toward a corner of the store where the flowers are arranged.
Tess walks around, looking at the rest of the store.
Tess looks out the window.
A black sedan is pulling up at the curb.
OWNER That should be some surprise.
TESS Which?
OWNER For your parents.
TESS Oh.
TESS Yes.
TESS I hope so.
One of the POWER TWINS gets out of the driver's side door and crosses in front of the car.
Tess starts moving away from the window.
OWNER Which one is it?
TESS I'm sorry?
OWNER Anniversary.
TESS Oh.
TESS Fortieth
OWNER Wow.
OWNER Okay.
OWNER I think I have an idea.
OWNER Something classic.
The Power Twin opens the rear passenger side door, revealing
Tess turns away from the window.
TESS Do you have a bathroom?
OWNER Straight back, on the left.
OWNER It's unisex.
TESS Thank you.
Tess scurries to the back.
OWNER It's unisex!
Tess flies past the bathroom and heads for the back door.
She pushes through it and runs right into Power Twin No.
2.
A nice place on the eastern seaboard.
We hear the faint sound of a phone ring.
Danny Ocean picks up the receiver, checks the caller ID.
He smiles and answers:
DANNY Miguel Diaz speaking.
Almost immediately, his expression clouds.
He looks at his watch.
DANNY (cont'd) Tess, Tess.
DANNY (cont'd) It's okay.
DANNY (cont'd) You remember what we talked about, if this happened?
DANNY (cont'd) All right.
DANNY (cont'd) Call me in twenty-four hours on that number.
He hangs up the phone and runs out of the house.
He doesn't take anything with him.
Danny runs out of the house and down the street, leaving his car in the driveway.
Tess, floral arrangement in her lap, sits in the car with Benedict.
BENEDICT The Baldwins.
TESS What about them?
BENEDICT We had dinner with them three years ago.
BENEDICT You talked about your parent's anniversary.
She says nothing.
BENEDICT (cont'd) I'm getting married next month.
TESS So am I.
A beat.
BENEDICT Well, I hope Danny is as good as he thinks he is.
BENEDICT A bouquet toss in prison can get pretty ugly.
Danny takes a safe deposit box out of a wall, He opens the box, revealing a CELL PHONE and some CASH.
Danny boards a train.
The landscape hurtles by.
We pan over to find Danny sitting next to the window.
We continue to pan and find REUBEN TISHKOFF seated next to a group of male commuters.
REUBEN I really think you're being too sensitive.
REUBEN She's crazy about you.
REUBEN I can tell.
REUBEN lies in a mud bath, his face covered with a dried exfoliating "mask" treatment.
There is a cigar in one hand and a cellphone in the other.
His eyes are closed to the sun.
REUBEN Joyce, she's ninety-two.
REUBEN I'm all she has left.
REUBEN The wheelchair thing was an accident, she's having some trouble with the joystick.
REUBEN I'll adjust it.
REUBEN I told you, when her mouth hangs open like that, that means she's happy.
REUBEN I am.
REUBEN When are you coming over?
REUBEN (cont'd) You're tired because you work too much.
REUBEN (cont'd) You don't have to work all the time.
REUBEN (cont'd) Don't you want to take a break?
REUBEN (cont'd) Those trays look so heavy.
REUBEN (cont'd) Of course.
REUBEN (cont'd) How could you ask that?
REUBEN (cont'd) Because when I heard you laugh, all my problems disappeared.
A SHADOW crosses over Reuben's face, and Reuben squints open one eye.
There, with the sun like an aura behind his head, is
Reuben is handed a bloody mary by the porter, who then continues on, bringing a glass of white wine to THE AMAZING
Yen swims a strong, steady freestyle.
Pull back to reveal that he is swimming in a 9' by 5' "Endless Pool" in his 15th floor Shanghai apartment.
A HAND MOVES INTO FRAME and turns off the water current.
Yen immediately slams into the end of his jacuzzi-sized pool.
He lifts his head out of the water to SEE the POWER TWINS standing "poolside."
He spits out a stream of invective, in Chinese.
The Power Twins look at each other.
Yen sets his magazine down and heads for the bathroom, where TURK and VIRGIL MALLOY are waiting in line.
TURK The opening doesn't work.
VIRGIL Duh.
TURK She shouldn't have the same dream as Franklin.
TURK He's the antagonist.
VIRGIL It was your idea.
TURK No it wasn't.
VIRGIL Well, it wasn't mine.
VIRGIL It couldn't be; it's too stupid.
TURK Why do you do that?
TURK why do you have to get personal?
VIRGIL It's not personal, it's a fact.
VIRGIL and TURK MALLOY, in GTX lycra yoga gear lead a class (mostly female) through the vinyassa.
The studio is mirrored on three sides.
TURK It's personal.
TURK You don't argue logically.
TURK You attack.
TURK Bring the right foot back even with the left, buttocks raised high....
TURK ...you have to have reasons, to support your argument...
TURK ...flattening the back so the body forms a triangle.
VIRGIL I can't listen to you anymore.
VIRGIL It makes me physically sick.
Turk looks to him, but also sees a GUY in the class staring at all of the women "raising their buttocks high".
He indicates this to Virgil, who goes over to the guy.
TURK Relax the crown of the head toward the floor.
TURK Draw the hips away from the hands, len--gthening the spine.
TURK And press the heels toward the floor.
Virgil steps on the guy's back and leans down to whisper in his ear.
VIRGIL This a serious class.
VIRGIL No pigs allowed.
VIRGIL Okay?
GUY Sorry.
TURK Virge.
Virgil stands up.
Benedict and the Power Twins are standing right behind him.
His expression changes as he sees them in the mirror.
The Malloys and Yen are still waiting for the bathroom.
TURK You're hallucinating.
VIRGIL Yeah, whatever, OJ.
Finally, the lock OPENS and RUSTY RYAN exits.
We follow him to his seat, where he puts on a pair of headphones.
Of molten metal bubbling in a small iron cask, a jeweler's cask.
MOVE to REVEAL a GARAGE filled mostly with cars in some state of restoration
FIND RUSTY as he painstakingly works on a new piece that is just BELOW FRAME.
Whatever it is, it is clearly getting to him.
He shakes his head; it's not right.
It's just not good enough.
Rusty glances at the digital thermometer attached to the cask of molten metal.
It reads: 736.18 degrees.
RUSTY You are kidding me.
Rusty glances in his rearview as he drives through the city talking on his cell phone.
He's keeping an eye on a white Cadillac that seem to be following him.
RUSTY 736.18 degrees Fahrenheit, Felix.
RUSTY I watched it.
FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.) Rusty.
FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.) What do you want from me?
Rusty turns a corner, then glances in his rearview again.
RUSTY I want what I paid for.
FELIX And that's what I sent.
RUSTY No, Felix, no.
RUSTY I paid for pure.
RUSTY And if my workshop were on top of Mount Everest it would be pure.
RUSTY But I'm at sea level, Felix, and at sea level it should liquefy at 736.95.
RUSTY If it's pure, that is.
RUSTY Which this isn't.
Rusty makes another turn.
A few seconds later, the Cadillac turns behind him.
FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.) Well, I didn't know you were going to liquefy it.
Rusty pulls to a stop light.
The Cadillac pulls up three cars behind him.
RUSTY Let me ask you something: When Christo calls his cotton supplier and asks for 100% cotton cloth, do you think his supplier sends him 98% cotton and 2% polyester and when that doesn't work, says to Christo, "Well, you should have told me you were going to wrap the coast of Australia"?
FELIX Who's Christo?
Rusty looks to the heavens.
RUSTY Felix, you're in a shame spiral.
RUSTY Have your assistant lose my number.
Rusty snaps his phone shut.
RUSTY (cont'd) My god.
Rusty looks into the rear view mirror and then slows the car to a stop.
He gets out of his car and slams the door shut.
He walks back to the Cadillac and knocks on the window.
It rolls down electronically to reveal Benedict.
RUSTY (contd) How long you gonna give us?
Rusty continues to listen to his headset.
We pan over to see FRANK CATTON seated opposite him.
The penthouse apartment.
It takes the entire floor and has a 360 degree view.
Right now, all of the furniture inside of it is being taken away by movers.
Frank enters frame.
BENEDICT Four weeks.
FRANK We stole that money fair and square.
FRANK You bought people off to find me.
FRANK You took advantage during an economic downturn, and made them say some shit they shouldn't have said.
FRANK It's not fair, it's not just, and it aint' cool.
A long beat.
Benedict stares back at him.
FRANK (cont'd) Did you hear what I just said?
BENEDICT I heard what you said, Frank.
BENEDICT Did you hear what I said?
BENEDICT Frank looks at Benedict and the Power Twins.
Frank takes us to Livingston.
Livingston performs a stand-up routine.
LIVINGSTON How many people here tonight were stupid enough to have children?
LIVINGSTON A few people raise their hands.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) Wow.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) No, seriously, that's great.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) I have a child.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) A daughter.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) She's five.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) They get to you, right?
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) Am I right?
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) Like emotionally.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) I mean, sometimes she'll turn to me with her little face and her little shiny eyes, and she'll say, "Daddy, please stop hitting me," and it just breaks my heart.'
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) People aren't sure what to make of this.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) I'm Livingston Dell.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) Thanks for listening.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) See you at ten.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) Livingston strides off stage as we see that he is at the Bellagio, in the lounge.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) Benedict and the Power Twins are waiting for him.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) Somehow he isn't surprised.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) I appreciate you letting me finish my run.
LIVINGSTON (cont'd) You've been very patient.
BENEDICT What can I say?
BENEDICT You're a funny guy.
Livingston takes us to Saul Bloom, reading the Racing Form.
All dark wood and oriental rugs.
MOVE across a row of oil paintings that flatter stodgy club members from the 1800s to the present.
Land on Saul, sitting in window light that mimics the aforementioned portraits.
SAUL What it is about horses?
SAUL I ask you.
SAUL Is it the strength?
SAUL The beauty?
SAUL The fearlessness?
SAUL The grace?
SAUL Of course.
SAUL But there's something else.
SAUL Something in the eyes.
The person with him nods.
SAUL (cont'd) Yes.
SAUL (cont'd) When I look into a horse's eyes, I can tell: This one's a winner.
A jacketed WAITER appears, holding a tray.
WAITER Excuse me, Mr. Bloom?
SAUL Yes?
WAITER There appears to be a problem with your card.
The waiter tips the tray to reveal Saul's credit card, which has been CUT INTO TINY PIECES.
Without missing a beat, he reaches for his wallet.
SAUL You take Visa?
WAITER I was acting on instructions from your business manager.
SAUL My business manager?
WAITER Mr. Benedict.
Saul leads us to Basher.
Basher is putting the finishing touches on a song.
A producer and engineer sit behind a huge mixing console.
It's good-- Basher's really got something going here.
Basher is leaning over a thick legal document, and Benedict is leaning over him.
The music has been turned off.
BENEDICT Look at it this way...Eugene....if the album goes platinum it'll cover what you owe.
BENEDICT And if the second one goes gold, that should cover the interest.
Basher takes us to Linus.
Linus looking from the front seat to the back, talking to Benedict.
LINUS I'm responsible for myself.
LINUS I have my own life and my own plans.
LINUS I've never asked for anything but a fair shake.
LINUS We make a deal, I stick to the deal.
He turns forward, thinking.
Then after a beat, he turns back to Benedict.
LINUS (cont'd) I just need to be absolutely clear that we have an understanding: If you contact my father, I'll kill myself, and you'll never get the rest of your money.
Benedict nods.
Linus turns forward and exhales, relieved.
Linus takes us back to Danny.
The train hurtles onward.
Reuben, Yen, the Malloys, Frank, Livingston, Saul, Basher, and Linus are all talking at once -- right at us.
Right at Danny.
And they are not happy.
The group is in an abandoned WAREHOUSE somewhere near NYC.
Danny is overwhelmed, like a deer caught in the headlights.
He throws a desperate glance at Rusty, who's looking out the window serenely, letting Danny flounder.
Total silence.
Everyone just stares at Danny, waiting for an answer.
DANNY How many can't make the deadline?
Everyone raises their hands except Reuben.
REUBEN So I'm smarter than those schmucks on Wall Street.
REUBEN Whose fault is that?
Fair enough.
DANNY How many think if they run, they'll be found?
Everyone raises their hands.
Including Reuben.
Danny gets up, walks over to Rusty.
The rest of the guys shrug and begin talking amongst themselves.
After a long beat.
DANNY (cont'd) Well, the only other--
RUSTY We're on the five o'clock.
DANNY Good.
A beat.
DANNY (cont'd) Where?
RUSTY Amsterdam.
Danny steps back.
Danny's tone draws everyone's attention.
Noticing this, Danny and Rusty move into a nearby dilapidated office doorway.
The guys go back to talking, mostly about what they were doing when they were found.
This rises steadily in volume until the din is obliterated by a LOUD VOICE:
The guys exchange glances.
Danny walks over to them and sighs.
Livingston hands his passport to a KLM AGENT.
LIVINGSTON Flight 144 to Amsterdam.
JUMP CUT TO the agent handing Livingston his boarding pass.
KLM AGENT You're in seat 43J.
KLM AGENT Enjoy your flight.
LIVINGSTON Uh...there must be some mistake.
LIVINGSTON I mean...unless...is your first class section in the back of the plane?
The agent looks back at him, confused.
KLM AGENT No.
JUMP CUT TO the agent handing Linus his boarding pass:
CUT TO the agent handing Virgil and Turk their tickets.
KLM AGENT (contd) 41C and D.
JUMP CUT TO the agent handing Saul his boarding pass:
SAUL Fifty-five K?
SAUL There's a fifty-five
KLM AGENT We've increased capacity by employing advanced design technology.
SAUL You made the seats smaller.
SAUL Can you just say that?
SAUL You made the seats smaller.
JUMP CUT to show Frank:
FRANK See, you're not hearing me.
FRANK What I'm trying to tell you is the reservations agent made a mistake when she issued the ticket, because on the rare occasions that I fly commercially, I always book a first- class ticket with no restrictions--
The desk agent looks back at him skeptically.
KLM AGENT She may have, air, but this is the only ticket available to you on this flight.
KLM AGENT I need you to step aside so I can take care of the next customer.
FRANK Now, listen: Don't make me get black.
Frank stands with his arm outstretched, shoes and belt off.
Two TSA officers run metal detecting wands over every inch of his body.
Three more guys pick through his luggage: they squeeze toothpaste from his Sensodyne tube, sniff his hair products, unroll his "tighty-whitey" briefs....
PAN to REVEAL that Basher is getting the exact same treatment, right next to him.
They exchange looks.
REVERSE ANGLE: the rest of the group stands sipping iced lattes from Starbucks and watching the show.
Reuben walks up.
DANNY Reuben.
REUBEN I wanted to wish you luck.
REUBEN And listen: I want to do something for you.
Reuben hands Danny an envelope.
DANNY What's this?
REUBEN Take it.
REUBEN Take it.
REUBEN This is the least I can do.
REUBEN I've got a friend who owns the Bellagio of Amsterdam and I've made reservations for all of you there.
REUBEN It's all taken care of.
RUSTY That's very touching, Reuben.
REUBEN It's the least I could do.
REUBEN I love you guys.
REUBEN Enjoy.
Yen says something in Chinese.
REUBEN (cont'd) No, thank you.
Yen sits in First Class, playing an in-seat video.
Virgil and Turk kneel on either side, watching his progress.
VIRGIL Nice.
TURK Great anticipation.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Gentlemen, you'll have to go back to your seats now.
Reluctantly, they do.
We follow them back to coach, where they pass Linus, talking to himself.
LINUS Ground level.
LINUS First floor.
LINUS Day one.
LINUS Planning stages.
LINUS Planning stages.
We move on to find Livingston, who grabs Turk by the arm.
LIVINGSTON How'd he get that seat?
TURK What seat?
Turk moves on, taking us past a sleeping Saul and landing on Danny and Rusty, who watch a movie with fixed expressions.
A reverse angle shows us that the video screen is twenty rows away--it is impossible to discern any detail at all.
Rusty takes his headphones off and exhales.
Danny notices this and does the same.
After a beat:
RUSTY Call me an elitist asshole, call me a bourgeois clown, call me anything you want, but 'economy' is bullshit.
DANNY Oh, I don't know...it's not that ba-
The guy in front of Danny moves his seat back suddenly and spills Danny's drink all over Danny's lap.
Linus approaches Danny and Rusty.
LINUS Hey.
LINUS You guys have a minute?
DANNY Sure, Linus.
RUSTY What's on your mind?
LINUS Well, I know this may not be the exact right time to bring this up, but I've been thinking about...well, about where I want to be in five years, career-wise, and I've decided I really want to be more than just a role-player.
LINUS I really see myself as kind of an idea man, like you guys.
LINUS I mean, I know you do your part and you're in the trenches with us and all, but it's really your show, and like I said, five years from now, I want to be running my own show....
Danny and Rusty exchange a look...then look back at Linus.
Uh-huh.
Right.
LINUS So if there's any opportunity for me to be involved in the, you know, planning stages of things, I would really appreciate it.
LINUS I really feel like I'm ready for more responsibility and that I could really make a contribution.
Rusty turns to Danny.
RUSTY Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
DANNY Evelyn.
RUSTY We're negotiating the terms with her tomorrow.
RUSTY You feel up to taking the lead?
LINUS Are you serious?
DANNY Absolutely.
LINUS This isn't some gag?
RUSTY No gag.
LINUS Wow.
LINUS Yeah.
LINUS That would be awesome.
DANNY Okay, then.
LINUS Man.
LINUS I wasn't sure if I should say anything.
LINUS Now I'm glad I did.
DANNY So are we.
RUSTY We're here to listen.
LINUS Great.
LINUS Thanks.
LINUS Really.
LINUS You won't regret this.
Linus leaves.
Danny and Rusty put their headphones back on.
Now they look content.
Basher and Frank watch Linus go.
BASHER Tom.
SAUL He can be a Tom?
BASHER Anybody can be a Tom.
SAUL You gotta make your own opportunities.
SAUL This ain't a rehearsal.
BASHER Tom.
Saul chews his economy class trail mix.
SAUL Boy, you're tough.
BASHER Stop calling me "boy".
Saul stops chewing.
They look at each other.
Establishing shots of the city.
The group makes their way down a damp cobblestone street.
They stop in front of a window and look up.
They have stopped in front of a narrow townhouse that has been converted to a hotel.
The sign says "Bellagio of Amsterdam."
A single room with 12 bunks in it.
Their noses are wrinkled up because the place stinks.
LIVINGSTON How could he lie to us like that?
RUSTY The sign said 'the Bellagio of Amsterdam'.
Everyone looks at each other and turns to leave.
LINUS (?) Wait a minute.
LINUS (?) That's it?
DANNY Yeah.
LINUS Look, you guys no frills, no perks, run-and-gun, all that stuff, and I said no problem because I believed you were right that we shouldn't go deeper into debt and spend money we don't have.
LINUS I mean, am I the only one who thinks this might actually be a good thing?
LINUS That we could use a little humility?
LINUS That maybe we were a little too pleased and impressed with ourselves after the Benedict job?
LINUS Okay, I grant you that maybe this isn't what we deserve, but maybe it's what we need.
LINUS We can do this.
LINUS No, I take it back: We have to do this.
A long beat.
Four black mercedes skid to a stop outside Amsterdam's finest five-star hotel.
Everyone emerges with big smiles on their faces.
Everyone except Linus.
He scowls, yanks his bag back from the hotel doorman who rushed over to take it for him.
Tess enters and buys a phone card.
Tess talks to Danny.
Across the street, a BLACK SEDAN is parked.
TESS What are you doing in Amsterdam?
DANNY (PHONE V.O) Only what I have to do to get Benedict off our backs.
TESS Be careful, Danny.
TESS Please.
DANNY How's work?
TESS It's the same.
TESS I'm distracted.
DANNY I'm sorry.
TESS It's not your fault.
DANNY (TELEPHONE V.O.) I keep trying to figure out what I did wrong.
DANNY (TELEPHONE V.O.) How did he find us?
Tess can't bring herself to tell Danny the truth, that it was entirely her fault.
TESS Danny, don't keep thinking about it.
DANNY (TELEPHONE V.O.) I did something wrong.
DANNY (TELEPHONE V.O.) He should never have found us.
TESS I'll call you tomorrow.
TESS I love you.
DANNY I love you.
Danny hangs up the phone and site.
In other rooms, the guys get themselves settled in.
Each takes a step toward personalizing their suite.
Danny and Rusty lead an obviously eager Linus towards a coffee house.
RUSTY She'll try and use her looks to distract you.
RUSTY Don't let her.
DANNY Be polite, but firm.
LINUS Right.
RUSTY Don't get soft on us.
RUSTY Don't make too many concessions.
LINUS I won't.
Danny and Rusty nod.
Okay.
Who is obviously a MAN IN DRAG.
Linus looks to Danny and Rusty but they give him nothing.
EVELYN The onset of summer is like a woman who owns too many shoes.
She/He looks to Linus, who looks to Danny and Rusty.
DANNY If animals were capable of flattery, the World Bank would be open until 8pm.
EVELYN When I was four years old, I saw my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy.
Again, the Evelyn looks to Linus, who has nothing to say.
RUSTY A doctor who specializes in skin diseases will dream that he has fallen asleep in front of the television.
RUSTY Later he will wake up in front of the television but not remember his dream.
Evelyn nods and looks to Linus, as do Danny and Rusty.
He furrows his brow, then speaks:
LINUS O let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dreams.
LINUS I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been.
Danny and Rusty stare at Linus like he's nuts, like he's just cracked.
Evelyn's entire expression changes.
EVELYN Your young friend has a great deal to learn about respect.
She/He puts his/her drink down and walks to another part of the establishment.
DANNY Linus...why don't you wait outside.
Rusty and Danny follow Evelyn and quietly console him/her.
Linus cools his heels.
Danny and Rusty emerge from inside.
DANNY Is that your idea of making a contribution?
RUSTY Her terms were scandalous.
RUSTY And we were lucky to get them after what you said.
DANNY The deal was this close to being blown.
LINUS "Deal?" What "deal?"
Danny and Rusty just look at him.
LINUS (cont'd) I know what you guys are doing.
Danny and Rusty exhange looks.
What?
LINUS (cont'd) Look.
LINUS (cont'd) That...person had too many cupcakes.
They just keep staring at him.
LINUS (cont'd) I was playing along.
RUSTY "Playing along!"
DANNY You called her mother a whore.
RUSTY A really cheap one.
LINUS Guys, I'm not falling for this.
LINUS I'm not....
But Danny and Rusty aren't laughing.
They look pissed.
Seriously pissed.
LINUS (cont'd) I mean...
Danny and Rusty just look at him.
Linus squirms.
LINUS (cont'd) I called her mother a whore?
Danny and Rusty explain the job to the group.
RUSTY It's a privately owned home.
RUSTY But don't let that fool you.
RUSTY It's extremely well-protected.
A photo of a four-story canal house is displayed on a flat screen connected to Livingston's computer.
SAUL What are we after?
DANNY A document.
DANNY A very old, very valuable document.
A photo labeled "The Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift" is displayed on screen.
VIRGIL What is it?
RUSTY A stock certificate.
DANNY The first one ever issued, from the first corporation on the planet.
DANNY The Dutch East India Trading Company.
DANNY It's the only one of it's kind and it's worth a boat-load.
TURK What's our cut?
RUSTY 2.7 million after expenses.
A beat.
Turk seems confused...
TURK Each?
VIRGIL Who negotiated this?
Danny and Rusty look at Linus,
LINUS Thanks.
LIVINGSTON What do we know so far?
DANNY There's a dummy key pad by the front door.
DANNY But the alarm is really controlled by the keypad in Mr.
DANNY Vanderspeigle's second floor office.
DANNY Now, here's good news: we already know the system's master code.
DANNY Evelyn gave it to us.
FRANK That's not good news, that's really good news.
VIRGIL We just wait until he leaves.
DANNY Yeah, well...that's the bad news.
RUSTY He doesn't.
Frank flinches.
Doesn't like what he's hearing.
DANNY He's agoraphobic.
Shots of their mark, Vanderspeigle, being an agoraphobic weirdo.
LIVINGSTON So he's never been out of his house?
LIVINGSTON Ever?
RUSTY (V.O.) Not once since he moved in ten years ago.
SAUL (V.O.) Doesn't this guy believe in fresh air?
RUSTY (V.O.) Cracks his windows at night...that's about it.
RUSTY (V.O.) When Vanderspeigle cracks his window we see that locking pins fall into place to prevent the window from opening more than a few inches.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) Can we tap into the system from the outside through the phone lines?
RUSTY (V.O.) Negative.
RUSTY (V.O.) It's a closed-loop system with two redundant servers locked into titanium cases in the guy's bedroom.
47A We SEE the servers in Vanderspeigle's bedroom.
47A
BASHER (V.O.) Could we use a remote device to trigger the panel?
DANNY (V.O.) It's hard-wired and shielded.
TURK Guys, am I missing something here?
TURK We know his damn code, right?
TURK You're telling me with that much information we can't find a way into this freak's house?
TURK Frank flinches again.
TURK He seem to be reacting to the term "freak."
TURK Can't we just get a telephone repair truck...
TURK (V.O.) ...put the basket up and use a telescoping rod through the open window to tap out the guy's code?
Turk's idea plays out as it is in his MIND'S EYE, until:
RUSTY (V.O.) The street in front of the house is blocked off to vehicles.
DANNY (V.O.) And it's covered by five independently-wired surveillance cameras....
RUSTY (V.O.) Monitored 24-hours a day by a security company.
We SEE the security arrangements they describe.
SAUL God, this guy really is a freak.
BASHER Crazy freak.
Frank reacts again to the term "freak."
It really bothers him.
Danny notices.
DANNY Something wrong?
FRANK Just...don't call the guy a freak, okay?
Everyone turns and looks at Frank like he's a freak.
FRANK (cont'd) What?
The entire room is staring at him.
FRANK (cont'd) What?!
FRANK (cont'd) I mean, am I the only one here who feels funny about stealing from a...a...handicapped guy?
Danny looks to one side of the room...then the other.
DANNY Yeah.
The rest of the room agrees.
Matter closed.
Everyone just turns back to what they're doing.
DANNY (cont'd) Okay, so we know what we can't do...
Frank stews.
DANNY (cont'd) Time to think outside the box, guys.
A beat.
Everyone thinks.
Then:
LINUS Okay, here's something...I've got an idea...suppose we--
RUSTY No.
LINUS Well, but how--
RUSTY There's a Goldmann Grid over the enitre surface.
Linus looks at him.
RUSTY (cont'd) Is that what you were thinking about?
Linus nods.
DANNY But....
RUSTY --Well, that's different.
RUSTY Especially if we--
Rusty makes a circular motion with his finger and then stops it with his other hand.
DANNY Right.
LINUS What?
RUSTY A Schuman Special.
RUSTY Livingston--
LIVINGSTON Absolutely.
LIVINGSTON I mean, I'd need a day to--
RUSTY You'll have three.
RUSTY Basher?
BASHER No worries.
RUSTY Virgil, Turk.
VIRGIL. Just gotta get the gear.
TURK Sweden.
RUSTY Yen?
Yen says something in Chinese.
RUSTY (cont'd) What, and give up show business?
RUSTY (cont'd) Saul--
SAUL I know, I know.
SAUL I'll be bored.
SAUL You'll be fine.
RUSTY Clock's running.
Everyone gets up and leaves.
Within seconds, Linus is alone, standing in the middle of the room.
LINUS What's a Schuman Special?
Livingston uses a mock up of the alarm panel as a visual aid.
LIVINGSTON Your shot has to hit directly above the keypad.
We see Basher rehearsing the shot.
He can't get a clear shot of the target.
In fact, he can't see it.
He turns to Saul.
BASHER Let me see the specs.
Saul pulls a well-worn copy of the alarm system blueprint.
Basher goes to the height of the alarm keypad in the bedroom.
It's 4' 10".
BASHER How tall is the surface of this roof?
SAUL About 87 feet.
BASHER How tall exactly?
Danny looks at a diagram of the safe they'll have to crack when they get inside Vanderspeigle's house, the safe that contains the "Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift".
Everyone but Linus and Rusty are here.
But then Rusty comes in.
RUSTY You're not going to believe this.
DANNY Try me.
RUSTY We don't have line-of-sight.
DANNY What?
RUSTY We tried everywhere.
RUSTY Some places we're only three or four inches off...but...there's no straight shot.
RUSTY Even with Basher.
RUSTY It's literally impossible.
Linus enters, out of breath.
Seeing everyone, he goes to Danny and Rusty.
LINUS Can I talk to you guys for a second?
They nod and allow Linus to pull them into the corner.
Linus looks over at the group and then turns to 'them.
LINUS Listen, I've done a little research on the Schuman Special, and uh...we don't have line of sight for the shot.
DANNY What?
RUSTY Jesus.
RUSTY This'll kill us.
DANNY Listen: Don't say anything.
DANNY If you're ever going to run your own crew, you've got to remember to never show weakness.
RUSTY It's like blood in the water for these guys.
DANNY If they think you're slipping, you won't even see it coming.
Linus swallows.
RUSTY But hey--thanks.
Linus nods and goes back to the group.
RUSTY I need some air.
Rusty and Danny walk along the adjacent road.
DANNY The Swinging Priest?
RUSTY Not enough time.
DANNY Crazy Larry.
RUSTY Too many variables.
DANNY Robinov's Revenge?
RUSTY Too many obstacles.
DANNY The Soft Shoulder.
RUSTY Not enough people.
DANNY Baker's Dozen.
RUSTY We'd need a woman.
DANNY Hell in a Handbasket.
RUSTY Can't train the cat that quickly.
DANNY I can't have my wife watch me hauled off in handcuffs again.
RUSTY It's always about you, isn't it?
DANNY This like running toward a cliff.
DANNY Speaking of which, how's Isabel?
RUSTY I have no idea what you're talking about.
DANNY You get the tattoo removed?
RUSTY Given its location, my doctor advised against it.
Rusty stops walking.
Danny continues, then notices he is alone.
He turns back to Rusty.
DANNY What are you doing?
RUSTY We're here.
DANNY Oh.
As Danny and Rusty enter the hotel, Rusty trips on the steps.
DANNY Nice.
Rusty bends down to look at the step.
He notices that one tile on the edge of the stop has lost some mortar.
He touches the tile and watches the lip rise up and down, up and down, as though it's cantilevered.
SAUL You want to do what?
REVERSE to REVEAL Rusty and Danny.
RUSTY Tilt it.
RUSTY Raise it slightly.
SAUL The whole house?
RUSTY It's only a few inches.
BASHER Then I'll have line-of-sight.
FRANK We can't tilt a whole house.
VIRGIL They did it with the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
RUSTY Exactly.
SAUL It took three hundred guys two years to do that.
SAUL You're crazy.
SAUL Nobody's ever done anything like this.
RUSTY Not true.
RUSTY Palowski did it in `64 in Venice and `73 in Istanbul.
SAUL Really?
LIVINGSTON And he only had a crew of six.
RUSTY There are thirty pylons.
RUSTY We cut them, insert the jacks, and crank.
BASHER For nineteen hours.
BASHER Here's the order in which they have to be done.
It is pouring rain.
From across the canal, we MOVE towards Vanderspeigle's house, favoring a barge moored just out front.
Then, instead of moving over the barge, we PUSH THROUGH its hull to--
FIND Frank and Livingston inside manning a series of industrial water pumps.
They're grimy and covered in sweat.
Rain drips through the deck above them.
LIVINGSTON So, Basher approached me about being on a crew.
FRANK When?
LIVINGSTON Yesterday.
Frank thinks about that.
Yen pops his head out from a small tube and says something in Chinese.
Frank shrugs...doesn't understand.
Yen tries again....
This time he enunciates very clearly and talks very loudly (like Americans do when foreigners don't understand English).
Frank nods, starts turning the handle of the water pump in the opposite direction.
Yen climbs down out of the tube.
Then he climbs back up the tube.
He picks up a jack in the corner.
Climbs back in the tube.
We FOLLOW him as he climbs through the tube and emerges underneath Vanderspeigle's house, inside its foundation.
The thirty pylons extend from the base of the house into the into the swamp it sits atop of.
There is little space between the swamp level and the house.
Runoff from the rain outside drips everywhere.
FIND Danny and Rusty struggling to place a hand-cranked jack into a freshly cut space in one of the timber pylons.
They are covered in muck and grime
RUSTY The good news is, after the first twelve hours, I stopped being able to smell anything.
DANNY Took a few more for me.
RUSTY This water was stagnant six hundred years ago.
FIND the Malloys, thirty feet away, using a fancy underwater saw to cut a space in another pylon.
Because the cutting is taking place underwater it is extremely quiet.
VIRGIL There's no reason for him not to.
VIRGIL He would go to the cops.
TURK Okay, so he goes to the cops.
VIRGIL Then they arrest Dominique.
TURK. Right.
VIRGIL Then we have no story.
TURK Right.
LINUS She steals the money from Mr.
LINUS Mulroney.
They turn to look at Linus, sawing nearby.
TURK What?
VIRGIL Why would she?
LINUS To pay Franklin to keep quiet.
Turk and Virgil think about that.
Linus keeps sawing.
TURK That's good.
Basher and Saul sit in big cushiony chairs.
SAUL Counterfeiting?
SAUL Me?
SAUL I have to tell you, it's not something I condone.
SAUL It's cheating.
BASHER It is cheating.
SAUL There's no subtlety to it.
BASHER It's kind of embarrassing.
SAUL No one I know...
BASHER I can't imagine anything like that.
A long beat.
Then each of them reach into their jackets and produce $20 bills.
They exchange and examine the bills closely by eye.
Satisfied, they trade them again and return them to their coat pockets.
SAUL Not bad.
BASHER Bolivia.
SAUL Diego's people?
BASHER Yeah.
SAUL Well.
SAUL Congratulations.
BASHER I told him about you.
SAUL I'm too old.
SAUL That's dangerous.
SAUL My stuff is cheap compared to that.
SAUL It's just me and my gal, you know.
SAUL What you're talking about is organized.
SAUL But thanks, anyway.
Frank sits watching TV.
Livingston enters with groceries.
FRANK Jay Leno called.
LIVINGSTON When are you gonna stop with that tired "white people can't be funny stuff"?
LIVINGSTON It's so old, Frank, really.
LIVINGSTON Do you want some orange juice?
LIVINGSTON I got the good kind.
Just then they are interrupted by Danny's voice on a walkie- talkie.
DANNY (V.O.) Augie One, this is Condor.
Rusty turns to Danny.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) This is Augie One; Go Condor.
DANNY (V.O.) We're fully cranked here.
DANNY (V.O.) Let's go to phase two.
Livingston and Frank look at each other.
FRANK Bring that orange juice.
Basher sets up his gear again.
This time, when he raises the crossbow to check his shot, HE CAN SEE THE KEYPAD.
Just barely.
He steadies himself.
Saul knows that he's ready to take the shot.
He speaks into a walkie talkie.
SAUL This is Gatsby.
SAUL We're green here.
Basher aims.
The INSTANT he fires the shot we
A MALE SECRETARY (HESS) rushes through Europol's extraordinary Richard Meier-designed headquarters.
Europol Agent ISABEL LAHIRI gives a presentation to seventy- five of her colleagues.
With her on stage are a couple of seated HIGHER-UP TYPES.
She's nervous.
ISABEL Let's discuss, briefly and to begin, with the category of "thieves", as distinguished from the larger category of what might be termed "hardened" criminals.
ISABEL The highest level, "master thieves," if you will, is a very small world.
ISABEL Between six and ten high-level crews are operating in Europe at any given time.
ISABEL Worldwide, no more than twenty.
ISABEL The most famous, Gaspar LeMarc, is either dead or retired, and the expectation is that no one will replace him.
ISABEL The good news is the trend is toward their extinction.
The secretary enters the auditorium and walks toward the podium.
ISABEL For example: Anecdotal evidence suggest these people are personally insufferable.
The Higher-Ups look at each other; what did she just say?
ISABEL Their egos demand constant praise, and they embellish their exploits to anyone who will listen.
ISABEL They tell their own stories endlessly, provided of course, they are talking to a fellow thief or an intimate.
Many in the audience are now looking to each other, wondering if this is appropriate.
ISABEL Those who interact with them on a personal level are relegated to positions of total servitude, with no chance for growth or freedom.
ISABEL Their lives are treated as secondary.
ISABEL Many of them suffer from depression.
ISABEL It's a crime for which there is no law, and yet causes untold damage.
One of the Higher-Ups convinces the other to say something, but by now Hess the Male Secretary has reached Isabel and interrupts her by whispering into her ear.
She balances.
Isabel and Hess walk briskly through the ultra-modern hallway.
He briefs her as they walk in a hushed voice.
Then something he says stops her in her tracks.
Hess continues to explain something we can't hear.
Then he pulls out some PHOTOS.
Isabel leafs through them.
ISABEL That's impossible!
Isabel arrives and is greeted by PAUL, a lead detective working the Vanderspeigle theft for the Amsterdam police department.
PAUL Thanks for coming.
PAUL We can really use your help on this one.
His partner looks over at Isabel, who is wearing a skirt and pretty damn good shoes.
The guy checks out her legs and looks away.
ISABEL I hope the scene hasn't been contaminated.
Isabel walks away.
Moments later, she enters the house with the lead detective.
As soon as she's inside she's all business.
ISABEL No forced entry.
PAUL Not that we can find.
Isabel looks around Vanderspeigle's home office.
Behind a fake bookcase is a small room which contains the safe.
In the other direction is Vanderspeigle's bedroom.
PAUL We can't figure out how they disabled the alarm.
PAUL We thought maybe they tried to short it out somehow.
ISABEL No, that would have triggered the system.
Isabel goes to the alarm pad.
Pulls the face plate off, examines the inside.
ISABEL (cont'd) And damaged the circuits.
PAM Well, then I don't know how they got in.
ISABEL They had to have known the code.
She moves on to look in the mark's BEDROOM.
PAUL We considered that, but the mark swears that nobody in the world knew the code except him.
PAUL He programmed the last seven steps of the system himself.
PAUL He set it and never left the house again.
PAUL When he dies, we'll probably have to physically cut all the power lines to the house to get it off line.
Isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system which was locked inside a titanium case in Vanderspeigle's bedroom closet.
She answers the detective almost as an afterthought.
ISABEL There are other ways to get the code.
ISABEL Closed loop.
ISABEL Redundant servers.
ISABEL Titanium encasement.
ISABEL Not bad.
The lead detective enters the bedroom.
PAUL Like what?
Again, Isabel is inside her own mind.
She's really just answering the detective's questions out of courtesy.
ISABEL Uh...well, they probably set up in a house across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of binoculars.
We GO WITH HIM as he walks back into the office.
He stands at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code.
He twists around and looks out the window behind him.
PAUL Actually, I don't know about that.
Isabel re-enters the office.
PAUL (cont'd) Unless he had a habit of typing in the code like this--
He stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type in the numbers.
It's an obviously unnatural position.
Then he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one normally would.
PAUL (cont'd) --then his body would block the view from across the canal.
ISABEL That's why they probably set up over there--
She points out an adjacent window on another wall.
ISABEL (cont'd) --And used the mirror.
She points at a small mirror on the opposite wall.
The detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the keypad, then he looks in the mirror.
He can see directly across the canal into another house.
ISABEL (cont'd) I'm guessing they'd need a fifteen hundred millimeter lens to get a clear shot but--
But Isabel's already moved on.
Something has caught her attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint that is shinier than the paint that surrounds it.
Isabel puts her finger to her tongue to wet it, then touches the shiny area.
When she pulls her finger away there is paint on it.
Isabel cocks her head.
A black-clad thief (LINUS) uses a paint brush to touch up the wall above the alarm keypad.
The lead detective watches Isabel intently.
PAUL What is it?
Isabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from Vanderspeigle's desk to gently dig at the wall under the paint.
The plaster there is soft and wet.
In fact it isn't plaster at all.
It's spackle.
PAUL (cont'd) What is that?
Isabel cooks her head again.
THUNK!
A crossbow bolt hits the wall above the alarm panel.
ISABEL It's where the crossbow bolt hit.
PAUL A crossbow bolt?
ISABEL Ever heard of Franz Schuman?
PAUL No.
Isabel is at the window.
The one that Vanderspeigle leaves cracked open every night.
Isabel looks across the canal at the apartment where Basher and Saul were playing cards.
ISABEL They would have fired from that roof.
ISABEL Through this open window.
Isabel kneels down, checks the line-of-sight to make sure she's correct.
PAUL From that roof, through this window?
PAUL Nobody could make a shot like that.
ISABEL Not a cop, anyway.
PAUL What's that supposed to mean?
ISABEL Sorry.
ISABEL Your friend downstairs put me in a bad mood.
PAUL He's an idiot.
PAUL You shouldn't let him bother you.
ISABEL Yes.
ISABEL You're right.
Isabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name: "Eugene `Basher' Tarr."
There are two names above Basher's in her little book: "Robert Ryan" and "Danny Ocean."
ISABEL (cont'd) But these man are exceptionally good.
ISABEL (cont'd) Even when they make mistakes.
A bolt flies through Vanderspeigle's open window and hits the wall above the alarm pad.
Two thin wires are attached to a tiny wheel, which is attached to the back of the bolt.
The wires run back to the window of the apartment across the canal.
Inside that apartment: the wires end in another tiny wheel which is mounted on a large tripod for stability.
In effect the group now has a mini-clothesline running between the alarm pad and the apartment across the canal.
Livingston attaches a device designed to fit directly over the number pad of Vanderspeigle's keypad to the "clothesline" that runs across the canal.
Isabel writes: "Livingston Dell?" Underneath Basher's name in her notebook.
Livingston's device is shuttled across the canal, through Vanderspeigle's cracked window and right to the alarm panel.
Magnets on the side of the device cause it to snap into place over the top of the keypad.
Livingston then types a six- digit code into a remote keypad.
His keypunches are mimicked by the remote device.
Vanderspeigle's alarm shuts off.
Downstairs: From inside we see the front door lock picked.
The door swings open.
Isabel nods her head.
There's a slight smile on her face.
The smile of admiration, respect in another's skills.
ISABEL When did he get up and notice the certificate was gone?
PAUL The alarm woke him at 4:2O am.
ISABEL But the alarm would have been--
She stops.
And smiles to herself.
ISABEL (cont'd) Oh...
ISABEL (cont'd) Oh, I know what happened.
PAUL What?
Isabel quickly glances around the room.
Her eye lands on the floor near the false bookcase.
On some dark lines in the crevices where the floor boards meet.
She kneels down for a closer look.
ISABEL There was someone else.
PAUL Someone else.
Danny and Rusty come through the front door.
They are followed by Linus.
All of them are soaking wet from 24 hours in the swamp under the house, and the last few minutes in the pouring rain outside the front door.
The group silently slips up the stairs.
ISABEL (V.O.) Oh, I wish I could've have seen that.
They enter Vanderspeigle's office.
You can hear him snoring in the other room.
Danny and Rusty quickly, carefully remove the crossbow bolt from the wall and take it to the window.
They drop it (and the attached wires) to the Malloys, who are waiting on the street below.
Meanwhile Linus spackles the hole in the wall and paints over the spackle.
Danny and Rusty turn to see that Linus is finished.
They hand-signal each other like Special Forces guys do, then move towards the bookcase on the adjacent wall.
ISABEL (V.O.) That must have really been something.
Suddenly:
DANNY Wait!
DANNY Wait!
DANNY Shhhh!
Everyone freezes.
Danny puts his hand up to his ear to try to listen for the sound he thought he heard.
We hear the faint sound of somebody singing to themselves.
Danny and Rusty quickly realize it's coming from behind the bookcase.
What the hell?
They yank open the false bookcase to reveal a handsome Frenchman who has just finished cleaning out the contents of Vanderspeigle's safe.
Danny and Rusty stare at him.
He turns around and sees them, but if he's bothered in the slightest he sure isn't showing it.
Danny approaches him.
This exchange is whispered with a great amount of drama at very close range.
DINNER JACKET Can I help you?
DANNY Yeah.
DANNY What the hell are you doing?
DINNER JACKET I am getting here first.
Just then, Frank and Yen arrive.
The Frenchman looks them over.
RUSTY This is our score.
DINNER JACKET I am here before you.
FRANK We let you in the house!
FRANK Somehow you got in after we hit the code but before we got to the door.
DINNER JACKET That's thirty seconds.
DINNER JACKET How could I know which exact thirty seconds I had?
DINNER JACKET Unless I knew you plan.
DINNER JACKET Could I have known your plan?
DINNER JACKET Do you have a snitch in your group?
DANNY No.
RUSTY We don't.
DINNER JACKET Yes, I know you don't.
DINNER JACKET Because I saw, the whole thing from that chair.
DINNER JACKET I knew you were around, but I had my own plan.
Yen says something in Chinese.
DINNER JACKET There's really no need for that.
Danny wants to raise his voice, but he can't.
Vanderspeigle is snoring twenty feet away.
DANNY Listen, we have to come to some arrangement.
LINUS We've incurred some very serious costs here.
Danny and Rusty look at him.
LINUS Well, we have.
The Malloys arrive.
DINNER JACKET Every second I am becoming more outnumbered.
VIRGIL Who's this?
FRANK He said he got here first.
VIRGIL That's bullshit.
RUSTY Hey.
RUSTY Mouth.
VIRGIL This is our goddamned job!
He sounds as angry as a guy who's whispering can sound.
LIVINGSTON If the situation were reversed--
DINNER JACKET But the situation is not reversed.
DINNER JACKET The situation is that I am here first, without any help from you.
Livingston arrives, soaking wet like everyone else.
DINNER JACKET So as much as I would--
Basher and Saul arrive.
DINNER JACKET Jesus, how many of you are there?
DANNY Just give us the stock certificate.
DANNY Whatever else you took out of that safe...it's yours.
Dinner Jacket stops.
Thinks for a moment.
Then:
DINNER JACKET No.
DINNER JACKET But: I leave you with something.
He hands Danny a business card.
DINNER JACKET My attorney.
DINNER JACKET In case Evelyn's employer tries anything...well, anything.
Dinner Jacket smiles, then pulls a tiny electronic device out of his shirt pocket.
He presses a button.
And the alarm blares to life.
Paul stares at Isabel.
PAUL Are you sure?
ISABEL I'm sure there's another scenario that would fit these physical details, but I don't know what it is.
PAUL Where should we start?
Isabel takes out her PDA, writes something on her keypad, and hits a few buttons.
A second later, Paul's BEEPER goes off.
ISABEL You can start by picking that guy up.
The group sits around looking depressed.
VIRGIL Who the hell was that guy?
FRANK It's going to get out, you know.
FRANK People are going to find out.
BASHER Somebody must know this bloke's name.
LIVINGSTON The question is who trained him.
LIVINGSTON He got into that place alone.
DANNY He says.
FRANK I believed him.
SAUL You think he's better than us?
FRANK I'm not saying anything, but the man was sitting there, waiting for us.
LINUS Do you think the cops even know who this guys is?
RUSTY Please.
RUSTY That guy's never even seen a cop.
TURK Maybe he works with the cops.
SAUL You don't work with the cops unless you absolutely have to.
SAUL And not even then.
BASHER Either way, he's got to have a name.
LIVINGSTON It can't be that hard to find out who this guy is.
LIVINGSTON Like I said, somebody trained him.
LIVINGSTON Who trains the best?
DANNY LeMarc.
DANNY Right?
RUSTY If he's not dead.
LINUS Who's LeMarc?
Stunned silence from the guys.
They won't even respond.
Yen says something.
Isabel arrives.
Isabel is waiting to be processed.
Eventually, she is directed down a hallway.
We LOOK through a one-way mirror into the interrogation room where detectives Onderdonk and Devenpeck are trying the bad cop / bad cop routine on Evelyn.
Isabel walks INTO FRAME and watches: Onderdonk slams his fist on the table.
Davenpeck shouts in Evelyn's face.
Evelyn just laughs.
Isabel shakes her head.
Frustrated and more exhausted than their detainee, the two detectives leave the interrogation room for the ante-room where Isabel is.
ONDERDONK Fucking stone.
DAVENPECK I'm not quitting.
ONDERDONK Who said quitting.
ONDERDONK I'm tired.
ISABEL Can I speak to him?
The two detectives look at each other.
DAVENPECK Who are you?
Isabel produces a signed document.
They look at it, shrug, and give it back.
DAVENPECK Apparently, you can do whatever you want with him.
ONDERDONK Are you moving him?
ISABEL Oh no.
ISABEL I just need to speak with him.
ISABEL To get some information.
DAVENPECK We've been on him for six hours.
ONDERDONK With our best stuff.
DAVENPECK Our best stuff.
DAVENPECK In mind terms, we've been torturing this guy.
ISABEL I'm sure.
ISABEL I only need a moment, then I'll be out of your way.
They shrug.
Isabel goes into the room with Evelyn.
We STAY WITH Onderdonk and Davenpeck, who watch her through the two- way mirror.
THROUGH THE MIRROR: Isabel walks right up to Evelyn, smiles, and whispers one word to him/her.
Evelyn's face freezes.
He/she looks at Isabel, scared.
Then he/she starts to weep.
Uncontrollably....
Tears stream down his/her face.
Isabel hands Evelyn a sheet of paper and he/she begins to write.
Onderdonk and Davenpeck are dumbfounded.
Isabel turns around so she's facing them.
The entire group, minus Danny, sits around glumly watching CNN International on the flat screen.
Danny is on his cell phone on the other side of the room.
DANNY (INTO PHONE) It's not a problem, it's a hiccup.
DANNY (INTO PHONE) It won't affect our schedule that much.
DANNY (INTO PHONE) I want to talk about you, not the job.
DANNY (INTO PHONE) How are you doing?
KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK.
Something about it doesn't sound familiar.
Danny moves into the big roam.
Rusty is at the door, looking through the peep-hole.
Rusty puts his head down.
Clearly it isn't a stranger.
DANNY Tess, I've got to call you back.
He hangs up.
KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK.
Rusty indicates for Danny to get it.
DANNY Coming.
Danny opens the door to reveal ISABEL.
She looks at Danny.
He looks back at her.
They don't say a word.
Danny motions for her to come in.
RUSTY Who is it?
ISABEL Hello, Robert.
Rusty spins to see Isabel.
RUSTY Isabel.
He crosses to her.
STAY with the group for a moment.
LINUS "Robert?" Is that his real name?
Virgil and Turk shrug.
LINUS How does she know that?
LIVINGSTON Ex-girlfriend.
BASHER & SAUL Fiancee.
The entire group is watching them.
RUSTY It's great to see you.
ISABEL Is it?
ISABEL Because you've been seeing a lot of me lately.
She hands a surveillance photo to Rusty.
ISABEL You were sitting in a Mercedes outside my apartment on Wednesday night.
She hands Rusty another photo.
(These are the photos Hess the male secretary showed her at Europol HQ that we couldn't see.)
ISABEL You were hiding in the bushes when I had lunch yesterday at Trattoria Bella.
She hands him a third photo.
Looks at the fourth.
ISABEL This one...I'm not even sure where this one was taken, but I like it a lot.
ISABEL Very Ron Gallela.
She hands this photo to Danny.
It's a picture of Rusty, with a dorky look on his face, peering out from behind a mailbox he's using as cover while he spies on Isabel.
ISABEL I mean, if I didn't know better I'd think you all came here to steal the Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift, also known as the world's first stock certificate.
ISABEL You must have been so proud of yourselves.
ISABEL A Schuman Special.
ISABEL It's been awhile.
ISABEL That was a very handsome crossbow shot, Eugene.
Basher winces at the sound of his real name.
The group stares back at her.
Can't believe this is happening.
ISABEL And the Palowski...whose idea was that?
She knows it was Rusty.
RUSTY We didn't steal anything.
ISABEL Oh...I know you didn't.
ISABEL Somebody beat you to it.
ISABEL One man.
ISABEL No crew.
ISABEL No back up.
ISABEL Tell me something -- just so I can get the full picture in my head -- was he wearing a tuxedo?
ISABEL A white dinner jacket?
BASHER At least we saw him in the flesh.
BASHER You'll never see this guy your whole life.
ISABEL So you know who he is?
DANNY Of course we know who he is.
ISABEL Well, then.
ISABEL I'll see you when you see him.
ISABEL To get your certificate back.
She takes the photo of Rusty peeking from behind the mailbox from Danny's hand.
She walks out.
The group is frozen.
Livingston is still looking at the pictures of Rusty following Isabel.
LIVINGSTON Who's hat is that?
SAUL How did she-- That was--
DANNY This is what I was talking about.
DANNY This is exactly what I was talking--
RUSTY --I was just checking up on her.
RUSTY I knew she didn't want to see me.
RUSTY I was being polite.
TURK Where did she learn all that stuff?
TURK The Palowski stuff.
DANNY Her father.
VIRGIL He was a cop?
RUSTY Thief.
LINUS Was he good?
DANNY Very.
FRANK Great.
VIRGIL What's the big deal?
VIRGIL She's just some brilliant, pissed-off ex- girlfriend who's dad taught her every trick in the book.
SAUL & BASHER Fiancee.
TURK But did you see that display of emotion, handing out those pictures?
VIRGIL Totally unprofessional.
RUSTY She's passionate.
VIRGIL She's unbalanced.
RUSTY Her job is very stressful.
SAUL She could reduce her stress by leaving us alone.
DANNY We've got to slow her down.
Everyone agrees.
DANNY But first: We find our French friend and introduce ourselves.
Isabel is talking to her superior.
ISABEL'S BOSS Twenty-four hours.
ISABEL'S BOSS You know that.
ISABEL I don't have twenty-four hours.
ISABEL They're there now.
ISABEL They'll lead me to him.
ISABEL'S BOSS You also know that you can go now, if you don't take your secretary.
ISABEL'S BOSS When there's liability, I need a document.
She nods.
Isabel exits.
HESS He said we can't leave until tomorrow because of liability issues and he needs a document.
ISABEL Yes.
HESS Thanks for trying.
ISABEL Let's share a car.
HESS That would be nice.
HESS Thank you.
ISABEL I can't believe they won't make an exception.
ISABEL I've got to find out who this other guy is.
Dinner Jacket (AKA FRANCOIS TOULOUR) wins a huge blackjack bet.
The crowd reacts enthusiastically.
A beautiful woman stands near him.
The crowd around the blackjack table erupts as Toulour wine another massive bet.
Note: The same dealer pays him off.
The same crowd is watching.

ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN How far is your house, Baron?
TOULOUR Twenty minutes by helicopter.

LIVINGSTON (V.O.) The French national police just gave him a nickname.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) "Le Renard Nuit" -- The Night Fox.
Danny rolls his eyes.
BASHER Scotland Yard said he's the new LeMarc.
RUSTY Scotland Yard never saw LeMarc.
A helicopter lands on a massive Lake Como estate.
Toulour gets out.
New clothes.
New woman.
DANNY (V.O.) Personal information?

The woman can't believe all the security he has.
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN What do you have in there, the Mona Lisa?
TOULOUR Please.
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN You know what?
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN I don't like that painting either.
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN I don't like anything Van Gogh did.
Toulour smiles and lets her in.
LINUS (V.O.) He's an avid golfer, pro-level tennis player, and inveterate gambler.
LINUS (V.O.) But apparently his favorite pastime is....
LINUS (V.O.) Linus trails off.
DANNY What?
RUSTY Spit it out, Linus.
A tableau shot looking into the bedroom.
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN joins Toulour in his bedroom.
LINUS He's rarely alone.
LINUS I think it's a compulsion.
LINUS I have a list of names here...it was just the first week.
DANNY All right, moving on, is there anything else we need to know about this guy before we--
BASHER Did we forget to mention he's a Viscount?
DANNY A what?
LIVINGSTON Viscount.
LIVINGSTON As in nobility.
DANNY Last time I checked titles like that went out with a little number I like to call the French Revolution--
BASHER Spain.
DANNY What?
BASHER His title.
BASHER It's Spanish.
BASHER Mother's cousin.
Toulour crawls out of bad.
Wonders who the woman next to him is.
DANNY He may be the greatest thief in Europe.
DANNY He may have slept with half of the EU.
DANNY He may be a Casanova with the soul of a starving artist.
DANNY It doesn't matter.
Toulour comes downstairs in his bathrobe.
DANNY There's something he cares about.
DANNY There's something he can't live without.
Toulour reaches the base of the stairs and stops dead in his tracks.
He looks ahead of him to a wall covered with paintings.
One painting is clearly missing.
All that remains are the dust/fade marks on the wall to indicate that it had been there.
He walks up to the wall and smiles -- certainly this will be an interesting day.
He's actually been cheered up by this.
Toulour in playing a hard-fought game of tennis.
His opponent (EDMUND) bangs a great shot.
Toulour gets there and smacks it back.
Edmund dives for the ball, just gets it back over the net.
But Toulour is waiting and hits a kill shot.
EDMUNDS Are you on steroids?
EDMUNDS Toulour laughs.
EDMUND Let's try again.
EDMUND Give me five games this time.
TOULOUR You are worse than Sampras.
TOULOUR You should be paying me.
TOULOUR A BUTLER arrives.
BUTLER Pardon me, sir.
BUTLER He hands Toulour two business cards.
BUTLER One says "Daniel Ocean," the other "Rusty Ryan."
BUTLER Two gentlemen.
BUTLER They say they met you in Amsterdam last week.
TOULOUR Put them on the veranda and get them a drink.
TOULOUR I'll be right up.
Danny and Rusty look out over Lake Como.
Toulour arrives.
TOULOUR Rusty.
TOULOUR (cont'd) Danny.
DANNY Other way around.
TOULOUR Are you sure?
TOULOUR Usually I'm so good at that.
TOULOUR Edmund arrives, carrying his tennis bag.
TOULOUR This is Edmund.
TOULOUR Edmund.
TOULOUR Rusty.
TOULOUR Danny.
TOULOUR He calls by their wrong names again.
DANNY Nice to meet you.
DANNY Edmund.
DANNY You a tennis pro?
DANNY Rusty takes a sip of ice tea.
EDMUND Actually, no, I'm the King of Morocco.
EDMUND Danny and Rusty nod, their smiles frozen.
Toulour shows Danny and Rusty his art.
TOULOUR Sadly, I can't show you my favorite painting of all -- a Degas that used to hang right there -- because it was stolen recently.
DANNY That's awful.
RUSTY The criminal element is everywhere these days.
RUSTY Toulour nods.
DANNY Listen, Francois--
TOULOUR Please.
TOULOUR Call me Baron.
DANNY We came here for the Vanderspeigle certificate--
TOULOUR That's not for sale.
DANNY Your Degas is worth three times that.
DANNY You want your painting back, you're going to have to trade.
TOULOUR You actually expect me to believe that you are in possession of my Degas?
TOULOUR You are living in a...in a bubble.
TOULOUR Toulour looks at them and walks away.
Rusty and Danny stand with the rest of the group.
BASHER He used the word "amateur"?
BASHER Rusty and Danny nod reluctantly.
VIRGIL You said we could show him the painting right, to prove that we had it.
DANNY Yes.
RUSTY He still wouldn't trade.
RUSTY Yen says something.
FRANK We need to teach him a lesson.
TURK Absolutely.
DANNY All right, let's stay calm.
DANNY We don't need to over-react here.
DANNY He said some disrespectful things, that's true.
DANNY But why antagonize this guy?
DANNY Why get into something with him?
DANNY He's young and he's filthy rich, and he's got time on his hands.
DANNY We don't want to become his Betty noir.
DANNY We can just fence his painting and earn a lot more than we would have from the certificate.
BASHER It's about reputation.
BASHER You said so yourself.
BASHER We have to get that certificate to Evelyn's buyer or--
DANNY We'll make enough selling the Degas to pay off her buyer--
FRANK Then why did you make that trip down there in the first place, if you didn't want to get into something?
DANNY Saul?
SAUL Turn his name over to Isabel.
SAUL In exchange for getting off our backs.
SAUL Tough one to swallow.
SAUL Short of that...the only appropriate response is to steal his next job right out from under him.
SAUL Just like he did to us.
TURK We don't even know our next job.
DANNY We got ten million in that closet.
Danny points at the closet in the room.
DANNY I cash in the Degas, take a moment to think about our next move.
DANNY Toulour isn't going anywhere.
DANNY You guys are hyping him too much, you're letting him get inside your head.
DANNY Everyone agrees.
DANNY Danny opens the closet.
DANNY There's a picture frame in there, but NO PICTURE.
DANNY It's been stolen by Toulour.
DANNY We hear the SOUND OF A CASE BEING SHUT AND LOCKED.
We see a SMALL, SECURE BOX being transported to a heavily secured truck.
The truck exits the building and drives down a street with security MOTORCYCLES surrounding it.
The motorcade heads for the private airport.
The secure box is loaded onto a plane as Isabel and her male secretary Hess exit a plane nearby.
Isabel and Hess heading into Paris.
ISABEL Why do I need to see all these guys?
ISABEL When I tracked the Munch down in Sweden I got all the approvals I needed with one phone call.
ISABEL (cont'd) With Lenin's shaving kit the Russians brought me in and it took a single signature and I got it at the airport a minute after I arrived.
ISABEL (cont'd) What's so goddamned special about the French?
ISABEL (cont'd) Hess gives her a look as though she should know better.
HESS Without their signatures, you can't do anything.
HESS You can't pull the suspects over, you can't do surveillance on them, you're not even allowed to contact them.
HESS They're real sticklers about sovereignty issues here.
The Bureaucrat looks at Isabel.
All of her.
INSPECTOR Isabel, I couldn't possibly sign those documents in good conscience without talking to you about the case in detail.
INSPECTOR I realize you're in a hurry and my schedule for the rest of the day is quite full, so perhaps, if you're interested in being expedient, we could discuss the case...over dinner.
Isabel sits in the back with Hess.
HESS Foucquet's at eight-thirty.
HESS Apparently their's a private room.
HESS Better bring your kevlar.
HESS Don't stop for that.
The driver accelerates through a yellow/red light, almost hitting DANNY AND TOULOUR
Who deftly avoid getting crushed.
DANNY That's not how I want to go.
TOULOUR No.
TOULOUR They walk on.
TOULOUR Very theatrical of you...asking to meet here.
TOULOUR Like we're spies meeting to do an exchange.
DANNY Why are you doing this to us?
TOULOUR Doing what?
DANNY This is a game for you.
DANNY For us it's survival.
DANNY Are you that bored?
DANNY I mean...
TOULOUR No.
TOULOUR I wouldn't do that.
TOULOUR No...
TOULOUR The truth is...I made a bet.
TOULOUR Or maybe a better word is a "wager".
DANNY What kind of wager?
Danny and Toulour sit across from each other.
The bottom quarter of the Eifel tower is visible in the background.
TOULOUR A gentlemen's wager with a friend of mine -- my mentor.
TOULOUR A few months ago we were at his winter place in Nicaragua and another guest referred to me as "the greatest thief in the world."
TOULOUR I didn't object, obviously, but my mentor fell silent.
TOULOUR Later I asked him about it.
TOULOUR He said if I really wanted to say I was the best thief...I'd have to prove I was better than the eleven of you.
TOULOUR (cont'd) You know, the Benedict job made waves, even all the way over here.
TOULOUR (cont'd) 16.3 million dollars.
TOULOUR (cont'd) That's a lot of money.
TOULOUR Sorry.
TOULOUR 163.
TOULOUR Before you were found.
TOULOUR Yes, 163 million is a lot of money.
TOULOUR It attracts attention.
TOULOUR So, in a way, you brought this problem with me on yourselves.
TOULOUR You're victims of your own success.
DANNY Here's what I'm going to do.
DANNY You tell me the name of your mentor.
DANNY I'll call him up and I'll tell him that you're the greatest thief in the world...that I accept that to be true....
DANNY And in return...you leave us alone, let us go about our business.
DANNY How about that?
TOULOUR He said you'd probably say something like that -- but he said you'd probably have your fingers crossed when you said it.
TOULOUR Danny frowns, pulls his hand out of his pocket.
TOULOUR (CONT'D) So in this situation -- for the purposes of my wager -- words aren't good enough.
TOULOUR (CONT'D) I have to prove this on the ground.
DANNY This mentor of yours...was he a good thief in his day?
TOULOUR Who, LeMarc?
Danny swallows.
DANNY Yeah.
DANNY Him.
Angle on the group -- they're slack-jawed.
LIVINGSTON Who?
LIVINGSTON Yen says something.
RUSTY I thought so too.
SAUL LeMarc.
SAUL The LeMarc.
SAUL Danny nods.
SAUL God hates me.
SAUL He hates all of us.
FRANK Hell, this could go on forever.
DANNY No.
DANNY It's going to be settled by one more job.
DANNY A single object.
SAUL Whatever it is, let's just let him have it.
DANNY We can't.
LIVINGSTON Because of pride?
DANNY Because we beat him, he'll pay Benedict off.
DANNY A stunned beat.
FRANK Now we're talking.
BASHER One score, for the whole thing?
LIVINGSTON What do we have to do?
LIVINGSTON I mean, is it a fair bet or is it like...the Coronation Egg or something?
LIVINGSTON Danny points.
LIVINGSTON That's it.
LIVINGSTON That's the one.
SAUL He wants us to steal the Coronation Egg!
BASHER That's just...
BASHER that's...what is that?
SAUL The Holy Grail.
RUSTY Carl Faberge, the greatest goldsmith in history, constructed the Coronation Egg in 1896 for the wedding of Czar Nicholas and Alexandra.
RUSTY Every world class thief in the last 108 years has tried to steal it.
RUSTY No one has even come close.
SAUL That's because it's cursed.
LINUS What?
SAUL It's un-stealable.
DANNY It's the only thing in LeMarc's entire career that he went after but failed to get.
DANNY He tried three times.
DANNY A long beat of silence....
DANNY We get the egg and we're free.
BASHER That's great, except we can't get it.
SAUL It's not possible.
DANNY Then we go to jail.
DANNY A beat...
VIRGIL Well...where is it now?
The SMALL, SECURE BOX is being taken off a plane.
Another motorcade forms and escorts the vehicle into the city.
The motorcade is completely stopped in traffic.
In a nearby sedan, Isabel sits next to an Italian CARABINIERI LIAISON of same sort.
Hess is in the front seat.
ISABEL I'm going to need surveillance on both hotels, phone taps, room bugs, people in the lobby and by every exit.
CARABINIERI OFFICER Yes, absolutely.
ISABEL If I had to guess I'd say I'll need at least 25 people, a dozen vehicles...and an on-call air unit.
CARABINIERI OFFICER Yes, absolutely.
ISABEL Okay, one more thing, and this is crucial: these guys are extremely, sophisticated at avoiding electronic surveillance, so we'll need real state of the art stuff.
ISABEL (cont'd) I'm talking synthetic aperture pinhole cameras, wave reformation mics with a high Plank coefficient and a passive input structure-- You're not writing anything down; are you sure you're getting all this?
CARABINIERI OFFICER Yes, absolutely.
ISABEL Okay.
ISABEL Good.
ISABEL Now what time am I meeting Captain Giordano?
ISABEL A beat...
CARABINIERI OFFICER Yes...
ISABEL No, what time?
ISABEL Another beat...
CARABINIERI OFFICER Yes...absolutely...
CARABINIERI OFFICER Isabel looks right at him.
ISABEL I see...so...you've spoken with the Pope and he's okay with autographing my breasts?
ISABEL Hess turns around.
CARABINIERI OFFICER Yes, absolutely.
CARABINIERI OFFICER Isabel sighs loudly and sinks back into her seat.
The motorcade arrives at the Museum of Modern Art.
We follow armored car and continue on to find Danny walking up the front steps.
Angle on Livingston as he subtly nods at something in the distance.
Danny is standing next to him.
DANNY What am I looking at?
LIVINGSTON A TR354 infra red motion detection system.
LIVINGSTON It's the gold standard.
DANNY Saul and Linus back yet?
LIVINGSTON No.
DANNY No?
LIVINGSTON And I can't find Rusty.
Frank and Yen look at an "authorized-entry only" door as a member of the museum staff goes through it.
The door has a complex double-locking mechanism that would make it impossible to pick.
Yen says something in Chinese.
FRANK What?
FRANK Yen says something in Chinese, again.
FRANK Well, I don't know, but that's one nasty lock.
FRANK Danny approaches.
DANNY Seen Rusty?
FRANK We thought he was with you.
Danny moves off.
Basher is being questioned by Danny.
BASHER Not since we first got here.
BASHER About an hour ago.
BASHER Danny moves away.
BASHER (cont'd) And where's Saul and Linus?
Isabel enters her room.
Suddenly she spins and draws her pistol.
Her gun ends up in Rusty's face.
ISABEL Jesus, Robert.
ISABEL I could've killed you.
ISABEL He shrugs.
ISABEL A long beat as she takes a look at him.
RUSTY I'm older.
ISABEL I hope so.
ISABEL What are you doing in my room?
RUSTY I thought maybe we could get some coffee.
ISABEL No, thanks.
RUSTY Okay, how about a two week trip to Zanzibar?
ISABEL Please don't.
RUSTY Fine, coffee then.
RUSTY Whatever you say.
RUSTY Isabel gives an exasperated sigh.
ISABEL Why do I want to have coffee with you?
RUSTY How should I know?
RUSTY sorry about your mom.
RUSTY Isable nods.
RUSTY (cont'd) She was a real...
ISABEL She hated you.
RUSTY Well, she was nice enough to hide it from me.
RUSTY Some people can't even do that.
ISABEL She hated everybody.
ISABEL Rusty nods.
ISABEL He remembers.
ISABEL You'll never get it by the way.
RUSTY Get what?
ISABEL You'll think you've got it, you'll be so close that you'll be able to taste it and then this guy, the Night Fox or whoever he is, will just take it -- right out of your hand -- just like he did in Amsterdam.
ISABEL He's as good as LeMarc.
RUSTY It's not possible.
ISABEL You're in a bubble.
Rusty looks at her.
A mock up of the room the egg will be displayed in.
A dummy egg sits on a cradle in the center of the room.
Infra-red motion detectors cover the room.
Motion sensitive lasers shine directly onto the egg.
Danny, Basher, Yen, Frank, and Livingston try to figure out how to get around the security systems.
LIVINGSTON (IN THE BACKGROUND) No, that won't work either.
LIVINGSTON (IN THE BACKGROUND) The IR will pick it up before you even get close.
LIVINGSTON (IN THE BACKGROUND) This is depressing to everyone.
FRANK Look, if we're having this much trouble, and we've got ten guys Toulour must be pulling his hair out.
Toulour lies in a lounge chair.
The group agrees Toulour must be suffering like them.
Rusty strides in.
Everyone looks at him.
He looks at the mock up of the egg.
RUSTY Would you call that bubble-shaped?
DANNY What?
DANNY Rusty shrugs it off.
RUSTY She pulled a gun on me.
RUSTY He sits.
RUSTY (cont'd) She won't back off.
FRANK Are you back on?
RUSTY I'm selling.
RUSTY She ain't buying.
DANNY More importantly, what kind of reception is the Italian Police giving her?
A SUBORDINATE OFFICER leads Isabel down a hallway.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER Captain Giordano is handling an urgent interrogation.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER He'll be up as soon as it is completed.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER Please wait in here.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER He leads Isabel and Hess into the Captain's office.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER A large clock on the wall reads 11:45 am.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER The open windows in the office look out onto one of Rome's famous courtyards.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER Captain Giordano stands with three other officers.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER They are having a loud, tense conversation in Italian.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER Isabel watches as Giordano's temper really flares.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER He jabs his finger at one of the other cops.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO (SUBTITLED) Naples sucks!
CAPTAIN GIORDANO (SUBTITLED) They're a joke!
CAPTAIN GIORDANO (SUBTITLED) The only decent player they have is Pasqualli -- and he's a pussy.
ITALIAN COP 1 (SUBTITLED) Pasqualli runs circles around Bologna's backfield every time.
ITALIAN COP 2 (SUBTITLED) Pasqualli could single-handedly-- Isabel turns to the officer who escorted her in.
ISABEL What are they talking about?
SUBORDINATE OFFICER It's an internal matter, Madame.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER Isabel and Hess look at each other.
The Captain continues to argue.
Those involved in the discussion are being brought lunch.
Isabel's sitting on the couch now, her eye lids drooping.
Hess checks his PDA.
ITALIAN COP 3 (O.S., SUBTITLED) --and her friends could trounce NapIes!
ITALIAN COP 3 (O.S., SUBTITLED) The clock on the wall reads 2:20 PM.
ITALIAN COP 3 (O.S., SUBTITLED) Isabel's been here two and a half hours.
Livingston, Yen, Danny, and Rusty are experimenting with a way for Yen to drop from the ceiling so that he's hanging right over the egg.
Their mock-up alarm rings.
A red light flashes.
LIVINGSTON Damn-it.
LIVINGSTON Danny rubs his face.
LIVINGSTON This is feeling impossible.
LIVINGSTON He goes into the corner and clicks a walkie-talkie.
LIVINGSTON in the background we see Rusty trying to keep everybody's spirits high.
RUSTY All right, okay.
RUSTY Let's not be defeatists....
RUSTY What about that mirror trick that Akimbo tried at the--
LIVINGSTON --There's no mirror thin enough to avoid tripping the lasers.
In the foreground, Danny on the walkie-talkie.
DANNY What's he doing now?
VIRGIL (RADIO V.O.) Nothing.
VIRGIL (RADIO V.O.) Just reading the papers at a cafe.
VIRGIL (RADIO V.O.) Oh, no, wait.
VIRGIL (RADIO V.O.) A woman just sat down next to him....
VIRGIL (RADIO V.O.) He's getting her phone number.
TURK (RADIO V.O.) Wow.
TURK (RADIO V.O.) What are those?
VIRGIL (RADIO V.O.) Jimmy Chu.
TURK (RADIO V.O.) I've never seen that color.
DANNY Okay, take it easy over there.
DANNY Saul and Linus enter.
DANNY What happened?
DANNY Linus puts his BACKPACK down.
LINUS We thought someone was following us.
SAUL We gave 'em the shake.
SAUL Caught 'em napping.
Isabel is asleep on the couch.
It's 5:30 PM.
A hand taps her shoulder.
She wakes up and is shocked to see Captain Giordano, finally, standing above her.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER Captain Giordano, Rome Police Special Investigations.
SUBORDINATE OFFICER Isabel Lahiri, Europol, Major Theft Task Force.
The Captain nods.
Isabel looks over at Hess, who is still asleep.
Isabel and the Captain are alone now.
Giordano is looking right into her eyes, with laser focus.
There isn't even a hint of lasciviousness about him.
He's all business.
ISABEL ...reason to believe these men...
ISABEL ...are going to try to steal the Coronation Egg when it is actually put on display next week.
ISABEL I need official authorization to surveil and pursue these suspected criminals on Italian soil.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Yes, absolutely.
ISABEL And I'll need substantial resources from your department.
ISABEL Can I count on that?
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Yes, absolutely.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Isabel stops.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Starts to wonder.
ISABEL So, Captain, what do you think of my skirt?
ISABEL He smiles and looks at her.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO I think it's very beautiful.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Why, don't you like it?
Danny and Toulour.
A waiter brings them coffee, Danny SPOONS in a lot of sugar, then stirs.
TOULOUR I don't usually call for a second date.
TOULOUR For you I make an exception.
DANNY Thanks.
TOULOUR I think it's good that we talk.
TOULOUR You see, you should stop following me.
TOULOUR You're wasting your time.
TOULOUR I'm going to let you go first and get caught.
TOULOUR Then they will increase the security even more, and then I will steal the Egg.
TOULOUR Then Lemarc can make his decision.
DANNY You sound confident.
TOULOUR Confident?
TOULOUR This is a very American word.
TOULOUR I am arrogant.
TOULOUR There's a difference.
DANNY Doesn't matter if you're that good.
DANNY Are you that good?
TOULOUR I can move objects with my mind.
TOULOUR Danny just looks at him.
TOULOUR You don't believe it?
DANNY Do you?
TOULOUR Are you done stirring your sugar?
TOULOUR Danny stops, lifts the spoon.
TOULOUR It's completely BENT.
DANNY That's fantastic.
DANNY Listen, I appreciate the call, and, best of luck.
TOULOUR Danny.
TOULOUR I'm serious.
TOULOUR Sit down, please.
TOULOUR Danny site down and looks at him.
DANNY You're telekinetic, is that what you're telling me?
TOULOUR Yes.
TOULOUR But...it's a curse.
TOULOUR A nightmare.
TOULOUR Everything is too easy.
TOULOUR But then LeMarc says I'm still not the best.
TOULOUR So I take his challenge.
TOULOUR And you will fail, and I will win, and so what?
TOULOUR What does it prove?
TOULOUR What is he trying to show me?
TOULOUR Danny just looks at him.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Ms. Lahiri, you're in Italy now.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO We are a sovereign nation.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO We're not some adjunct, some administrative district of the EU.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO When Europol calls we don't jump up and tap dance for you.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO If you want to work in Italy, then you have to do it under Italian authority...and that means you have to talk to Commander Andriotti...who, I'm sure, will be happy to meet with you some time next week--
ISABEL Next week!
CAPTAIN GIORDANO --when he returns from vacation.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Isabel slumps back into her chair.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Stares up to the heavens.
Isabel and Hess walk.
HESS He said he has to get approval from someone else and they're on sick leave.
ISABEL Vacation.
HESS Sorry I fell asleep.
ISABEL We both did.
ISABEL I'm exhausted.
An exasperated Isabel tries to regain her equilibrium with a cappuccino.
A piece of music comes over the cafe loudspeaker that catches Isabel's attention.
A CHEESY WAVY SCREEN
Years ago.
Isabel's sitting at the very same cafe reading the newspaper when she hears frantic police whistles.
She looks up to see a man running down the street at full bore.
As he gets closer we realize it's Rusty.
Eight cops are chasing him.
Rusty rushes past the cafe.
As he does he notices Isabel, they make eye contact.
Then he's gone.
Sprints around the corner.
The cops rush past her.
She hears sirens converging from all directions.
Isabel shows her Europol identification to a detective.
ISABEL Hi, this isn't official business.
ISABEL Actually, I'm here on vacation.
ISABEL But I was sitting in a cafe this afternoon, near the Piazza Navona and...the police were chasing someone on foot.
ISABEL I was just wondering if you caught him or...do you know anything about that case?
ITALIAN DETECTIVE I know the case, yes.
ITALIAN DETECTIVE Unfortunately, we didn't catch him.
ISABEL Oh...
Isabel sits in the same seat the next day, reading the newspaper, enjoying her vacation.
She looks up and stops cold.
Rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly-tailored suit, sits down three tables away from her.
She stares at him.
Can't believe it.
The brazenness.
The audacity of this guy.
Rusty doesn't seem to have a care in the world as he chats easily with the waiter, in Italian.
Finally, Isabel just can't help herself.
She gets up and walks over to Rusty's table.
ISABEL Excuse me...
RUSTY Yes.
ISABEL Um...Did I...?
ISABEL I think I saw you...yesterday.
RUSTY Oh yeah?
ISABEL The police were chasing you.
RUSTY You sure your eyes aren't broken?
ISABEL I'm quite sure it was you.
RUSTY Well, then I'm not gonna argue.
RUSTY Can I buy you a coffee?
We transition back to the cafe.
Isabel's phone rings.
ISABEL Hello.
RUSTY We've got to stop meeting like this.
RUSTY She turns.
RUSTY He's sitting at the table behind her.
Isabel and Rusty are being quiet for the moment.
The waiter's in the midst of an animated discussion in Italian with one of the customers.
ISABEL What are they talking about all the time?!
RUSTY Soccer.
RUSTY He doesn't like Naples....thinks they're a bunch of...sissies.
RUSTY Can I ask you a question?
RUSTY Will you come to Zanzibar with me on Friday?
ISABEL Stop it.
Danny sleeps, sitting up, in a chair as the rest of the group tries to figure out how to defeat the security systems around their mock-up egg.
The group breaks into applause startling Danny awake.
LIVINGSTON We did it!
LIVINGSTON It works!
DANNY What, what happened?
TIGHT MEDIUM shot on uniformed National Police officer as he strides down the hallway.
His bearing is disciplined, stern, formal.
He is clearly handling a matter of utmost importance.
Tilt down to reveal he is carrying a tiny cup of
The National Police Officer blows through, passing Hess.
Isabel sits with Commander Andriotti.
The office door swings open and the National Police officer walks in.
He places the cappuccino on Andriotti's desk and leaves.
Giordano sits with his feet up on his desk, smoking a cigar.
The door swings open and Isabel strides in, catching him completely off guard.
She thrusts a piece of paper in his face.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO What's that?
ISABEL An order signed by Commander Andriotti instructing you to "provide any and all support that Agent Lahiri requests, whenever she requests it."
ISABEL He looks at it.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO It's good, yes.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Okay.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO He looks at her.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO That's a very nice blouse you wear today.
Linus and the Malloys walk through the museum.
LINUS When Dominique goes back with Thomas to check the trunk, the money shouldn't be in the briefcase.
LINUS Franklin should have double-crossed them.
VIRGIL That could be a great moment, when he's on the ground.
TURK And you think Thomas is going to get blown up.
VIRGIL Hey.
VIRGIL They look.
VIRGIL A large group of Security people are talking to some NEW TECHNICIANS and ISABEL.
ISABEL Another camera here and here.
ISABEL And have a guard here at all times so any attempt to disable the system will be detected.
ISABEL All your IR devices need to be fitted with reflective faces otherwise a UV later can be used to burn the sensors out.
The guys look glum.
LINUS She just walked in there like Patton or something.
LINUS She's changing...everything and-- There were so many cops with her.
LINUS I've never seen so--
LINUS Danny plats up his hand to stop him.
LINUS I don't understand.
LINUS If her father was a thief...why's she such a hardass?
LINUS I mean you'd think she'd have a little sympathy for us.
RUSTY When she was twelve her mother told her that her dad got arrested doing a job in Russia and died in jail.
RUSTY So I wouldn't count on much sympathy.
BASHER "This time it's personal".
BASHER Danny looks to Rusty, who nods.
Fourteen police cars parked in front of it.
Isabel stands at a police checkpoint on the road in front of the museum chatting with Captain Giordano, who's clearly brown-nosing her big-time since receiving Andriotti's order.
Her phone rings.
She looks at the number and answers it.
ISABEL What do you want?
RUSTY (V.O.) Ever heard of overkill?
ISABEL I don't even think Toulour can get it now.
RUSTY If he gets it, we'll let you arrest us.
RUSTY If we get it, you come away with me to Zanzibar--
ISABEL What is your obsession with Zanzibar?!
RUSTY Do you want to make the bet or not?
ISABEL I'm hanging up.
ISABEL Stop calling me.
Isabel crosses to the elevators.
She enters.
Shuts the door behind her.
Then, instantly, starts balling.
Danny and Rusty stand with Livingston.
LIVINGSTON I'm telling you, with everything she's done in the last twenty-four hours...unless you happen to be best friends with the head of security at the museum, unless you are someone he knows and trusts enough to leave alone in the gallery, after disabling about half of their security system, forget it.
LIVINGSTON We are not stealing that egg...
DANNY "Someone he knows.
DANNY Someone he trusts...."
DANNY "Someone he knows...."
RUSTY What about someone he doesn't know but trusts?
DANNY For instance?
RUSTY I'm talking about you know who, who looks an awful lot like you know who...
RUSTY Everyone looks at Danny.
DANNY She might.
DANNY It's not going to be easy getting her over here.
Tess walks down the street.
She passes an alley, where a utilities truck is raising a MAN IN A BUCKET.
She enters the department store.
Tess shops for perfume.
The Power twins watch her from a discreet distance.
She smiles at them.
Then makes her way to the ladies room.
She walks in and goes right for the window.
She's about to open it when it opens from outside.
She jumps a mile until she sees that BRUISER is there, standing in the bucket from the utilities company.
BRUISER Hiya, Tess.
BRUISER Just climb on through.
BRUISER Try not to look down too much.
Four stories above an alleyway.
Tess climbs out the ladies room window into the cherry picker basket, with Bruiser's help.
Tess climbs into a taxi cab.
Reuben -- in an anachronistic taxi driver's uniform -- is driving.
REUBEN There's make-up in the bag there.
REUBEN And some photos.
REUBEN Do the best you can.
The HOTEL MANAGER comes to the front desk to answer a call.
HOTEL MANAGER Bonjourno.
HOTEL MANAGER Yes.
HOTEL MANAGER Yes.
HOTEL MANAGER Oh...oh, really.
HOTEL MANAGER Well, absolutely.
HOTEL MANAGER We can have...I can make our presidential suite available.
HOTEL MANAGER No, no, no.
HOTEL MANAGER No trouble at all.
HOTEL MANAGER We'd love...
HOTEL MANAGER We're honored that she'd think of us...
HOTEL MANAGER He hangs up.
HOTEL MANAGER Turns, elated, to his front desk staff.
HOTEL MANAGER (SUBTITLED) Julia Roberts is coming to stay with us!
Tess, as Julia Roberts, steps out of a Mercedes limo wearing sunglasses and carrying a puppy.
Frank and Basher, as Nation of Islam bodyguards, clear a place in front of her.
Reuben trails, dressed in the latest hip-hop clothes.
A throng of fans and paparazzi rush toward her.
Strobes blind us.
Fans scream out her name, thrust paper and pen at her for autographs.
It's a frigging madhouse.
PRESS Ms. Roberts!
PRESS Ms. Roberts!
PRESS Why did you come back to Rome so soon!!
TESS I...uh...
PRESS Was it to see Topher?
TESS To see what?
PRESS Topher Grace!!
PRESS Your co-star!!
PRESS Is that why you're here?!
TESS Oh.
TESS No.
TESS I came to -- to see the--
PRESS Where's Danny?
TESS What?
PRESS Danny, your husband!!
TESS Well, he's not really--
REUBEN Ms. Roberts is very tired!!
REUBEN Please let her through!
REUBEN Please!
Tess enters and shuts the door behind her.
She takes a deep breath and exhales.
She looks up at Danny, who's there waiting for her.
TESS I can't do this.
TESS Danny goes to her.
TESS Kisses her.
TESS Hugs her.
TESS When he steps
back he answers:
DANNY Yes, you can.
TESS I'm not an actress, Danny!
TESS And I don't look like her!
DANNY You do, Tess.
DANNY You really do.
DANNY I never told you that before, but it's true.
TESS Come on: my...
TESS She notions at her body, but we can't tell what part.
TESS And my...
TESS She motions at her body again; again it's totally ambiguous what part.
TESS And my ears.
TESS Anybody who sees my ears is going to know instantly.
DANNY Nobody's looking at your ears.
TESS Yes, Danny, they are.
TESS They're going to know.
Isabel stands with the MUSEUM DIRECTOR.
ISABEL When did that happen?
MUSEUM DIRECTOR We just found out.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR I arranged a private showing for tomorrow morning before we open the show to the public.
ISABEL I don't understand, why do you have to disable any of the systems--
MUSEUM DIRECTOR Because she might want to get close to the egg, got right up here and look at it.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR And I'm not going to embarrass myself or this institution by telling her she can't.
ISABEL She's an actress, Giovanni, not the Pope.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR Do you realize how much free publicity we'll get for this museum, just because she because she decided to come by and look at the egg?
MUSEUM DIRECTOR She's even agreed to do a photo shoot for us promoting the museum.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR Isabel gives an exasperated sigh.
ISABEL That's exactly the sort of thing...
Saul, Frank, and Rusty sit on plush couches and watch Isabel's conversation with the museum director from six different angles.
Clearly, Livingston has tapped into the museum's closed circuit system.
ISABEL (TELEVISION V.O.) ...that the people I'm after will exploit.
ISABEL (TELEVISION V.O.) Okay, fine.
ISABEL (TELEVISION V.O.) You want to shut down half the electronic system, let me post eight cops in the room...
ISABEL (TELEVISION V.O.) Saul, Frank, and Rusty clench teeth and fists...
ISABEL (TELEVISION V.O.) On pins and needles for a moment.
ISABEL (TELEVISION V.O.) If the museum director agrees they're in big trouble.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.) Are you crazy?
MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.) That's worse than....you want me to treat her like a criminal?
MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.) The guys relax back into the couches, their plan narrowly having escaped disaster.
On Saul, Frank, and Rusty relaxing.
Only this angle has a digital quality to it -- because we are watching them now through a hi-def TV screen.
PULL BACK to REVEAL Toulour, sitting in a warehouse of his own, watching his own surveillance footage of both our guys' warehouse and the museum's closed circuit system.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.) Look, if you need to do something to reinforce security during her visit, fine.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.) But it's got to be out of sight.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.) And it can't effect Julia in any way.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.) Are we clear?
Toulour eats with a beautiful woman.
Virgil sits six tables away, keeping an eye on him.
Turk strolls in and sits with his brother.
TURK Where is he?
VIRGIL There.
VIRGIL I took a look at the interrogation scene.
TURK Why?
VIRGIL 'Cause Linus said it was repetitive.
TURK It clarifies everything.
VIRGIL He said it's too on the nose.
TURK What's he, the head of the studio?
TURK What's he ever written?
VIRGIL He's just saying -- Oh, no--
TURK What?
VIRGIL It's not him!
VIRGIL Turk spine to see "Toulour" get up at the other table.
VIRGIL Only it's not Toulour.
VIRGIL It's somebody who looks like Toulour from behind.
TURK What!
TURK How did you-- You moron!
TURK You said you were watching him the whole time!
VIRGIL I was!
VIRGIL I mean, I used the bathroom once, but it was quick.
VIRGIL You lost him yesterday!
VIRGIL They sit for a minute.
TURK Livingston said Frank said that Rusty said that Danny said Toulour said don't ever bother following him.
ON Rusty -- the blue light of an unseen television reflecting off his face.
He walks onto the balcony.
We follow Rusty down a hallway.
He enters a dark apartment.
Slips silently through the dining room.
Two places are set.
A candle on the table is burned down to almost nothing.
The lights are out here too.
But Isabel's still awake.
Rusty enters the room.
She doesn't look at him
RUSTY I'm sorry.
ISABEL What happened?
RUSTY I have to go.
RUSTY Right now.
RUSTY I have to leave the country.
RUSTY It could be a while.
RUSTY A month.
RUSTY Maybe more.
RUSTY Isabel turns to look at Rusty.
RUSTY She can barely see the outline of his face in the darkness.
ISABEL What are you saying?
ISABEL What the hell are you saying?
ISABEL Where are you going?
RUSTY I can't tell you.
RUSTY Isabel stares at his dark face.
ISABEL When people start talking the way you're talking there are only two possibilities: you're either in intelligence or you're a criminal.
ISABEL And no one I work with has ever worked with you...or even knows your name.
RUSTY You knew what I was the day you met me, Isabel.
ISABEL Robert...
RUSTY We can talk about it when I get back.
ISABEL No, Robert.
ISABEL I have to tell you something.
RUSTY What is it?
ISABEL I'm taking the job.
ISABEL I'm moving to Amsterdam.
ISABEL He doesn't respond for a moment.
RUSTY I can't have this conversation right now.
RUSTY Please, Isabel.
RUSTY I have to get out of here.
RUSTY I love you.
RUSTY He kisses her then leaves.
Outside the front of the apartment, he shuts the door and turns toward us.
We see his face in the light for the first time: His left eye is swollen shut.
Blood is caked into his hair and on his cheek.
Somebody beat the shit out of him.
Rusty is still on the balcony.
There's a knock at the door.
He opens it to see Isabel.
ISABEL You want to walk?
Rusty and Isabel sit on the steps of the Campidoglio.
ISABEL I know how you're planning to do it.
ISABEL I know Julia's visit is the key.
RUSTY Who's Julia?
ISABEL LeMarc knew when to get out.
ISABEL He just quit...with his perfect record intact.
ISABEL Now he's a legend.
ISABEL Don't do this.
RUSTY LeMarc quit because he was 75 years old, Isabel.
RUSTY He was tired.
RUSTY His doctor told him if he didn't start taking it easy he was going to have another heart attack.
RUSTY You're dramatizing it.
ISABEL You don't know why LeMarc retired, any better than I do.
ISABEL You have no idea.
RUSTY Actually, I do.
RUSTY I know exactly why.
ISABEL Really?
ISABEL How's that?
RUSTY He told me.
ISABEL You know LeMarc?
RUSTY A little.
ISABEL Since when?
RUSTY Ten years ago.
ISABEL For how long?
RUSTY For six months.
ISABEL You--
ISABEL She's so mad she can hardly speak.
ISABEL You knew LeMarc?
ISABEL You knew LeMarc and never told me?
ISABEL That's the worst thing you've ever done to me.
ISABEL Nobody knows more about LeMarc than me.
ISABEL How could you do that?
RUSTY I couldn't tell you, then.
ISABEL Really awful.
ISABEL Isabel thinks.
ISABEL Then why aren't you as good as Toulour?
ISABEL Rusty shrugs.
ISABEL A beat.
ISABEL I don't want to arrest you, Robert.
ISABEL I really don't.
ISABEL But I will if you make me.
ISABEL I will if you go for that egg.
ISABEL Rusty goes silent, looks out at the lights of the city.
ISABEL So many times, I waited.
ISABEL You can't do that to a person.
RUSTY Isabel--
ISABEL I have to go.
ISABEL Isabel gets up...walks away fast.
ISABEL She's barely holding herself together.
Rusty watches her go.
Several seconds, then:
Rusty carries a huge bouquet of flowers up the stairs to the front door of his apartment with Isabel.
It's a perfect sunny day outside.
He unlocks the door quietly and swings it open to see the apartment is bare.
The furniture is still there.
But nothing else.
Nothing on the walls or the shelves.
Isabel has clearly moved out.
Rusty's whole body reacts....
He slowly looks around him, as if in a dream.
His eye goes to the dining room table.
Isabel's engagement ring is there.
Rusty is still watching Isabel, small now in the distance.
She turns the corner out of sight.
Isabel pulls up in her car.
The Egg is being put into position.
Isabel watches.
Reuben is talking to Yen.
Frank and Livingston get ready in the background.
REUBEN You're a photographer.
REUBEN Very exacting.
REUBEN You want things a certain way, but you never raise your voice.
REUBEN You're uncompromising.
REUBEN Strong.
FRANK Reuben, what are you doing?
REUBEN Oh, we understand each other.
REUBEN I'm mean, the actual words are gibberish to me, but I know what he means.
REUBEN There's a tone, you know.
REUBEN We communicate.
REUBEN I'm sure he'd tell you the same thing.
REUBEN Am I right?
REUBEN Yen says something in Chinese.
Danny and the Malloys are looking at Tess's hair.
TURK I say we do a Joey Heatherton,
VIRGIL It's the wrong color.
VIRGIL Turk looks at his watch.
TURK Damn.
TURK There's a knock at the door.
TURK They let Tess check on it.
TURK She looks out the keyhole;
It's TOPHER GRACE.
Tess looks back to the group and shrugs.
TOPHER Hello?
TOPHER He knocks again.
TOPHER The group scrambles and hides.
TOPHER Tess opens the door.
TOPHER Hey!
TOPHER I got your room number from McCormick, I hope you don't mind.
TOPHER He walks in and hugs her.
TOPHER She looks terrified.
TOPHER Topher disengages and looks around.
TOPHER This is great.
TOPHER Do you have the adjoining room?
TESS Uh, no.
TOPHER Oh.
TOPHER Hey.
TOPHER I saw the rough cut of YOU ALWAYS, YOU NEVER.
TOPHER It's so awesome.
TOPHER Congratulations.
TESS Oh.
TESS Thank you.
TOPHER It was just like a dub of a lo-rez output, but I could totally see what you were doing.
TOPHER I think you might win again.
TOPHER Seriously.
TESS Oh.
TOPHER It really actually looked like you were blind.
TOPHER How did you do that?
TOPHER What is it like, an on-set thing, or was it digital?
TESS It was, uh...
TOPHER You can tell me, I won't tell a soul.
TOPHER Because if you say it's instinctual, I'm quitting right now.
TOPHER Seriously.
TOPHER The way you parted your hair?
TOPHER That was so connected.
TOPHER And that scene with the matches?
TOPHER And when you find out who your real grandmother is and run through the rain and find her on the porch and touch her face?
TOPHER Man, that was...you gotta tell Steven how much I loved it.
TESS Okay.
TOPHER So what are you doing?
TESS I'm, uh, getting ready to go out...
TOPHER I mean next.
TOPHER What movie are you doing next?
TESS I...I'm having trouble deciding what to do next.
TOPHER Is Danny working?
TESS Danny...Danny is...Danny is...
TOPHER Oh, no.
TOPHER Is something wrong?
TOPHER Have you two...
TESS No, no...
TOPHER I'm so sorry.
TOPHER I'm so sorry.
TESS No.
TESS we're absolutely fine, he's just--
TOPHER I've got to stop asking people about their spouses, it's like always a mistake--
TESS No, really--
TOPHER Listen, I won't say a word.
TOPHER Seriously.
TOPHER I'm rooting for you guys, you know that.
TOPHER This is your private business and I totally respect that.
TOPHER No more Danny questions from me.
TESS Thank you.
TESS He's fine.
TESS Danny's fine.
TESS He's working.
TOPHER Hey, cool, whatever.
TOPHER That's what I'll say.
TOPHER A beat.
TOPHER So can I come look at that Egg with you?
Reuben (dressed in a hip-hop outfit) and Linus (dressed like an agent) stand in front of some paparazzi.
A crowd of museum employees also rubberneck.
REUBEN My name is Stuart Feldman, Worldwide Executive Senior Vice- President of Marketing, Corporate Senior Vice-President of Publicity and Corporate International Executive Worldwide President of Promotion for the Warner Brothers Motion Picture company.
REUBEN My colleague, Grant Wells, who is responsible for Ms. Roberts itinerary, has graciously set aside time for Ms. Roberts to view the Coronation Egg privately.
Isabel, the Security Director, and Captain Giordano sit with four cops watching a bank of closed circuit screens.
ISABEL I want to be on record as saying that you should have shut the entire museum down.
ISABEL Isabel keeps her eye on the tourists who circulate through the other wings of the museum.
"Julia" arrives flanked by her "Nation of Islam" guards, Frank and Basher.
The assembled employees clap and call her name.
She waves as they take her picture.
Topher throws his arm around Julia to make sure he gets in all the shots.
The Museum Director comes up to greet "Julia".
Isabel watches the security camera feeds.
ISABEL There!
ISABEL Right there!
ISABEL Isabel points at a screen showing the museum's other entrance.
ISABEL Rusty nonchalantly slips into the museum.
"Julia" enters and walks up to the egg.
Her entourage follows.
TESS It's so beautiful.
TESS My God.
TESS Topher looks at the egg--
TOPHER Kinda small.
TOPHER He turns away to look a cute girl on the museum staff.
TOPHER Hi.
BACK ON "JULIA" She leans in close to the egg.
TESS I'm not going to set off any alarms?
MUSEUM DIRECTOR No.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR No.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR Get as close as you like.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR Reuben pops his head in between them.
REUBEN Julia -- unless you have any objections -- Wen and his crew set up for the publicity stills.
Rusty ponders a painting like college student trying to impress his art history professor.
Finally he moves on, into another gallery.
PAN to REVEAL nine uniformed cops trailing behind him.
Yen ENTERS FRAME -- dressed like a pretentious grunge rocker.
He whispers Chinese into a bullhorn.
Theoretically he's speaking to his crew (Danny, Saul, and Livingston in lame disguises) telling them where to set up the camera, lights, and flags.
Each "crew member" carries an odd-looking oversized "light meter".
Upon closer examination we can see that each device has a small TV screen on it -- which is tapped into the museum's closed circuit system.
The guys are carefully placing their flags and lights so as to block the view of the egg from each of the eight cameras on the ceiling of the gallery.
"Studio Execs," Reuben and Linus go to "Julia."
REUBEN I was thinking maybe we could get you and Topher into some "You Always You Never" hats and t-shirts for the shoot--
TESS That's stupid.
REUBEN So stupid!
REUBEN Idiot.
REUBEN Maybe we could put some posters in the background--
TESS I don't think we want to be so obvious--
REUBEN I completely agree!
REUBEN Stop trying to turn this into some sort of stunt.
Isabel struts up to Rusty.
ISABEL This isn't going to work.
RUSTY I don't know what you're talking about.
Yen stands on two apple boxes to shoot photos of "Julia" and Topher.
"Julia" looks ridiculously stiff and keeps putting her hands up to block her ears.
Topher keeps shooting glances at Danny, who is moving around flags and lights, ostensibly in accordance with Yen's Chinese language orders.
Julia sees Topher's expression -- he recognizes Danny from somewhere...
JULIA Okay, thanks everybody.
JULIA Thank you so much.
JULIA She starts to walk out.
JULIA Topher shrugs and follows her.
Julia and her entourage barrel down the hallway.
Topher catches up.
TOPHER Hey, J Ro, why the quick exit?
TESS I...uh, I have to take some pills.
TESS Aspirin.
TESS I get headaches.
TOPHER Yeah, well, with everything thing you've been going through I can see how you'd need something.
TESS They're just aspirin.
TOPHER Right.
TOPHER I've never taken aspirin in my life, ever.
TOPHER Can you believe that?
TESS That's amazing.
TOPHER For me, it's like a control thing.
TESS Well, with aspirin...it's very beneficial.
TOPHER Oh, yeah.
TOPHER I'm sure.
TOPHER They are interrupted by the sound of PIERCING SIRENS and CLANGING BELLS -- all manner of alarms coming from the gallery containing the egg.
Tess rushes back to the gallery just in time to see police officers pin Danny and his entire crew on the floor and against walls and start handcuffing them.
She freezes.
Can't move....
Her bodyguards (Frank and Basher ) grab her and move her quickly out of the area.
Three massive Ford Excursion SUV's with diplomatic plates double park out front, completely blocking the flow of traffic on the narrow street.
Eight FBI agents climb out of their behemoths and walk inside like they own the place.
The boss is a 55 year-old agent named MOLLY STARR.
Molly Starr steps inside with her posse.
She pulls out her badge and hangs it around her neck.
AGENT MOLLY STARR Who's in charge?
AGENT MOLLY STARR Isabel and Captain Giordano look at her and her team with obvious trepidation.
ISABEL I am.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO She is.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Molly gives a slight nod to one of her lackeys.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO He thrusts an official-looking paper at Isabel.
Molly swaggers down a hallway, followed by Isabel and Giordano.
She stops at an observation window and looks through it to see Danny, who is handcuffed to a chair, awaiting interrogation.
His expression is impassive.
She moves on to the next window: Yen.
Same impassive expression.
She continues down the line, Reuben, Livingston, and Saul.
Each has the same impassive expression.
Through the final window she sees Linus...
He's nervously tapping his foot.
Molly smiles sadistically.
AGENT MOLLY STARR Oh, yeah...
AGENT MOLLY STARR I'll start with him.
Molly sits face-to-face with Linus.
Isabel and Captain Giordano stand in the corner and observe.
AGENT MOLLY STARR When people think of Italy they think of food, wine, the Renaissance.
AGENT MOLLY STARR They don't realize Italy has the scariest prisons in the civilized world.
AGENT MOLLY STARR You know why?
AGENT MOLLY STARR They're all leftover from the Middle Ages.
AGENT MOLLY STARR They're worse than dirty; they're damp.
AGENT MOLLY STARR They're like caves.
AGENT MOLLY STARR Linus can't look her in the eye.
AGENT MOLLY STARR (cont'd) I'm the only hope you've got.
LINUS What do you want?
AGENT MOLLY STARR Testify against the others in the Benedict case.
LINUS I can't do that.
AGENT MOLLY STARR Sure you can.
AGENT MOLLY STARR You'll get a year, maybe two.
AGENT MOLLY STARR The Italian charges will be dropped.
AGENT MOLLY STARR You and the others will be extradited to the US this afternoon.
AGENT MOLLY STARR A long beat.
AGENT MOLLY STARR Think about those prisons.
AGENT MOLLY STARR Think about living there for twenty years, getting out when you're fifty.
AGENT MOLLY STARR What a catch you'll be.
Linus is bundled into the back of the SUV.
Agent Starr gets in next to him.
She motions to the driver.
They pull out.
Agent Starr's SUV is followed by three other SUV's and escorted by two Rome Police cars.
Linus stares morosely at the headrest in front of him.
A long, long beat...then he turns to Agent Starr:
LINUS Did you tell Dad?
LINUS Before "Agent Starr" answers the agent in the passenger seat turns around.
LINUS It's Clint Eastwood.
CLINT Of course she did.
CLINT We're married, for God's sake.
Tess waits.
A key sounds in the door, and she is on her feet.
She reaches Danny before he's all the way in the room.
She kisses him, then remembers she's mad at him.
TESS Why didn't you tell me?
DANNY I couldn't.
TESS Why not?
DANNY Because you're not an actress.
DANNY You wouldn't have been so real.
TESS I thought you were going to jail.
DANNY I'm not going to jail.
DANNY A beat.
TESS So you don't think I'm a good actress.
DANNY You're a terrible liar.
TESS I'm a good liar.
DANNY Where did Benedict find you?
TESS He...
DANNY At your parent's house.
TESS That was...okay, so I'm not a good liar.
TESS So what.
TESS You're good enough for both of us.
DANNY Exactly.
The motorcade of FBI SUV's pulls through the security gate and drives toward a US government Gulfstream parked on the flight line.
Isabel watches with Captain Giordino and Commander Andriotti.
Linus, Saul, Yen, Livingston and Reuben get out of the SUVs, all of them beaming.
They hug Linus's mom and dad and mount the steps to the plane.
Then Rusty gets out, says goodbye to everyone, and heads for Isabel.
ISABEL What the-- Oh my God!
ISABEL (cont'd) Call the tower!
ISABEL (cont'd) Don't let that plane take off!
ISABEL (cont'd) Giordano stares blankly at her.
ISABEL (cont'd) But he doesn't move.
ISABEL (cont'd) Do something!
ISABEL (cont'd) Do you realize what's happening?!
ISABEL (cont'd) Do you understand what's going on?!
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Yes, absolutely.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Isabel blinks.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO It takes a second to hit her.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Rusty approaches.
RUSTY Guys.
RUSTY Get on there before they leave without you.
RUSTY Thanks.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Hey, no problem.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO Good seeing you, man.
ANDRIOTTI Take care.
ANDRIOTTI See you back home.
RUSTY Thanks, Scooter.
RUSTY Isabel is dumbstruck.
Toulour pulls up in a Ferrari.
His butler gets the door for him.
BUTLER How was Rome, air?
BUTLER Toulour answers by handing a small velvet bag to his butler (a bag just big enough to hold the coronation egg).
TOULOUR Put this in the safe, would you?
BUTLER Of course, sir.
BUTLER Your guests are on the veranda.
TOULOUR Guests?
Isabel watches as the "US Government" Gulfstream containing all the members of Rusty's crew that she arrested at the museum taxis down the runway and becomes airborne.
She turns to Rusty.
ISABEL I hate you.
RUSTY I love you.
ISABEL This will ruin me.
RUSTY No, it won't.
RUSTY Not if you come to Zanzibar.
ISABEL What is it with Zanzibar?
RUSTY It's where LeMarc is.
RUSTY Rusty points nearby at another private plane.
RUSTY The pilot has just opened the door and put the stairs down.
RUSTY That one's ours.
RUSTY We can be there in three hours.
RUSTY A beat.
RUSTY Don't you want to meet him?
RUSTY He wants to meet you.
ISABEL You're asking me to turn my back on my whole life.
RUSTY Would you miss it?
ISABEL I'm a cop.
ISABEL That's who I am.
RUSTY You're only a cop because your father was a thief.
ISABEL Who died in a Russian jail.
RUSTY According to you mother.
ISABEL What does that mean?
RUSTY It means you should meet LeMarc.
Toulour walks out to find Danny and Tess chomping on gourmet nuts and sipping his special reserve brandy.
TOULOUR Let me guess, you decided you did want to give my lawyer a call.
TOULOUR But you lost his card.
TOULOUR Toulour holds out another card to Danny.
DANNY No, nothing like that.
DANNY We just came to collect our money.
TOULOUR Not only did you fail, half of your crew got pinched!
TOULOUR Your plan was not good.
TOULOUR And you don't look anything like Julia Roberts!
TOULOUR I mean your...
TOULOUR ...and your...
TOULOUR ...and your ears.
Toulour stops.
Danny and Tess just look at him.
Something about their demeanor is troubling.
Namely, that they look completely untroubled.
TOULOUR Oh, no.
TOULOUR You stole it on the way to Rome didn't you?
TOULOUR I stole a replica.
A repeat of the shot of the SMALL, SECURE BOX being taken to a truck.
The truck moves out of the garage and on to the street as before.
This time the shot continues over to a door on the side of the building.
A YOUNG KID emerges with a backpack over his shoulder.
The BACKPACK KID passes another guy, a NORMAL-LOOKING GUY, who, after a beat, follows Backpack Kid.
The Backpack Kid, followed by Normal-Looking Guy, walk through the terminal and get in line.
We swing over to see Normal Looking Guy #2 looking at them.
In motion.
We start on the Backpack Kid, who is reading a book.
The Backpack is beneath his legs.
Next to him sits LINUS.
Across from him is one of the Normal-Looking Guys.
The other Normal-Looking Guy is a row away, facing him.
Linus looks at the door of the car.
SAUL Is making his way through the door.
SAUL He looks drunk.
LINUS Looks down at his copy of the French FHM.
Gets close and closer to Linus and the Backpack Kid.
LINUS Puts his magazine away.
SAUL Is almost to Linus's row, he stumbles a little, almost falls.
SAUL Then, with a loud WHOOSH the train goes completely dark.
SAUL It's gone into a tunnel.
SAUL We hear Saul's voice CRY OUT.
SAUL In a few seconds, the train exits the tunnel and the lights come back on.
SAUL Has fallen into the lap of the BackPack kid.
SAUL Linus and the Normal-Looking Guy try to help him up.
SAUL He stumbles onward and collapses into a vacant seat.
LINUS He's completely drunk.
LINUS The BackPack Kid nods his head.
LINUS Linus goes back to his book.
LINUS We drop down to see HIS BACKPACK also beneath his feet.
Linus walks through the terminal, backpack over his shoulder.
Suddenly he stops and kneels to tie his shoelace.
Saul, seeing this and reacting, splits off into another direction.
Linus and Saul approach the group.
DANNY What happened?
DANNY Linus puts his BACKPACK down.
LINUS We thought someone was following us.
TOULOUR But that means you knew what to steal before LeMarc proposed that I challenge you for it.
TOULOUR That means...
The image from the beginning of the film, with Rusty watching the boiling cask.
He's talking on the phone.
RUSTY Gaspar, it's Rusty.
RUSTY How are you?
And this time we see what be is working on:
A PERFECT REPLICA OF THE CORONATION EGG. In the warehouse in NYC, we see Danny and Rusty "arguing",
but from a different angle.
They are smiling as they yell:
TOULOUR LeMarc told you.
TOULOUR Of course.
TOULOUR He looks deflated.
TOULOUR It's probably just occurring to him that he's never lost before.
TOULOUR He sits down.
TOULOUR To teach me.
TOULOUR He is silent.
TOULOUR Tess indicates to Danny that they should leave.
TOULOUR Danny nods, and they rise.
DANNY Well, we'll be in touch to make all the arrangements.
TOULOUR No.
TOULOUR Don't go.
TOULOUR Please.
TOULOUR Toulour gets up.
TOULOUR You are my guests.
TOULOUR I will celebrate your victory.
TOULOUR Besides, you may have noticed, I don't like to be alone.
They are toasting champagne.
TOULOUR I am feeling more French by the minute.
TOULOUR To my first depression.
Saul and Basher ride to the airport.
BASHER So I think if you really analyze it, you can see that it's inevitable.
BASHER It's time for us to evolve, en masse.
BASHER I have to help bring that about whatever way I can, you know.
BASHER Otherwise, the trajectory is fixed.
BASHER You know what I'm saying?
SAUL Mmm.
SAUL Yes.
SAUL But I'm through evolving, I think.
SAUL It's too tiring.
SAUL I feel pretty evolved.
SAUL You know, considering.
Frank and Yen buy magazines.
Yen has a copy of an ITALIAN TABLOID.
The headline screams CO-STAR SAYS JULIA MARRIAGE IN TROUBLE.
A sub-headline reads HER ADDICTION TO PAINKILLERS IS
In First Class.
Basher and Saul tip champagne glasses.
Virgil, Turk, and Linus all crack open copies of their story to read.
TURK I've got an idea for another Dominique story.
VIRGIL Can we finish this one first?
TURK Just let me tell it to you.
VIRGIL No.
TURK It's like three sentences.
VIRGIL I'm serious; you're asking too much.
VIRGIL Virgil puts on his headset.
VIRGIL Turk leans over to Linus and begins to speak.
VIRGIL Linus, reading, holds his finger up.
VIRGIL Yen reads a magazine.
VIRGIL Reuben glances at it.
REUBEN May I look at that when you're through with it?
REUBEN Yen says something.
REUBEN It would seem he is okay with that.
REUBEN Livingston speaks into his VOICE RECORDER.
LIVINGSTON All in all, it was depressingly familiar.
LIVINGSTON The forced camaraderie, the hollow smiles.
LIVINGSTON Scared to take a moment's reflection.
LIVINGSTON Scared to imagine a different life.
LIVINGSTON We behaved like boys.
LIVINGSTON But...
He begins to weep, quietly, but very quickly regains his composure.
LIVINGSTON I'm Livingston Dell.
LIVINGSTON Thanks for listening.
Tess and Danny enjoy the sunrise.
TESS When do you want to go back?
DANNY Feel like traveling?
TESS Yeah.
TESS Don't you?
DANNY Yeah.
DANNY Toulour enters with THE LAST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in tow.
TOULOUR Tess.
TOULOUR Danny.
TOULOUR This is Monica Bellucci.
TOULOUR And indeed it is.
MONICA Hello.
TESS & DANNY Hello.
TOULOUR We're thinking of taking a trip to the states.
TOULOUR Take a look around.
TOULOUR We'd love to meet some of your friends while we're there.
TOULOUR Actually, one friend in particular.
We follow the Gulfstream jet.
Isabel looks out the window.
Rusty watches her, She looks over at him, then back out the window.
Stunning.
Classic.
Rusty and Isabel pull up.
He takes her hand and leads her inside.
Rusty and Isabel walk through the house.
RUSTY There he is.
RUSTY Rusty indicates the back porch.
RUSTY A figure sits in a lounge chair, reading a book.
RUSTY This is LEMARC.
RUSTY (cont'd) Gaspar!
ISABEL Gaspar?
ISABEL That was my fa--
ISABEL Isabel looks to the porch just as LE MARC, her father, turns to face her.
ISABEL She goes to him and they embrace.
ISABEL (cont'd) Daddy.
ISABEL (cont'd) LeMarc looks to Rusty.
ISABEL (cont'd) Rusty salutes, makes a drinking gesture and heads for the kitchen.
ISABEL (cont'd) The sound of a jet takes us to
As we rotate from Toulour's villa to LAS VEGAS, NEVADA
Of the Bellagio hotel.
For a wire transfer of $ 191,507,067.37 into the account of TB ENTERPRISES.
Description: "Repayment of personal loan".
Staring at this receipt.
He looks up.
REUBEN Is opposite him.
REUBEN They are both being served for lunch by a JACKETED WAITER, whose face is continually obscured.
REUBEN That's the exact figure, I'm pretty sure.
BENEDICT Yes.
REUBEN So we're clean?
BENEDICT You want it in writing?
REUBEN I'll take your word.
BENEDICT You're clean.
REUBEN These grudges, they're awful.
REUBEN Nobody wine.
BENEDICT As soon as someone retaliates, the situation is out of control.
REUBEN This way, there's no need for retaliation.
REUBEN Why would there be?
BENEDICT There's plenty for everyone.
REUBEN More than plenty.
REUBEN It's just a matter of sharing.
BENEDICT Sharing is good.
REUBEN It is.
REUBEN Waiter?
REUBEN Can I get sparkling water?
REUBEN It's good for my acid reflux.
WAITER Of course.
WAITER The waiter turns toward the bar and we see now that he is FRANCOIS TOULOUR.
WAITER He's wearing a STRIPED TULIP in his
