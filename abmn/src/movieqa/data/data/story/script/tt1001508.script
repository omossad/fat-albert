HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU
Written by

July 20, 2007
We float down through a serene, leafy park to the children's play area.
There, in the sandbox, a BEAUTIFUL FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL plays among a group of kids.
GIGI (V.O.) I have a theory about how this all started...
A SIX YEAR OLD BOY approaches.
He watches the little girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle.
And then - out of nowhere - THE LITTLE BOY PUSHES THE
LITTLE GIRL Why did you do that?
LITTLE BOY Because you smell like dog poo.
Some of the other kids SNICKER at this brilliant one- liner.
Our little girl's face turns red.
LITTLE BOY (CONT'D) You're so stupid just like dog poo!
LITTLE BOY (CONT'D) You're made of poo!
And then, just to punctuate, he JUMPS ON THE SANDCASTLE, smashing it.
Finally, our little girl starts to CRY.
Our beautiful girl sits at a kitchen table with her MOM.
She can only get out one syllable between big, wet sobs.
LITTLE GIRL Made.
LITTLE GIRL (SOB) Of.
LITTLE GIRL (SOB) Dog.
LITTLE GIRL (SOB) Poo.
MOM Honey, do you know why that little boy did those things?
MOM And said those things?
The little girl shakes her head no.
MOM (CONT'D) Because he LIKES YOU.
GIGI (V.O.) Uh - excuse me -- but what - the - HELL?
GIGI (V.O.) Where did that rumor start?
GIGI (V.O.) Because moms have been spreading it for years.
MOM That little boy is doing those terrible things because he HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.
We see our little girl take this in, like she is just now beginning to understand the ways of the world.
GIGI (V.O.) Do you understand what this means?
GIGI (V.O.) We are all encouraged to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk -- that means he likes you.
GIGI (V.O.) Sure, that's a lesson that might serve us as five year olds, but many of us keep believing this advice well into adulthood.
A CUTE COLLEGE GIRL sits CRYING in front of her ANSWERING MACHINE, as her ROOMMATE looks on.
GIGI (V.O.) Then, as we get older, we carry on this tradition of misreading the signals men send by encouraging our friends to do the same...
The machine evilly flashes 0 in the NEW MESSAGES window.
ROOMMATE #1 That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.
ROOMMATE #1 I'm sure he just lost your number.
A HOT EXECUTIVE WOMAN stands in the office hallway, watching a SEXY MALE COLLEAGUE walk by.
He does not give her a second glance.
Her FEMALE SECRETARY looks on.
SECRETARY He's not asking you out because he's intimidated by your professional success and emotional maturity.
A BUNCH OF TWENTY-SOMETHINGS sipping cocktails.
One of them is CRYING - smeared mascara, puffy eyes, etc.
CUTE TWENTYSOMETHING #1 Here's the problem.
CUTE TWENTYSOMETHING #1 He likes you TOO much.
CUTE TWENTYSOMETHING #1 You're TOO pretty and awesome.
CUTE TWENTYSOMETHING #1 He can't handle it.
CASHIER #1 Trust me.
CASHIER #1 It's because he's just getting out of a serious relationship.
TWO MIDDLE AGED WOMEN work out on ellipticals.
MIDDLE AGED WOMAN #1 Trust me.
MIDDLE AGED WOMAN #1 It's because he's never had a serious relationship.
TWO HIPSTER JAPANESE GIRLS making their way through a crowded Tokyo department store.
TOKYO GIRL #1 (SUBTITLE) Shigeru's inability to commit clearly stems from his failure to properly imprint on his mother during breast feeding.
A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN weaves BANANA LEAVES with a FRIEND.
FRIEND (SUBTITLE) I'm sure he forgot your hut number.
FRIEND (SUBTITLE) Or didn't get enough approval from his father.
FRIEND (SUBTITLE) Or was eaten by a giraffe.
This last part seems to cheer up the pretty woman.
GIGI (V.O.) Why do we say this stuff to each other?
GIGI (V.O.) Why do we tell each other these lies?
(CONT'D) Is it possible that it's because we're too scared, and it's too hard, to say the one obvious truth that's staring everyone in the face?
GIGI, pretty and approachable, sits in a booth at a hip Mt.
Vernon date spot with CONOR, cute but holding onto his frat boy roots.
They sip their near empty cocktails.
GIGI So, Janine told me you're a real estate agent.
CONOR Yeah.
CONOR But don't worry - not one of the cheesy ones who puts his headshot on bus benches and grocery carts.
GIGI So just like on frisbees and notepads?
Conor laughs.
Gigi smiles -- she's doing well.
CONOR You got it.
GIGI Much classier.
CONOR My thoughts exactly.
Gigi sips her drink, and looks at Conor.
GIGI I wonder why Janine never thought of introducing us before?
CONOR Yeah, I don't know, I ummm -
Their WAITRESS appears, cutting him off.
WAITRESS You guys ready for another round?
Conor looks to Gigi.
CONOR You want one more?
GIGI Only if you do.
GIGI But I mean, if you have to get going I totally ...
Gigi trails off.
Conor considers this for a LONG MOMENT.
We can see on Gigi's face that she knows that the outcome of this date hangs in the balance.
It's an eternity.
CONOR Umm.
CONOR OK.
CONOR Sure.
CONOR One more.
Gigi breathes a SIGH of relief.
CONOR (CONT'D) You had Ketel and soda, right?
Gigi NODS and SMILES, clearly flattered that Conor remembered her order.
She scoots a little closer to him.
Gigi and Conor HUG outside the restaurant.
GIGI Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.
CONOR Yeah.
CONOR It was really nice meeting you.
GIGI B-bye.
Gigi waves flirtatiously and walks away, smiling.
She turns around to look, and sees Conor TAKE HIS CELL
Gigi TAKES HER CELL OUT OF HER PURSE and dials.
GIGI (CONT'D) Hey, it's me.
GIGI (CONT'D) He's cute.
GIGI (CONT'D) I think it went well.
She sneaks another look over her shoulder to see Conor.
GIGI (CONT'D) And I think he might me leaving me a message at home as - we - speak.
We FREEZE FRAME ON GIGI, mid-step.
Then, THE IMAGE
CONOR - also in FREEZE FRAME.
The image UNFREEZES and we continue with Conor as he DIALS HIS CELL PHONE.
CONOR Hey, it's me...I just wanted you to know that I was thinking about you.
ANNA, hot in an earthy sort of way, heads down the aisle.
She holds her cell phone in one hand - a BOTTLED WATER and a BAG OF SOY NUTS in the other.
ANNA Conor, that's so nice.
ANNA Thank you.
As Anna gets to the checkout, there's one person ahead of her.
He looks back to see her - he's BEN, good looking and supremely likeable.
They share a smile.
BEN Do you want to go ahead?
ANNA Hmm?
BEN Go ahead?
BEN You've only got two things.
ANNA Hold on.
She looks at what he's got - a SIX PACK OF SIERRA NEVADA.
ANNA (CONT'D) You've only got one thing.
BEN Well, technically it's six.
BEN And I'm still mulling over a gum purchase.
BEN So...
He steps aside to let her go.
She smiles.
ANNA Hey, let me call you right back.
She hangs up the phone and moves past Ben, hands her things to the EMOTIONLESS CASHIER.
As he rings them up - she looks back at Ben - they SHARE ANOTHER LOOK.
She hands the cashier her ATM card - he swipes it.
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER Oh my word.
ANNA Come on.
ANNA Seriously.
ANNA I just deposited money today.
ANNA There's no way -
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER It's not that.
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER Let me check something.
He turns and rifles through a stack of papers, finally finding what he was looking for.
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER Congratulations.
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER You won.
ANNA What?
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER Our "Sizzlin' Summer" promotion.
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER You're our 1000th customer in June.
The cashier reaches under the register and pulls out an IGLOO COOLER and hands it to Anna.
She BEAMS.
ANNA Are you kidding?
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER Do I have that kind of manner?
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER A joking manner?
Anna looks to Ben.
She looks like she's about to burst.
ANNA I swear to god, this is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me.
Ben can't tell if she's kidding.
BEN Really?
ANNA Is that sad?
BEN No, it's - charming.
BEN Congratulations.
Anna smiles wide, admiring her cooler.
Then -
ANNA Wait, no.
ANNA I can't accept this.
ANNA You were here first.
ANNA I didn't win at all.
BEN Yes, you did.
BEN Trust me - it's fate.
BEN You were meant to have that cooler.
Anna throws her arms around him and hugs him.
ANNA Thank you SO MUCH.
Ben can't help but laugh.
Conor enters his apartment.
ALEX sits on the couch watching TV.
ALEX Hey.
ALEX How was the date?
CONOR Fine.
CONOR You know.
Conor heads for the kitchen, and turns back.
CONOR (CONT'D) Why are you here?
ALEX My cable's out.
Conor returns from the kitchen with a beer.
CONOR You didn't hear the phone ring, did you?
ALEX Nope.
CONOR Shit.
CONOR Anna gave me the "I'll call you right back."
ALEX How long ago?
CONOR 22 minutes.
Alex winces.
ALEX Sorry, dude.
CONOR Do I call back?
Alex shrugs.
CONOR (CONT'D) I know.
CONOR (CONT'D) I'll call back and say that I'm going to bed.
ALEX At 9:30 PM?
ALEX Genius.
It is genius.
Because then I can say: "In case you were going to call me back - don't - 'cause I'll be sleeping."
ALEX Sounds foolproof.
Conor pulls off his jacket and tosses it next to a box - which contains about 50 FRISBEES.
On each frisbee:
Conor dials his cell phone as he heads back to his room.
We TILT up to find Anna and Ben.
Anna looks at her phone, presses IGNORE and stashes it in her purse.
ANNA Sorry.
ANNA What was I saying?
BEN I think you were telling me how you don't want to be like your mom and wake up and realize you didn't pursue your dreams.
Ben opens his GUM and offers Anna a piece.
She takes one and laughs, a bit embarrassed.
ANNA Was I?
ANNA Little intense for grocery store chatter.
ANNA Sorry.
BEN It's OK.
BEN I might even be able to help you out.
BEN There's a guy at my firm who has exclusively music clients.
ANNA That would be - amazing.
ANNA What are you - like my savior?
Anna digs through her purse to find a piece of paper.
She writes down her number, and holds it out to him.
He looks at it, contemplating.
He doesn't take it.
BEN OK.
BEN Look.
BEN I'm married.
BEN I don't do this.
ANNA Don't do what?
ANNA Help struggling singers?
BEN Help hot Pilates instructing singers who happen to be very charming.
Anna takes the slip of paper and puts it away.
ANNA Do you want to give me your card?
ANNA That's legit.
ANNA I bet you're allowed to do that.
Ben considers this.
BEN Right.
BEN OK.
BEN I guess that would be OK.
We see Anna and Ben talking.
They shake hands awkwardly and Ben HEADS TOWARDS US.
Ben gets in the car, bag in hand, and joins NEIL, 40, arty and kind looking, who's behind the wheel.
NEIL So, who was that?
BEN A prospective client.
NEIL Yeah right.
BEN I can talk to a woman Neil.
BEN It doesn't have to be like that.
Neil looks at him, smirk growing.
BEN (CONT'D) Just drive.
Neil starts the car and they pull away.
Neil walks into a vast space.
Nice art, a cozy yet architectural look - a cool place to live.
NEIL Hey, babe.
NEIL You here?
We PAN over to a couch - where BETH is wrapped in a throw blanket, watching TV.
She's got her hair in a messy bun.
BETH Hey honey.
He joins her on the couch.
And sees that the TV is off.
NEIL Everything OK?
BETH Yeah.
BETH Just got off the phone.
Neil gets up again.
NEIL You want some tea or something?
BETH It was my baby sister.
BETH She's getting married.
NEIL That's great.
NEIL I've always liked that Devon guy.
NEIL That's really great.
Beth looks at him.
She doesn't look that happy.
BETH Do you think it's great?
NEIL Yeah.
BETH So, you think it's great that they're getting married, but you never feel like we're going against nature or something by not getting married?
NEIL No, babe.
He sits back down, puts his arms around her.
NEIL (CONT'D) Going against nature is like that cat who started nursing that monkey.
NEIL (CONT'D) We're just two people who aren't married.
Beth manages a weak smile.
BETH Right.
NEIL I actually think the odds of having a successful relationship increase by not getting married.
NEIL Look at my parents - all marriage got them was thirty two years of misery and joint checking.
BETH Yeah, I know.
BETH I get that.
NEIL Like I've always told you - I love you - and we don't need a marriage certificate to legitimize our relationship.
BETH Yeah.
NEIL Lemme get you some tea.
He exits.
Beth starts to CRY, but quickly dries her tears, and forces herself to pull it together.
A brick row house in an up and coming neighborhood - clearly under massive renovation.
We make our way through rooms with plastic covering the doorways - until we find JANINE stepping into the hallway.
She checks herself in a vintage mirror, straightens it a tad, then heads down the stairs to find GIGI, on her cell phone.
Gigi slams it closed.
JANINE OK, so clearly he hasn't called.
Gigi shakes her head.
JANINE (CONT'D) Maybe he's away on business.
GIGI He sells real estate.
GIGI In Baltimore.
GIGI Staying in town is his business.
JANINE Right.
Janine ponders this.
JANINE (CONT'D) Look, let me tell you - after the first time I went out with Ben, he didn't call me for eleven days.
JANINE (CONT'D) ELEVEN DAYS.
JANINE (CONT'D) And now he's like the world's best husband.
JANINE (CONT'D) That happens all the time.
GIGI Really?
JANINE Yes, really.
Gigi manages a small smile.
GIGI This is all your fault.
JANINE What?
JANINE Why?
GIGI You set me up with him.
JANINE No - you asked if I knew any guys and I gave Conor your number.
JANINE That's not a set up.
JANINE When I do a set up - I weigh pros and cons.
JANINE I do my due diligence.
JANINE All I know about Conor is he sold us this house.
Gigi peers out the window.
GIGI He sold you a house in the ghetto.
JANINE It's a neighborhood "in transition."
Gigi makes a move for the phone, Janine stops her.
JANINE (CONT'D) Seriously, stop.
GIGI He said he always hangs at Red Maple after work.
GIGI Maybe I should do a little drive-by?
JANINE Please, don't.
JANINE He'll call.
Off Gigi - panic seeping in.
AMBER, pretty if a little thick in the middle, sits in the courtyard of an office park in her work clothes.
AMBER Caller ID was the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
AMBER Total invasion of my personal freedom.
AMBER When a guy doesn't call me, it is my right - my duty even - to call him and hang up several thousand times.
AMBER Or at least until his mother shouts at me in Albanian and blows a police whistle into the phone.
AMBER I mean, calling and hanging up is an age old expression of love and frustration and too many wine coolers - and who is AT& f'ing T to take that away from me?
AMBER (CONT'D) Next thing you know, someone is going to ban me from sitting in my car in front of a guy's house, blaring "Where Is Your Heart" by Kelly Clarkson until his new stupid girlfriend comes outside and threatens to scratch my eyes out with her acrylics.
AMBER (CONT'D) I mean, a girl deserves freedom of expression, right?
Pilates class.
We pan down the row of mats, STUDENTS obediently doing The Mermaid.
We finally land on Gigi's mat: Gigi manages to twist herself into a passable Mermaid - as her CELL PHONE lies in full view on her mat.
Shower is on, curtain pulled.
A CELL PHONE RINGS.
An ARM SHOOTS out of the shower and grabs it from the sink.
GIGI Mom, I gotta call you back.
Gigi lays in bed, her CELL PHONE right next to her head.
One eye POPS OPEN, checks the phone, and closes again.
A typical, corporate style office.
Walled off cubicles for the junior execs, outer offices for management.
Gigi is in her cubicle.
Janine, her friend and, we now learn, co-worker, sits on Gigi's desk.
JANINE So, this was at the end of the date, or at the beginning?
GIGI End.
GIGI Why - does it matter?
JANINE Yeah.
JANINE "Nice meeting you" at the beginning of the date is normal.
JANINE "Nice meeting you" at the end could be a blow off.
GIGI Maybe it was at the beginning.
JANINE Then that's fine.
JANINE He's gonna call.
GIGI Or maybe it was at the end.
GIGI Or maybe it was nice to meet me.
JANINE Wait - was it "nice meeting you" or "nice to meet you"?
GIGI Shit.
GIGI I can't remember.
JANINE "Nice to meet you" is OK.
JANINE "Nice meeting you" is like "Do you want your receipt in the bag?"
The girls look up to find BETH standing there, listening.
BETH Remember the days when you guys at least pretended to be working when I came in?
Beth heads to her office.
Janine and Gigi follow.
BETH (CONT'D) Janine, how's the press release?
Janine, clearly organized, flips open her notebook:
JANINE Beckon the baking to begin!
JANINE McCormick, the flavor expert, introduces five fun filled flavors that will definitely delight dessert divas!
Gigi stifles a laugh.
BETH Maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration - but otherwise good.
BETH Where are we with the company newsletter?
GIGI I am so almost done with that.
GIGI It's just been a little hard to focus on my article about the two sets of twins in market research, when the guy - who may or may not be the guy of my dreams - refuses to call me.
Beth looks at Gigi, more sympathetic friend than boss.
BETH Look, after my first date with Neil, I called him.
BETH There are no rules anymore.
BETH Why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass?
Gigi sits at her desk, Janine standing by her side.
She's got a few sheets of paper on her desk.
Gigi takes a deep breath, picks up the office phone and dials.
Janine gives her a thumbs up.
GIGI It's ringing.
JANINE Pretty standard.
GIGI Yes!
GIGI Voicemail.
JANINE Your notes.
Gigi nods - it's all under control.
GIGI Hey, Conor.
GIGI It's Gigi.
GIGI I just thought, I hadn't heard from you and, I mean how stupid is it that a gal has got to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?
Gigi laughs, but as she looks back to the notes, she seems confused.
She turns to Janine, panicked, mouthing - "What does this say?".
Janine looks - she's no help.
GIGI (CONT'D) I mean, we're all equal, right?
GIGI (CONT'D) More than equal -- more women are accepted into law school now than men, and we do better in those police simulations where you can mistakenly shoot innocent people -
GIGI (CONT'D) - I mean I don't know if you saw that Dateline - but women practically have penises now, right?
GIGI (CONT'D) Well, call me.
GIGI (CONT'D) This is Gigi.
GIGI (CONT'D) Call me.
Gigi hangs up, unsure.
She looks to Janine.
JANINE Don't worry.
JANINE He's totally gonna call.
Gigi stares at the PHONE.
Then she feigns disinterest in the phone.
It still doesn't ring.
Finally, she picks up the receiver to listen for a dial tone.
And PANICS.
GIGI WHAT?
GIGI How can there be no dial tone?
She frantically jiggles the cord, then hears something.
GIGI (CONT'D) Mom?
GIGI (CONT'D) Is that you?
GIGI (CONT'D) I can't talk now.
GIGI (CONT'D) I'll call you back.
She hangs up, stares at the phone again.
A look of DETERMINATION crosses her face.
She dials.
GIGI (CONT'D) Janine.
GIGI (CONT'D) It's me.
GIGI (CONT'D) Conor never called, so I'm on the precipice of staging a casual run-in at Red Maple.
GIGI (CONT'D) Pick up if you want to stop me.
ALRIGHT-I'M-INTERPRETING-YOUR-SILENCE-AS tacit-compliance-bye.
Gigi hurriedly hangs up, and heads out the door.
A CROWDED, SCENEY restaurant/bar - with a giant red Japanese maple growing behind the bar (thus the name).
We follow a THIN, BLACK CLAD HOSTESS as we wind through the throng of stylish twentysomethings at the bar to:
A busy kitchen.
Off the kitchen a door leads to:
ALEX sits at a small, cluttered desk, rifling through some papers.
Then, from the doorway:
KELLI ANN Knock knock.
Alex looks up to see KELLI ANN - Red Maple's hot hostess, standing in the doorway.
She makes her way in.
ALEX Hey.
KELLI ANN So.
KELLI ANN Here we are.
KELLI ANN Same shift again.
ALEX I know.
ALEX I make the schedule.
KELLI ANN I figured it was no coincidence.
She leans against the desk.
Alex keeps working.
KELLI ANN (CONT'D) I had fun the other night.
ALEX Yeah.
ALEX It's amazing where 10 shots of Patron will get you.
Kelli Ann laughs, then thinks - wait, was that nice?
KELLI ANN Anyway - I was thinking, maybe tonight after work...we could, you know...
Alex stops what he's doing, looks up at her.
ALEX Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between us the other night was - fun.
ALEX But we're way understaffed tonight - I even have to man the bar - and that's why I scheduled you.
ALEX To work.
ALEX So...
He goes back to work.
Kelli Ann stands there, frozen.
Alex can feel her eyes on him.
ALEX (CONT'D) Are we good here?
Kelli Ann's face goes flush.
She tries to hide it.
She backs up, puts on a smile.
KELLI ANN No.
KELLI ANN We're good.
She leaves.
Alex exhales, goes back to work.
In the back doorway leading to the alley, Alex stands chatting with TYRONE, 18, a busboy, who smokes a cigarette he holds just outside the doorway.
Kelli Ann approaches, trying to squeeze through, and
He has to take a step to catch his balance.
He turns around to see what happened, but Kelli Ann keeps walking eyes front.
He and Tyrone share a look.
TYRONE Dude.
ALEX I know.
Tyrone laughs as Alex shakes his head, not happy.
Gigi enters slowly, looking around, searching for Conor.
She tries to move toward the bar as she's met by Kelli Ann, who grabs a few menus and slaps on a smile.
KELLI ANN Are you joining us for dinner or -
GIGI I'm meeting someone.
GIGI A guy.
KELLI ANN Ugh.
KELLI ANN Why?
GIGI Hmmmm?
KELLI ANN Nothing.
KELLI ANN Sorry.
KELLI ANN For dinner?
Gigi continues to scan the place, not paying attention.
GIGI I'm meeting someone.
KELLI ANN I believe you mentioned that.
Gigi finishes her visual tour of the room - no Conor.
GIGI I'm gonna wait at the bar.
KELLI ANN That's a great idea.
Gigi walks off.
Kelli Ann takes her place behind the hostess stand.
Gigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door.
Alex, now behind the bar, approaches.
ALEX What can I get you?
GIGI Oh, that's OK.
GIGI I'm meeting someone.
Alex takes her in.
She's clearly nervous.
ALEX Oh, yeah?
ALEX Got a hot date?
GIGI I don't know if you'd call it hot -- I mean this guy Conor and I have only been out the one time so --
ALEX Wait - Conor Barry?
Gigi is busted.
GIGI Oh, uhh, yeah --
ALEX Conor's not coming in tonight.
ALEX Did he forget he was supposed to meet you?
GIGI See when I said "meeting someone" I guess that was kind of a broad term, kind of a wide interpretation of the word "meeting"-
ALEX Because I could just call him --
Alex reaches for the phone.
GIGI NO!
GIGI I mean, totally unnecessary.
GIGI I mean, I actually was just - in the area - so I figured I'd just swing by and see if he was around - because - uhhh ---
Alex waits, looking at Gigi, amused.
She is panicking.
GIGI (CONT'D) I uhh, had to return his --
Gigi frantically searches her coat pockets - searching for something, anything - and finally fishes out A PEN.
She looks at it - and decides to go with it.
GIGI (CONT'D) Pen.
GIGI (CONT'D) I had to return this - pen.
GIGI (CONT'D) He left this.
GIGI (CONT'D) So, I thought I should really return it before he - you know -
GIGI (CONT'D) -- freaks out.
Alex looks at her skeptically.
And then takes the PEN, and inspects it.
ALEX Dr. Frankel - Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry.
GIGI Look, I'm not gonna judge about what may or may not be important to someone.
ALEX That's not even his dentist.
GIGI Oh, really?
GIGI Then who's his dentist?
ALEX My dad.
Gigi looks at Alex for a long moment, and finally folds.
GIGI I'm Gigi.
GIGI Conor and I went out last week.
GIGI And I just...I thought if I ran into him...I don't know.
GIGI I'm gonna go.
Gigi struggles to get out quickly.
Alex looks at her - holding her pen, looking quite frazzled - and softens.
ALEX Hey.
ALEX Just - hang out for a second.
ALEX Lemme buy you a drink.
Gigi SMILES and sits back down.
It's late.
The bar is nearly empty.
Alex is totaling receipts - and Gigi is still nursing a drink.
ALEX Look, you seem like a cool girl, so I'm just gonna be honest - Conor is never going to call you.
GIGI Oh really?
GIGI How do you know?
ALEX Because I'm a guy.
ALEX It's how we do it.
GIGI He said it was nice meeting me.
ALEX I don't care if he said you were his favorite female since his mommy and Joanie Cunningham.
ALEX Over a week went by - and he didn't call.
GIGI But maybe he called me and I didn't get the message.
GIGI Or maybe he lost my number, or was out of town, or was hit by a cab, or his grandma died.
ALEX Or maybe he just didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again.
GIGI Yeah but my friend Terri once went out with this guy who never called and she totally wrote him off - then like a year later she ran into him --
ALEX Your friend Terri's an idiot.
ALEX And she's the exception.
GIGI OK.
GIGI But what if I'm the exception?
ALEX You're not.
ALEX You're the rule.
ALEX And the rule is - if a guy doesn't call you, he doesn't want to call you.
GIGI Really?
GIGI Always?
ALEX Yeah.
ALEX Always.
ALEX I know what blowing off a woman looks like.
ALEX I do it early and I do it often.
ALEX Trust me - if a guy is treating you like he doesn't give a shit - - he doesn't.
ALEX No exceptions.
Gigi thinks this over.
GIGI Why are you telling me all of this?
GIGI Aren't these man-secrets - like why men need to watch televised golf?
Alex LAUGHS.
ALEX I don't know.
ALEX You looked like you could really use the help.
GIGI Thank you.
GIGI You've given me a lot to think about.
Gigi smiles at him.
Gigi comes in - carrying a MESSY HANDFUL OF PAPERS, with crazy hair and wearing the last outfit we saw her in.
JANINE Everything OK?
GIGI I was up all night.
JANINE Please say you were working on the newsletter.
GIGI Sure.
GIGI It's basically done.
GIGI But this is important.
JANINE What's happening with your hair?
Beth comes out of her office and looks at Gigi.
BETH Please come in my office before the others see that you have mini muffin stuck in your hair.
Gigi paces in front of Beth's desk.
GIGI I think I figured it out.
GIGI Remember when I went out with that notary public?
GIGI And he cheated on me?
GIGI And then Anastasia from upstairs told us that story about how her boyfriend cheated on her at the beginning - but then he totally changed and they're married and crazy in love.
BETH I thought that guy was a process server.
GIGI No, notary.
GIGI Anyway, the point is - Anastasia is the exception.
GIGI Not the rule.
GIGI We have to stop listening to these stories - because the rule is that most guys who cheat on you up front don't really care about you very much.
BETH Okay...
Gigi consults her crumpled pieces of paper.
GIGI Exhibit A: Chad, the drummer who lived in his storage space.
GIGI He only used me for rides, yet I continued to stalk him for most of 1998.
GIGI Then there was Don, who broke up with me every Friday so he could have his weekends free.
GIGI I was so delusional about our relationship that I referred to him as my husband to random people like my dental hygenist.
GIGI (CONT'D) And all my friends would tell me stories about how things might work out with these dipshits because they knew someone who knew someone who dated a dipshit just like mine, and that girl ended up getting married and living happily ever after.
GIGI (CONT'D) But that's the exception.
GIGI (CONT'D) And we're not the exception - we're the rule.
Gigi sits down, spent.
But Beth has been listening.
BETH OK.
BETH So let me see if I understand.
BETH What you're saying is that when people tell me about some girl they know who dated a guy for thirteen years, and then he finally married her -- that's the exception.
BETH And the rule is that guys - like Neil - who are with girls - like me - for seven years without getting married - are never getting married.
Beth is serious.
Gigi freezes, tries to backtrack.
GIGI No.
GIGI No, no, no.
GIGI That's not what I'm saying.
GIGI This has absolutely nothing to do with you.
GIGI I was just talking, you know, about me.
GIGI Specifically.
Off Beth, knowing it's about her, too.
Anna and MARY, beautiful but doesn't know it, sit in side by side pedicure chairs.
Anna holds a BUSINESS CARD.
ANNA It is impossible not to like this guy.
ANNA I'm pretty sure he was heavily flirting with me outside Eddie's, and then he tells me he's married.
ANNA You'd think I'd be pissed, but I literally could not stop myself from liking him.
MARY But he's married.
ANNA I realize that.
ANNA I keep trying to force myself to picture him in some church saying vows to some woman, and even that doesn't cool it off.
ANNA What is my problem?
MARY OK.
MARY There was this guy who worked in my dad's printing business.
MARY Married for fifteen years to a nice lady.
MARY And then he meets this woman at some church event.
MARY And he told my dad he just had never felt anything like it before.
MARY I mean, he had finally met the love of his life.
MARY So, he divorced his wife, and he's been with this other woman for 22 years and they are blissfully happy.
MARY I mean, what if you meet the love of your life - but you already married someone else?
MARY Are you supposed to pass them by?
ANNA You're right.
ANNA I'm calling him.
Anna pulls her feet out of the pedicure bath, goes in a private corner, and dials her cell phone.
ANNA (CONT'D) Hey, Ben.
ANNA (CONT'D) This is Anna Marks.
BEN Hey, Anna.
BEN What's up?
ANNA Well, I was just taking you up on your offer.
ANNA You said you might know someone who could help me out and I thought we could discuss it -- over coffee?
Anna waits for a response.
On the other end she hears some rustling, some silence, definitely awkwardness.
BEN Look, I just...I can't Anna.
BEN You seem great.
BEN It's just - I don't know.
BEN I should go.
BEN Take care.
Anna takes this in - STUNNED.
She hangs up.
Her eyes sting.
She can't face Mary so she just stares at weird, bleached out photos of nails and HOLDS BACK THE TEARS.
Finally, she looks at her cell phone and dials again.
Conor opens the door to find Anna standing there.
CONOR I am so psyched that you called.
ANNA Cool.
CONOR I had sort of given up on you when you didn't call me back the other night.
ANNA Well, you know.
ANNA I was just thinking about you.
Conor buys it, and ushers her inside.
Anna is stretched out with a wine glass in hand, feet in Conor's lap.
He rubs her feet as they talk.
ANNA Your turn.
CONOR OK.
CONOR Give me the categories again.
ANNA There are four.
ANNA Sexy, smart, funny or cute.
ANNA And each person can only be two.
ANNA Like Sarah Jessica Parker is funny and sexy.
ANNA Or Bill Clinton is sexy and smart.
CONOR I love that you are hot for Clinton.
ANNA So, which am I?
CONOR What was I again?
ANNA Smart and cute.
Conor smiles, happy for any compliment.
CONOR OK.
CONOR You're sexy.
CONOR Very sexy.
CONOR And cute.
She bangs him on the head with a pillow.
ANNA No.
ANNA Cute and sexy are in the looks column.
ANNA No one wants to be in all one column.
CONOR Well, I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four.
CONOR But you're so obviously all four.
CONOR Especially sexy.
ANNA You're the best.
Anna sits up, and moves to Conor.
She looks at him, pulls him in for a nice, long HUG.
ANNA (CONT'D) I better go.
CONOR Oh.
CONOR OK.
CONOR I mean, you could just stay here tonight.
Anna gives him a knowing look.
CONOR (CONT'D) What?
CONOR (CONT'D) It's been a while.
ANNA I know.
ANNA It's just - I'm fried.
ANNA Is that alright?
CONOR Sure.
CONOR Of course.
Anna smiles and gets up.
Conor reluctantly follows her to the door.
She KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS, smiles, and leaves.
Beth opens the door to find NEIL, standing on the couch in his socks, hanging a PAINTING.
NEIL Hey babe, is this straight?
BETH Why are you hanging that?
NEIL I told you I'd do it weeks ago.
NEIL You don't like it there?
BETH I love it there.
BETH But just - stop.
NEIL It's the image, isn't it?
NEIL I didn't see it before, but - you're right - it totally looks like a sagging boob.
Beth is silent.
NEIL (CONT'D) You want me to take it down?
BETH No.
BETH I want you stop doing anything nice.
NEIL Is this a trick?
BETH No.
BETH I need you to stop being nice to me - unless you're gonna marry me after.
Neil laughs.
BETH (CONT'D) Is that funny?
NEIL No.
NEIL It was just - I was just--
BETH See, you can't keep being nice to me and I can't keep pretending like this is something that it's not.
BETH We've been together over seven years.
BETH You know me.
BETH You either want to marry me or you don't.
NEIL Or there is the possibility that I just don't really believe in the concept of -
BETH BULLSHIT!
BETH BULLSHIT!
BETH Bullshit for every woman who's been told by some guy that he doesn't believe in marriage just to see him turn around eight months later and marry some twenty four year old girl he met at the gym.
BETH Bullshit.
Beth tries to hold back her tears.
Neil looks stunned.
He hops down off the couch and goes to her.
NEIL Honey, where is all this coming from?
BETH From the place that I have been hiding from you for the last five years because I didn't want to seem demanding, or clingy or psycho or whatever.
BETH So I never ask.
BETH But now I'm going to ---
Neil looks at her.
She looks at him.
BETH (CONT'D) Are you ever going to marry me?
Beth looks at Neil.
There is a long, painful SILENCE.
BETH (CONT'D) I can't do this anymore.
She walks out of the room.
AMY sits with a sleeping baby in her arms.
AMY I was with Damon for six years.
AMY He asked me to marry him on the phone, because he's just so different and cool like that.
AMY Said he'd eventually get me a ring, which he didn't, but he did buy himself a ring because isn't that so hilarious and cool that the guy is wearing the ring?
AMY Then, my favorite part is, I stayed with him even after he took back his proposal, and introduced the idea of a "relation vacation."
AMY Isn't that a cute name?
AMY Let me explain the concept: it involves dating a girl from the time she's thirty two to the time she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her of the ability to bear children, and then, after all that, wanting to take a year off.
AMY And giving it a fun name that you can put on t-shirts.
AMY I left him.
Ben, our married guy from the grocery store, sits on the floor in a barely furnished room, and dials his cell.
BEN Hey, Anna.
BEN This is Ben.
BEN Look, I know it's been a little while since you called.
BEN I just - it took me by surprise.
BEN But I offered to help you with your career, and I don't see why I can't do that, right?
BEN So, give me a call.
BEN Maybe you can come by the office this week or something.
BEN Okay, take care.
BEN Bye.
Ben hangs up.
And STARES INTO SPACE until THE DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL: JANINE.
Gigi's co-worker.
And Ben's WIFE.
JANINE Hey, how --
Ben is CLEARLY STARTLED.
BEN Shit - you scared me.
Janine looks at him.
JANINE Is everything OK?
BEN Yeah.
BEN Everything's fine.
BEN Why?
She sits down next to him, looks at him intently.
JANINE Are you smoking again?
BEN No, sweetie.
BEN Why?
JANINE Well - you get jumpy when you smoke.
Ben puts his arm around Janine, and pulls her close.
BEN I'm not smoking.
BEN So, why don't we worry about what color we're gonna paint this room, instead of worrying about things that aren't happening?
Janine contentedly curls up to Ben.
JANINE I don't know - I was thinking maybe - pink?
BEN Pink?
BEN Seriously?
JANINE Well, I mean, at some point.
Janine gives Ben a knowing look.
He gets it.
BEN You sure we're ready for this now?
JANINE No.
JANINE But I mean, we could paint one room pink and one blue just in case.
Ben looks at her and LAUGHS.
BEN You've already created the perfect family in this house, and we don't even have drywall.
JANINE I'm sorry.
JANINE I know I promised we'd wait to talk about it -
Ben looks at her, snuggled against him.
BEN I think we're almost ready to start talking about it.
Janine smiles CONTENTEDLY.
JANINE I've always liked the name Gisele.
Ben LAUGHS.
She lets him.
Packed, Federal Hill happy hour bar scene.
Gigi and Janine stand, squeezed in among the after work crowd.
JARRAD, early thirties, chats amiably with Gigi.
JARRAD Well, ladies, I guess I have to get back to the office.
GIGI You go back to the office after happy hour?
GIGI What's happy about that?
JARRAD I met you.
Janine and Gigi melt.
JARRAD (CONT'D) So, I'd love to call you sometime.
JARRAD (CONT'D) Do you have a card?
GIGI Of course.
Gigi hands him her card with lightning speed.
JARRAD And here's my info.
Jarrad hands Gigi HIS CARD as well.
JARRAD (CONT'D) Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.
He starts to head over to his BUDDIES.
Gigi is confused.
GIGI So, wait -- how are we doing this?
GIGI Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
Jarrad turns back.
JARRAD What?
GIGI You said you'd love to call me, but then you said "look forward to hearing from you."
GIGI See how that's kinda confusing?
JARRAD Look - we'll talk.
JARRAD We'll get in touch.
He tries to take off again.
GIGI Ooopsie - you did it again.
GIGI Very vague.
GIGI You know what?
GIGI Why don't we just say that you'll call me, and then we can skip all the nonsense.
Jarrad just gives her a blank stare.
GIGI (CONT'D) Or I guess I could just call you --
JARRAD Goodbye, Gigi.
He takes off.
The girls watch him.
GIGI He was cute.
JANINE Please don't cyber-stalk him.
Gigi looks at the name on the card - JARRAD MONTROSE - and then - TEARS HIS BUSINESS CARD IN TWO.
JANINE (CONT'D) Wait - what are you doing?
GIGI I'm not calling him.
GIGI If he wants to see me - he'll call.
JANINE Wow, that guy Alex really made an impression on you.
JANINE Was he hot?
GIGI No.
GIGI He was just -- right.
Off Gigi, sipping her drink, full of optimism.
The offices of Baltimore's gay weekly paper.
The elevator opens - and in walks Mary, cheerful as always.
We follow her down the hall as she ad-libs hellos to her co-workers.
One thing becomes glaringly clear - SHE IS
She gets to her desk and is descended upon by - BRUCE, NATHAN, and JOSHUA.
All mid-20's.
All gay.
BRUCE So?
Mary looks at them, smiling, enjoying their impatience.
MARY He asked me out.
NATHAN Oh my god!
NATHAN He called?
MARY Well -
JOSHUA He emailed?
MARY Umm -
BRUCE What?
BRUCE Did he travel by carriage and leave his calling card with your lady in waiting?
MARY He MySpaced me.
The guys all look skeptical.
NATHAN Ouch.
JOSHUA I don't know.
JOSHUA My slutty sister says MySpace is the new booty call.
MARY Well, what am I supposed to do?
MARY Things have changed.
MARY People don't just meet organically anymore.
MARY If I want to make myself more attractive to the opposite sex, I don't go get a new haircut - I update my profile.
MARY That's just how it is.
The guys look at her, starting to understand.
Mary's
MARY (CONT'D) Back to work.
She smiles at the guys - they disperse as she picks up.
MARY (CONT'D) Ad sales - this is Mary.
Conor sits on a bench, NEWSPAPER folded open on his lap.
CONOR Hey, it's Conor.
CONOR Anna's - uh - friend.
CONOR Or whatever.
MARY Hey.
MARY So, did you see it?
CONOR I'm not sure about this.
MARY You gotta trust me.
MARY It's a burgeoning market.
MARY You're gonna make a fortune.
Conor looks at the paper.
CONOR Yeah.
CONOR I hope so.
CONOR But, like - did you have to put me on the page with the massage ads?
MARY It was either that or on the page with the personals.
MARY I made a call.
CONOR OK.
CONOR You're right.
CONOR Hey, have you talked to Anna lately?
Conor leaves the paper and gets up.
He walks away, still on the phone, we STAY WITH THE NEWSPAPER AND WE PUSH IN.
UNDER VARIOUS 1 INCH ADS FOR MASSEUSES, S&M and LEATHER
Under which is a picture of Conor, standing in front of a brick Tudor, a SOLD SIGN proudly displayed.
In the background - TWO MEN look lovingly at their new home.
PAIGE, blonde and angelic, looks on as LAURA, CATHERINE, and Beth pull on matching coral dresses.
CATHERINE I do not understand how you got mom to sew all of these in two weeks.
PAIGE She wanted to do it.
LAURA Mom told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweatshop.
PAIGE No, she didn't.
BETH Why again do you need to get married so fast?
CATHERINE You're so pregnant.
PAIGE I'm not pregnant.
CATHERINE Chug a beer, then.
CATHERINE I want to see you chug a beer.
PAIGE We're in love, you assholes.
PAIGE That's what people do when they're in love - they get married.
Everyone FREEZES.
And looks at BETH.
Big silence.
PAIGE (CONT'D) Bethie, you know I didn't mean --
BETH It's OK.
BETH Neil and I are actually - done - anyway.
This is clearly news.
CATHERINE Why didn't you tell us?
CATHERINE You should have told us.
LAURA You have to come over and have dinner with me and Steven and the kids tonight, OK?
LAURA You can even stay over if you want.
CATHERINE Why would she want to hang out with us and our husbands?
CATHERINE Seriously, Beth, isn't that exactly what you want to avoid right now?
But before Beth can even answer --
PAIGE You know what - if being in the wedding is too painful-
BETH You guys, it's cool.
BETH I'm fine.
BETH So I lost a little time.
BETH Big deal.
Beth grabs her purse and starts for the door.
CATHERINE So not a big deal.
CATHERINE You're still really young.
PAIGE So young.
LAURA Everything you learned in that relationship is just gonna make the next one so much stronger.
BETH Exactly.
Beth exits, still wearing a half-sewn bridesmaid's dress.
LAURA She wasted so much time.
CATHERINE I knew he was never gonna propose.
PAIGE Shit.
The girls nod in agreement.
Ben sits behind his desk, sifting through a pile of papers.
We PAN around to Anna sitting across from him.
BEN I know it's here somewhere.
BEN I spoke to George Lane in music, and he gave me this whole list of references for you.
ANNA It's cool.
ANNA You can call me when you find it.
BEN I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses.
ANNA I know.
ANNA But a girl can dream.
He looks up at her and smiles.
ANNA (CONT'D) You're obviously too good of a guy.
They share a LONG LOOK.
ANNA (CONT'D) Why are you married, again?
Ben LAUGHS.
ANNA (CONT'D) Seriously.
ANNA (CONT'D) Why?
ANNA (CONT'D) It'll be good for me.
ANNA (CONT'D) Tell me how you decided that you could not be without this other woman.
BEN We'd been together since college.
BEN She gave me an ultimatum: we get married or we break up.
BEN So, we got married.
ANNA Seriously?
ANNA You just caved?
BEN It's complicated.
ANNA Really?
BEN You're a dick if you date a girl for too long, and don't marry her.
BEN But you marry her, and then you're an asshole for marrying her before you're ready.
BEN Shit - I don't know.
He looks at her.
BEN (CONT'D) You're really hot and I'm obviously attracted to you, but I guess the best I can do is eventually find this piece of paper, and call you, and hope I help in some small way with your career, and be happy about that.
Anna takes this in.
Janine walks in from work to her construction site home.
She peeks into the dining room, where she sees her CHERRY WOOD DINING TABLE covered in a THICK LAYER OF DUST.
She waits for a response.
Nothing.
She starts to brush the dust off with her hands.
Still nothing.
So Janine drops her work things, and heads out the side door of the house to a STORAGE AREA.
There are cans of paint, bags of cement, some tarps.
Janine grabs a TARP, when she sees, on a window ledge, next to a folding chair - AN ALUMINUM FOIL ASHTRAY.
She stares at them for a moment, then heads back inside.
CLOSE ON: A TORN BUSINESS CARD, TAPED BACK TOGETHER.
The name on the card is JARRAD MONTROSE.
Gigi sits, staring at the card.
She reaches for the phone, and then thinks the better of it.
And again.
Finally, she grabs the receiver, picks it up, and dials.
GIGI Hi, this is Gigi.
Alex sits in his office.
He talks into his CELL.
ALEX Gigi?
GIGI Gigi Phillips.
GIGI I had the - umm - dentist pen.
ALEX Right.
GIGI I'm really sorry to bug you.
GIGI I just - I thought you had some really good insights the other night and -- I had a question.
ALEX Okay, maybe I need to be harsh -- Conor is never going to be interested in you.
GIGI No, I know.
GIGI This is about -
GIGI - Jarrad.
GIGI You have a sec?
ALEX Okay...
GIGI So I meet him at happy hour and he was completely charming --
ALEX Lemme guess - he said the only thing happy about this hour is you.
GIGI He may have used some derivative of that.
GIGI So, he says he's going to call, but then gave me his card and --
ALEX He's not interested.
GIGI You don't even know if he called --
ALEX Did he?
GIGI No.
GIGI But the thing is, I honestly think he's expecting my call.
GIGI (CONT'D) He said "Look forward to hearing from you" and not "Look forward to talking to you."
GIGI (CONT'D) I mean, do you hear the connotations?
ALEX He.
ALEX Is.
ALEX Not.
ALEX Interested.
Tyrone appears in Alex's doorway.
TYRONE Alex - this is jacked.
TYRONE The hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a white shirt -- this shirt is WHITE!
Tyrone points to a VERY SMALL WHITE INSIGNIA on an otherwise BLACK SHIRT.
Alex shuts the door on him.
TYRONE (CONT'D) This shit is white.
ALEX If a guy gives you his phone number, instead of taking yours, he's not interested.
GIGI He took mine first, but then he --
ALEX And, if a guy wants to see you, he will see you.
ALEX I once called 55 Lauren Bell's until I got the right one.
GIGI That's cute.
GIGI What happened?
ALEX As it turned out, her ass looked really huge in daylight.
GIGI Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women?
ALEX Don't call him.
ALEX He doesn't like you.
GIGI Again with the sensitivity.
ALEX Just trying to help.
GIGI I know.
GIGI Thanks.
Gigi hangs up, re-tears up Jarrad's card.
CLOSE ON: HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM written across a CAKE.
As the candles are blown out, we widen to reveal: Anna and Conor siting at a cheap picnic table in a tiny backyard, across from MAYA - Anna's mom.
As Maya refills her glass from a BOTTLE OF WINE, Anna grabs a GIFT from her bag - hands it to her mom.
MAYA Oh sweetie - you didn't have to get me anything.
ANNA Mom - you always say that and I always get you something.
Maya takes a BIG SIP OF WINE (not her first) as she tears open the gift, which is clearly a RECORD ALBUM.
MAYA You didn't.
ANNA It's no big deal.
CONOR What is it?
Maya shows him the album - TIM BUCKLEY'S STARSAILOR.
CONOR (CONT'D) Tim Buckley.
CONOR (CONT'D) Nice.
MAYA Here - put on my favorite.
Anna takes the album and heads through the screen door.
MAYA (CONT'D) Did Anna ever tell you I knew Tim Buckley?
CONOR No.
CONOR She did not.
"Song to the Siren" plays as Anna returns to the table.
MAYA We met at a coffee shop in 1971.
MAYA Hell's Kitchen.
MAYA I had no idea who he was.
MAYA But he had this big mop of hair and these eyes that just looked past you and through you and into you all at the same time.
MAYA Complete interest and disinterest.
MAYA It was amazing.
Maya pulls out a cigarette and lights it.
MAYA (CONT'D) Of course, I was with Anna's father at the time, so, you know...another opportunity missed.
ANNA Mom, please -
MAYA It's the truth.
MAYA I knew them all.
MAYA Robert Plant, Harry Nilsson, Graham Parsons...
MAYA Have you seen the pictures of me from when I was Anna's age?
CONOR Umm - I don't think so -
MAYA Sweetie go get that picture - you know the one -
Anna just looks at her - pleadingly.
MAYA (CONT'D) Go.
MAYA (CONT'D) Your mother's asking you to do something for her on her birthday.
Anna goes inside.
Maya looks to Conor, takes a sip.
MAYA (CONT'D) You'll see - we look strikingly similar.
MAYA (CONT'D) My lips may be a bit fuller, but...
She leans back, puts out her cigarette as Anna returns with A PICTURE.
She hands it to Conor.
INSERT: MAYA, in her early twenties.
Black and white - somewhere in New York.
The resemblance to Anna is scary.
CONOR Wow.
CONOR That's - unbelievable.
MAYA So that's what we're dealing with here, for reference.
MAYA Imagine meeting someone who looks like that in a coffee shop.
Conor looks down at the picture, then back up to Anna.
CONOR That's funny, because, I mean, I guess I kinda did.
CONOR Anna and I met at a restaurant.
CONOR That serves coffee.
CONOR So, not a coffee shop, but...still -
He looks from Maya to Anna.
Maya stands up.
MAYA That's sweet.
MAYA But if we're comparing stories -
MAYA She's no me - and you're no Tim Buckley.
With that, Maya heads inside.
MAYA (CONT'D) Anyone need a refill?
Anna looks to Conor apologetically.
He just smiles.
Anna and Conor walk to the front door of her apartment.
ANNA Thanks again for coming with me.
ANNA You make it so much easier.
CONOR Are you kidding?
CONOR I like your mom.
CONOR She's cool.
ANNA Yeah, well - cool's not always what you're looking for in a mom.
Conor smiles, understanding.
CONOR So, you want another -- foot rub?
He's trying.
But it's awkward.
ANNA Ugh.
ANNA I'm just beat.
ANNA I wanna put on sweats and get in bed.
CONOR I'd be into that.
Anna gives him a smile, opens her front door.
ANNA I'll call you tomorrow, OK?
She gives him a KISS, and goes inside.
TRENT, early 30s, talks to the camera as he drives his Ford Explorer.
He's cute - but trying a smidge too hard - - goatee, leather cord necklace he bought in Cancun, etc.
TRENT If a girl is into you, she's sleeping with you.
TRENT And if after a month - two months at the very outside - she's not sleeping with you, she does not like you.
TRENT I guess the trick is, how to spot this girl early - so you don't waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out that it's never gonna happen.
TRENT So, I've got some signs about how to spot this girl - gleaned from my own experience, of course.
TRENT A girl will never sleep with you if: she calls you cuddly or dependable, she pops a zit in front of you, her name is Amber or Christine, she takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers in dates 1-3.
TRENT I know it's not scientific - but I'm just saying - you were warned.
Alex knocks and opens the door in one motion.
ALEX Hey dude - you here?
CONOR Yep.
Alex heads to the fridge, opens it and looks in.
ALEX Wanna beer?
He pulls TWO BEERS out, shuts the fridge and turns to find Conor standing there.
He's wearing a REALLY TIGHT, SHINY SHIRT and EVEN TIGHTER, VERY BLUE JEANS.
ALEX (CONT'D) Or an apple martini?
CONOR Funny.
Conor grabs the beer and opens it.
ALEX Need I ask?
CONOR It's for work.
CONOR I'm trying to expand my client base.
ALEX By pretending you're gay?
CONOR No.
CONOR By being more gay friendly.
ALEX Or, in real estate terms, by becoming "gay adjacent".
CONOR Nice.
CONOR I may have to use that.
Conor heads back toward his room.
CONOR (CONT'D) I'm gonna try something else.
CONOR (CONT'D) This may be too much.
ALEX I don't know.
ALEX You dress like that - and you're already seeing a girl who won't sleep with you - I think maybe you can pull it off.
CONOR It's not that she won't sleep with me douchebag...I have slept with her.
CONOR It's just, you know, she...um...
ALEX Won't sleep with you anymore.
Conor reappears, now wearing A FRENCH CONNECTION TYPE
CONOR Pretty much, yeah.
CONOR So, what do you think?
Alex gives him the once over.
ALEX I think you're gonna have to beat 'em away with a stick - you hot, sexy man.
Conor rolls his eyes and heads back into his room.
Alex laughs to himself and takes another sip of beer.
Leather couch, framed Orioles jersey - typical bachelor pad.
Gigi is making out with GREGORY, 30s.
GIGI Who would have thought that a random girl from Pilates would fix me up with such a good kisser?
GREGORY Back at you sister.
Gigi beams.
They make out some more.
GIGI I can't wait to kiss you again.
GREGORY Umm.
GREGORY We're kissing right now.
GIGI I know.
GIGI But next time.
GIGI The second date kiss is way more intimate.
As they start kissing again -
GREGORY Well, I'm going out of town tomorrow - so I'll be out of touch for a bit.
Gregory starts pulling off Gigi's top.
Gigi pulls away deftly.
GIGI Would you excuse me a quick second?
GIGI Too many diet cokes...
Gigi makes a beeline down the hall.
Gigi dials her CELL as she goes through Gregory's bathroom cabinets.
Alex is also mid-makeout on his leather couch with a HOT WOMAN.
The PHONE RINGS.
Alex grabs it.
ALEX Yup.
GIGI Hey, sorry to bug you again.
GIGI Quick question.
ALEX Would you excuse me a second, babe?
Alex walks into the hallway.
GIGI I'm making out with a guy - PG stuff - and then he mentions he's going out of town, so he's gonna be out of touch.
ALEX Run.
GIGI But maybe he is going out of town.
ALEX To where?
ALEX The Arab Emirates?
ALEX Where is he going that he has to be out of touch?
Gigi opens the bathroom door and SHOUTS down the hall.
GIGI Where are you going out of town to again?
GREGORY Pittsburgh.
GIGI Pittsburgh.
ALEX Run.
GIGI So, now what?
GIGI I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?
ALEX Uhh - yeah.
GIGI There's not going to be anyone left.
Alex LAUGHS.
ALEX OK, I don't know why I'm saying this - but I actually think I know a nice guy who you might like.
GIGI Yeah?
ALEX Yeah.
ALEX He's a friend of my brother's.
ALEX Bill.
ALEX We'll all meet for a drink - it'll be good.
Gigi smiles.
GIGI So, I'm in his bathroom right now.
GIGI What do I now?
ALEX You gotta come out eventually.
ALEX But I'd really take my time.
ALEX Let him sweat.
He hangs up.
Gigi finds some Crest Whitestrips and - with determination - decides to APPLY THEM.
Anna's rolling up mats, etc.
as a sweaty Ben approaches.
BEN So, we ran into each other.
ANNA You came to my class.
BEN I didn't know it was your class.
ANNA You called and asked me.
BEN But you didn't call me back.
ANNA Because you said not to call back if it was my class.
ANNA Which it was.
Ben recommits.
BEN We ran into each other.
Anna LAUGHS.
ANNA Totally.
ANNA A couple of innocent folks - by happenstance - doing their daily workout near one another.
BEN Exactly.
BEN Thank you.
As Anna picks up her bag and walks past him -
ANNA Wanna swim?
Ben watches her go, not sure she's serious.
Big indoor pool.
Clearly closed, lights off.
Anna opens the door with a KEY, Ben follows.
BEN I was just thinking - why can't we be friends?
BEN Am I not allowed to make friends anymore?
BEN Am I not allowed to be friends with hot people?
BEN What kind of reverse prejudice is that?
ANNA I hear you.
ANNA Am I supposed to not be friends with a guy just because he's married, and happens to have this insane smile and this ass that makes me want to dry hump?
BEN I think I just fell in love.
BEN A girl who talks about a dry hump.
ANNA Classy, right?
BEN Classy is lame.
Anna sits at the edge of the pool.
ANNA So, friends, right?
BEN Totally.
And with that, Anna pulls off her top.
And then her sweats.
And, totally naked, slides into the pool.
ANNA You wanna come in?
BEN I'm sorry.
BEN I don't trust myself.
ANNA OK.
ANNA You can just watch.
He does.
BEN You may be the best friend I've ever had.
Anna LAUGHS, and then dunks her head under the water.
Ben comes in the front door, drops his gym bag.
Janine sits on the couch flipping through a magazine.
He leans in to kiss her on the cheek.
She does not look happy.
JANINE Honey - you smell different.
Ben pulls back smoothly.
BEN Different how?
JANINE I don't know.
BEN Well that's an odd thing to say.
She looks at him.
He tries to coolly meet her gaze.
JANINE Maybe it's the ashtray and cigarettes I found.
JANINE In the side yard.
JANINE What part of "my dad died of lung cancer" is hard for you to wrap your brain around?
BEN What?
JANINE Do not lie to me, Ben.
JANINE Please.
BEN Are you serious?
BEN We have like eight thousand undocumented workers in this house daily.
BEN You find cigarettes, and you automatically assume they're mine?
JANINE Well, yes.
BEN Honey, I'm not lying.
BEN And you are really freaking out.
BEN I think the renovation is getting to you because nothing is going on.
BEN Just please - relax.
Ben walks away.
Off Janine, wanting to believe him.
Ben walks to a boat at the end of the dock.
He stands, unsure, before deciding to KNOCK on the side of the boat.
NEIL emerges - unshaven, possibly unshowered.
NEIL Ah.
NEIL My first visitor.
BEN This boat is sick.
BEN How come you never invited me out before?
NEIL Well, this was supposed to be just for Beth and I - for our retirement.
NEIL Leave our jobs.
NEIL Sell the house.
NEIL Take off.
Neil is clearly having a tough time.
Ben doesn't know what to say.
They're silent for a second.
NEIL (CONT'D) Sorry.
NEIL (CONT'D) Where are my manners?
NEIL (CONT'D) Permission to board granted.
NEIL (CONT'D) I'll show you around.
Ben smiles, steps on to the boat.
CLOSE ON: A cigarette being lit.
WIDEN to reveal Neil smoking on the upper deck of his boat, steering it out into the bay.
Ben stands across from him, looking on.
NEIL Sorry.
BEN It's OK.
Neil switches to his left hand, away from Ben.
NEIL So Janine sent you to check on me?
BEN Yeah.
BEN Pretty much.
NEIL Any message from Beth?
Ben shakes his head no.
Neil seems disappointed.
BEN I think she's been busy getting ready for her sister's funeral though, so...
NEIL Her sister's what?
BEN Wedding.
BEN Her sister's wedding.
BEN What did I say?
Neil is now LAUGHING HARD.
NEIL You said funeral.
BEN No, I didn't.
BEN Shit, did I?
Neil LAUGHS HARDER.
Even Ben sees the humor.
NEIL The marriage thing is weird, man.
NEIL I never thought Beth would give me an ultimatum.
BEN Really?
BEN Why not?
BEN That's what women do.
NEIL Right.
NEIL I forgot.
NEIL That's how Janine got you to bite the bullet.
BEN Yup.
Neil looks at Ben, curious.
NEIL Do you regret it?
BEN No.
NEIL So you're happy?
NEIL You'd say you're happily married?
Ben looks at Neil as if he's crazy.
BEN I love Janine.
Neil takes a drag and looks out over the harbor.
We PAN down one of the long tables to find Beth, SMACKING a crab with a mallet.
HARD.
AND LOUD.
The others at the table turn to look at her, annoyed.
And that's when we see - there seems to be a party and SPEECH underway.
COUSIN Now, I know when my cousin Paige says those vows tomorrow, there are going to be hearts breaking all over the world.
Beth's sister, Paige, smiles.
COUSIN (CONT'D) So, keep in mind, her sister Beth is still on the market.
The cousin WINKS at Beth.
Beth goes white.
COUSIN (CONT'D) Sure, she's an older model, but she's still got a lot of miles left in her.
COUSIN (CONT'D) But don't stay on the lot too long, Bethie, or next year's models will --
KEN MURPHY, 60s, nearly tramples guests to grab the mic.
KEN OK - that's enough of the speeches.
KEN Time to eat.
KEN So enjoy the crab.
KEN And the yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the crab's hepatopancreas.
Mixed reaction from the crowd as Ken puts the mic down.
He starts to return to his table - when he sees Beth trying to make a sneaky exit.
He catches up to her.
KEN (CONT'D) Bethie, your cousin Jay has always been a jackass.
BETH I know.
BETH And even he's married.
KEN So, you'll get married a little bit later than some people.
KEN Big deal.
KEN You never did anything the way every one else did it, and that's what I've always thought was so great about you.
BETH I'm your oldest daughter, and I'm the only one not married.
BETH If this was Fiddler on the Roof you'd have to sacrifice me or something.
Ken laughs and puts his arm around Beth.
KEN Honey, look.
KEN When everyone else was just going to camp at the Y, you borrowed my New York Times, found some arts camp in the Berkshires, wrote away for information, then got accepted on your own.
KEN You were nine.
KEN You never did things the way everyone else did.
BETH Why not?
KEN Because that's you.
KEN That's why you're my favorite daughter.
Beth's eyes go WIDE.
BETH I don't think you're supposed to say that.
KEN Well, I don't give a shit.
KEN I'm retired, and I'll say what I want.
KEN I'll say it into the mic if you want --
BETH That's OK.
KEN It's true, though.
BETH I know.
They HUG.
Gigi sits sipping a drink, alone, when Alex comes in the door and goes directly to her table.
ALEX Sorry I'm late.
GIGI That's OK.
GIGI I like a little time before a blind date - prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars --
ALEX He's not coming.
Alex motions to the WAITRESS to bring them another round.
ALEX (CONT'D) Can't wait to hear that story about the molars, though.
GIGI How can he already not like me?
ALEX I screwed up.
ALEX I told Bill it was Thursday, but I meant Tuesday.
Gigi is disappointed.
The waitress drops off their drinks.
They toast - then observe the SCENE AT THE BAR.
GIGI Awesome.
GIGI I'm stuck here with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday - and meanwhile this girl -
GIGI - she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak.
The GIRL is standing between TWO GUYS.
ALEX Nope.
GIGI How do you know?
ALEX See the guy trying to work the Tom Cruise thing.
ALEX She's interested.
ALEX He's not.
GIGI You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not interested.
ALEX Actually, I can.
ALEX I manage a restaurant.
ALEX I see this stuff go down every night.
ALEX Watch --
As if on cue, Tom Cruise Guy BANGS his elbow into the GIRL, hard, causing her to spill her drink.
Tom Cruise Guy sees, but doesn't acknowledge.
Alex looks smug.
GIGI Man, you have a gift.
ALEX And check out droopy dawg on her other side.
ALEX He can buy her drinks all night, and she'll insist there's no "spark."
GIGI Maybe there isn't.
GIGI You need a spark.
ALEX The "spark" thing is bullshit.
GIGI Really?
GIGI Enlighten me.
ALEX Guys invented the "spark" so they could not call and treat you kind of bad and keep you guessing, and then convince you that the anxiety and fear that it creates in you is actually a "spark."
ALEX And you all buy it.
ALEX You love it.
ALEX You all thrive on it because you all love drama.
GIGI I don't.
ALEX Really?
ALEX So you don't wait until the last minute on deadlines, or on phone bills, because you love the drama of not knowing whether you'll make it?
She's busted.
GIGI Maybe.
ALEX And let me guess - when you were stalking Conor that night - were you obsessing about him calling for days, even though the date was just kind of mediocre?
GIGI OK.
GIGI Yeah.
ALEX See, you thrive on drama.
ALEX You gotta be more like me - if a girl likes me great, if not, there are plenty more like her - probably with smaller pores and bigger implants.
GIGI That's beautiful.
ALEX Thanks.
They continue drinking and observing the scene.
GIGI Why are you sharing all this inside dating information with me again?
ALEX I dunno.
ALEX I like you.
GIGI You do?
ALEX Don't start doodling my name on your binder.
ALEX I just mean, I like you, like I like basset hounds.
ALEX They're kinda pathetic - so you want to cheer them up.
GIGI Again with the sensitivity.
Alex smiles at her.
Gigi can't help but smile back.
Janine walks down the hallway, with JAVIER (40, stocky), her contractor.
She's inspecting the crown molding.
JANINE It looks good.
JAVIER Yes.
JANINE He does good work.
JAVIER He's very good.
Janine stops and looks at Javier.
He looks back at her.
JANINE Javier.
JAVIER Yes.
JANINE Javier, if I asked you an honest question, do you think you could give me an honest answer?
JAVIER I think so.
JANINE Good.
JANINE Because I think some of your guys have been - smoking.
Janine looks at Javier.
It's awkwardly silent.
JANINE (CONT'D) Javier?
JAVIER Is that the question?
JANINE Yes.
JAVIER Oh.
JAVIER It seemed like a statement.
JANINE The question part was implied -
JAVIER I didn't really hear it in the inflection-
JANINE Javier - have your guys been smoking or not?
JAVIER No, ma'am.
JAVIER My guys don't smoke on the job site.
JAVIER They're all good guys.
JANINE Are you sure your guys aren't sneaking around here?
JANINE And smoking?
JANINE And lying to me?
JANINE And -- smoking?
She's starting to freak Javier out.
JAVIER I'm pretty sure.
JANINE I need you to be honest with me, Javier.
JANINE Because I can't have someone lying to me.
JANINE To my face.
JANINE Under my roof.
JANINE On my time.
JAVIER That's a lot of prepositions...
Janine does not hear him, and barrels on -
JANINE I mean, there is no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there?
JANINE IS THERE?
JANINE I mean, we made promises to one another --
Javier looks at her - what the hell is she talking about?
JANINE (CONT'D) What I mean is, we had a contract.
JANINE (CONT'D) Which is like making promises to each other, right?
JAVIER Maybe I should just get back to work.
JANINE Yes.
JANINE Fine.
JANINE Good idea.
Javier starts to leave.
JANINE (CONT'D) But, we're good here, right?
JANINE (CONT'D) Me and you?
Blank stare from Javier.
Janine slaps on a smile.
JANINE (CONT'D) Okay, great.
JANINE (CONT'D) The molding really does look great.
Javier gives a forced smile, and heads back to work.
TWO WELL BUILT MEN (SKIP and LARRY) sip from bottles of Volvic water as they wander through a kitchen, inspecting the cabinetry.
Conor comes into to frame, wearing a toned down version of his "gay friendly" clothes.
CONOR Hello, my name is Conor.
CONOR Please sign in whenever you get a chance.
He gestures to a guest book on the kitchen island - next to which Anna stands.
Conor joins her.
ANNA This is insane.
ANNA You're like the Liza Minelli of real estate.
CONOR I know.
CONOR Your friend Mary's a genius.
The house is TEEMING WITH GAY COUPLES - opening closets, admiring floors, munching on complimentary cookies.
ANNA Alright.
ANNA Gotta run.
CONOR You got a class?
ANNA Uh, no.
ANNA Just some stuff.
ANNA See you later?
CONOR Sure.
Conor goes in for a HUG, but Anna's not ready for it - so he just ends up grabbing her.
It's awkward.
She leaves, Conor tries to play it off, looks around the room.
Skip and Larry look at him sympathetically.
CONOR (CONT'D) What?
SKIP She's holding out on you, isn't she?
CONOR I'm not sure I get your meaning.
LARRY It's obvious.
LARRY She won't sleep with you.
LARRY It's written all over your puppy dog face.
Conor looks at them, decides not to fight it.
CONOR It's killing me.
CONOR Literally.
CONOR I'm dying.
Skip and Larry move closer, Larry grabs a plate.
LARRY Here, have a cookie.
CONOR I just - I have no idea what she's doing.
CONOR I cannot read her signals - at all.
CONOR We used to sleep together - all the time.
CONOR Well, that's not true, I don't know why I said that, it wasn't all the time.
CONOR But it did happen - I know I'm not making this up.
CONOR And then, out of nowhere, it stops.
CONOR But she still calls, she stops by, she sleeps on my couch, she wants a massage, she leaves cute messages - but it never goes ANYWHERE.
CONOR I mean, what is she doing?
LARRY Honestly - we may not have the best insight.
LARRY Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals.
SKIP He's right.
SKIP Like - here's "I want to sleep with you".
He looks at Larry.
Larry looks back at him.
They don't break their gaze.
LARRY One, two, three - that's it.
LARRY Three seconds or more - it's on.
SKIP Here's "I don't want to sleep with you."
Skip look at Larry again.
Larry meets his gaze.
LARRY One, two -
LARRY No.
LARRY Thanks for playing.
LARRY Move along.
SKIP It's that simple.
CONOR You're right.
CONOR That's no help at all.
LARRY But listen - I can tell you this.
LARRY Gay or straight, you're not going to get anywhere by being inactive.
LARRY She clearly likes you - maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something.
LARRY So the next time you're in the position - don't take no for an answer.
Skip looks at Larry, concerned.
SKIP That sounds like felonious advice.
LARRY You're right.
LARRY Let me rephrase.
LARRY Don't take maybe for an answer.
Conor takes this in - that's not a bad idea.
Cute studio apartment.
And Ben is in the bed.
Anna walks in from the bathroom, in a robe.
Ben watches her.
BEN Wait.
BEN Stop.
ANNA What?
BEN Shit.
BEN This is bad.
ANNA What?
BEN I am so into you.
Anna BEAMS.
She joins him in bed.
BEN (CONT'D) I'm lying here watching you and I seriously have never felt this way before.
BEN (CONT'D) I have to forcibly make my brain stop thinking about you.
BEN (CONT'D) I mean, all the time.
ANNA Why stop?
She looks at Ben.
He's not smiling.
BEN Because I don't do stuff like this.
ANNA Stuff like what?
BEN Like having sex with women who are not my wife.
ANNA First of all, I'm not women.
ANNA I'm just one.
He waits.
BEN What's second of all?
ANNA I didn't have a second of all.
BEN I thought second of all was going to make me feel better.
Anna thinks.
ANNA Second of all - I can't stop thinking about you, either.
They look at each other for a LONG MOMENT.
BEN I have to tell her.
ANNA What?
BEN I have to tell her.
Anna's eyes light up, but she tries to cover.
ANNA I don't want to push you to --
BEN I want to be with you.
BEN And I can't do that if I'm lying to her.
ANNA You know what's best.
As Ben pulls her to him, she lets a smile take hold.
LOUIS, 60's, with a kind but very wise face, talks to the camera in his FORMAL DOORMAN attire, standing in front of a posh Upper East Side building.
LOUIS Here's the thing - my daughter is happily married with kids and running a tanning salon on Staten Island.
LOUIS But if she wasn't, I'd tell her the same thing I'd like to tell a lot of the girls that come in and out of this building on the arm of a married guy.
LOUIS (CONT'D) And here is that advice --- get stocks, cash, annuities, a deed in your name.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Don't settle for flowers and a shopping spree at Bendel's.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Think to the future.
LOUIS (CONT'D) We all know that none of these guys is gonna leave his society wife and let her keep half the money and the classic eight on Park Avenue.
LOUIS (CONT'D) So, I wanna tell these young ladies, as long as you only have the guy for a finite period of time -- get something that can last.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Because I guarantee you - he won't.
LOUIS (CONT'D) And that's the best fatherly advice I can give.
Mary and Anna, in sweats and Ugg boots and dirty hair, both load their carts with cheap beauty products.
ANNA I'm not picking out china patterns or anything - but I've never felt anything like this before.
MARY This is crazy.
MARY I can't believe he's gonna leave his wife for you.
ANNA No, he's not leaving his wife for me.
ANNA He's just - he's a good guy.
ANNA And he can't really explore what we could be if he's lying to her.
Mary looks at her.
ANNA (CONT'D) He's kind of leaving his wife for me.
ANNA (CONT'D) Is this crazy?
ANNA (CONT'D) This is totally crazy.
ANNA (CONT'D) We barely know each other.
MARY I don't know.
MARY Remember Becca, my sister's friend.
MARY Some guy waits on her at Bennigan's - by the end of the night they both knew they had found the one.
ANNA You're totally right.
ANNA It can happen.
MARY Not for me.
ANNA Well, what about texter?
MARY Texter has yet to make any verbal contact.
MARY I mean, this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice box, breathing through a stoma, and I'd never know because I never actually hear his voice.
ANNA I doubt he has a stoma -
MARY That's not the point.
MARY The point is - I can't text.
MARY I'm not charming via text.
MARY My sarcasm doesn't come through, I can't type fast enough on the little phone keyboard --
ANNA So don't text.
MARY It's not just texting.
MARY It's email and voicemail and snail mail -
ANNA That's just mail -
MARY Whatever.
MARY None of it's working.
MARY I've had a guy leave a voicemail for me at work, and then I call him back at home, and he emails me to my Blackberry, and then I text him to his cell and then he emails me to my home account from the plane phone -- and it just totally gets out of hand.
MARY I miss the days where you had one phone number with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the cassette tape had a message from the guy or it didn't.
MARY That's it.
MARY Now you have to go around checking all your portals and get rejected by seven different technologies.
MARY It's exhausting.
Anna, who is trying a different shade of nail polish on each finger, calmly looks up at Mary.
ANNA So what about the singer guy?
MARY Jude.
MARY Yeah, I like him.
ANNA That's great.
MARY Totally.
MARY I felt like we connected.
Gigi sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, eating graham crackers and watching SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL on TV.
The phone RINGS.
GIGI Hello.
Even in the office we can hear the din of the bar scene.
ALEX Oh, hey.
ALEX You're home.
GIGI Where am I supposed to be?
ALEX Out.
ALEX It's Saturday night.
GIGI You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me.
GIGI It's kind of limiting.
ALEX I was just calling to let you know - I'm having a party at my place next weekend.
ALEX You should come.
Gigi considers this.
GIGI I don't know.
GIGI Won't Conor be there?
GIGI Might be kinda awkward.
ALEX He's in DC for the weekend at some real estate conference.
ALEX But there's gonna be a bunch of single guys.
GIGI So I will have plenty of chances to be awkward.
GIGI Thank god.
ALEX Don't worry.
ALEX I'll be there.
ALEX I'll talk you through it.
Gigi smiles.
GIGI So, the party - is it like a big party, more of a mellow hang or --
A CRASH outside Alex's office.
ALEX Yeah, OK.
ALEX Gotta go - I think someone just dropped 84 wine glasses.
Gigi hangs up, and goes back to watching her movie.
CLOSE ON: The TV screen as Mary Stuart Masterson (as WATTS) and Eric Stoltz (as KEITH) hang out in a garage.
WATTS Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer who'll be swept off her feet at the touch of your amateur lips.
KEITH I think I can handle it.
WATTS It's cool.
WATTS I was just gonna work on it with you but - if you're comfortable...great.
KEITH Wait.
KEITH How do you work on it?
WATTS Pretend I'm a girl, OK?
WATTS I mean, pretend I'm her...Amanda.
Gigi sits up.
A light bulb has gone off.
As she watches Keith and Watts kiss on screen, a smile crosses her face.
Gigi blows in, dumps her things and turns to Janine:
GIGI He's into me.
JANINE Awesome.
JANINE I knew it.
JANINE Who's this now?
GIGI Alex.
GIGI It's totally clear to me now.
GIGI He's Watts.
JANINE What?
GIGI From Some Kind of Wonderful.
JANINE Wait, isn't Mary Stuart Masterson Watts?
GIGI Yes.
JANINE So, why aren't you Watts?
GIGI I'm Eric Stoltz.
JANINE What?
GIGI Alex is Watts because Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones, but really she's in love with Eric Stoltz herself.
JANINE Wait - so who's Amanda Jones?
GIGI I guess Conor at first.
GIGI Now men in general.
GIGI But that's not the point.
GIGI The point is -- he's into me.
JANINE You know, I knew there had to be a reason he was spending all that time with you.
GIGI I know!
GIGI It's so obvious now -- there are so many signs.
JANINE Oooh, gimme the signs.
JANINE I love to hear about the signs.
Janine rolls her chair closer to Gigi's desk.
GIGI At first they were small - like when I first called he said "Good to hear from you" -
JANINE Totally good sign.
GIGI Right?
GIGI And then the next time I called he was with a woman - but he still took the call.
GIGI And talked to me for a while.
JANINE You know it was a woman?
GIGI He called her "babe."
JANINE A guy does not leave a woman - to talk to another woman - unless there's something going on.
GIGI I know!
GIGI And it gets more obvious.
GIGI I mean, please - there was no guy he was going to fix me up with.
GIGI The fix up was him.
JANINE Wait - really?
GIGI He shows up - without this fictitious Bill character - and the two of us basically have a date.
GIGI And then he calls me to invite me to a party at his place.
JANINE You're right.
JANINE He so likes you.
Janine rolls her chair up to Gigi's computer screen.
JANINE (CONT'D) Let's look up places for your destination wedding.
JANINE (CONT'D) Would you guys wanna do Napa Valley - I've always wanted to go there.
Gigi laughs but doesn't fight as Janine starts searching.
Mary sits at her desk, surrounded by her gays.
They are all looking at her computer screen.
MARY There's no way he's already called - we only met for coffee last night.
MARY I mean we video iChatted.
MARY While holding coffee.
MARY Kinda like having coffee.
Nathan hands her the phone.
NATHAN Just call your voice mail.
MARY And he told me he had a gig last night, so he probably got in real late.
MARY Did I tell you he was singer?
BRUCE Just call.
Mary cradles the receiver with her shoulder and dials.
JOSHUA On speaker.
Mary hits the SPEAKERPHONE button.
YOUR SOUL-UTION Maaaary.
YOUR SOUL-UTION Mary, Mary, Mary, Maaaary.
YOUR SOUL-UTION Oh my Maaary.
Mary is clearly charmed.
The gays all SWOON.
NATHAN I just got hard.
The other guys shush him.
YOUR SOUL-UTION Hey Mary, it's Jude.
YOUR SOUL-UTION Just wanted to tell you again how special it was to meet you.
YOUR SOUL-UTION So, call me back.
YOUR SOUL-UTION Bye.
BEEP.
Mary BEAMS.
BRUCE Amazing.
BRUCE He'll sing to your babies.
Mary basks in the attention.
Then, ANOTHER BEEP.
YOUR SOUL-UTION Jeeeeny.
YOUR SOUL-UTION Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jeeeeny.
All heads whip around at stare at the SPEAKER PHONE.
YOUR SOUL-UTION (CONT'D) Hey Jenny, it's Jude.
YOUR SOUL-UTION (CONT'D) Just wanted to -- oh shit, - what number did I call?
SOME RUSTLING NOISES, and a HANG UP, followed by a dial tone.
Mary stares at the phone - then pushes a BUTTON.
They all head wordlessly back to work.
CLOSE ON: TWO SEEMINGLY IDENTICAL PLANKS OF WOOD.
We pull back to reveal Ben and Janine, in the wide aisle of Home Depot, as Janine really studies the two pieces of wood.
Finally, she POINTS to one of them.
JANINE That one.
BEN No.
BEN That's the laminate.
JANINE That one isn't real hardwood floor?
BEN No.
BEN But it looks exactly the same - at like one one hundredth of the cost.
Janine considers this.
JANINE I still wanna go with the real wood.
BEN But you can't even tell the difference.
JANINE That's not the point.
BEN Then what's the point?
JANINE I just don't like the way it's pretending to be wood.
JANINE If you're not wood, then don't try to look like wood.
BEN I don't think it's pretending --
Ben is making light.
But Janine is all business.
JANINE It's a lie.
JANINE Just be up front - tell people what you really are.
Ben takes this in.
His cheeks start to burn.
BEN You're right.
BEN I'm sorry.
BEN You're totally right.
JANINE It's OK.
JANINE Maybe we should look at the grills and come back.
As she starts to steer their giant cart away, Ben just stands there, fused to the ground.
Finally:
BEN I slept with someone.
Janine stops, doesn't say anything.
JANINE I heard you.
She doesn't turn to face him.
Total silence.
JANINE (CONT'D) You tell me this in Home Depot because you know how I hate a public scene.
BEN That is not why I -
JANINE I knew it.
JANINE I KNEW IT.
JANINE You asshole.
BEN I'm sorry.
BEN I'm so sorry.
JANINE And it's you that's been smoking, too, isn't it?
BEN What?
BEN Why does that matter?
Janine turns to Ben.
She is IRATE.
BEN No.
BEN No.
BEN I haven't.
Janine just STARES AT HIM, FUMING.
BEN (CONT'D) Look, I talked to Neil, and he said I could stay on his boat for a while if --
Now Janine's eyes go wide with disbelief.
JANINE EXCUSE ME?
JANINE And now you want to move out?
JANINE You're like - what - leaving me?
Ben looks confused, but is trying to roll with it.
BEN No.
BEN NO.
BEN I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to --
JANINE We're not going to deal with this?
JANINE We're not going to figure out a way to work through this?
BEN I just assumed that once I told you, you would want me -- out.
JANINE Is that what you want?
BEN No.
She heads down the aisle with the cart.
Ben follows, confused - that didn't go how he thought it would.
The lush grounds surrounding a beautiful turn-of-the- century mansion.
The procession of a wedding has just begun.
TWO ADORABLE FLOWER GIRLS start things off.
Then Beth's sister, Laura, processes down the aisle with her husband, STEVEN.
Beth's sister Catherine and her husband GEORGE are next.
Big smiles all around.
Then Beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort - BUDDY, a 12 year old CHOCOLATE LAB, wearing a coral bow tie.
Beth forces a smile as she processes with Buddy - who stops to piss on a chair leg.
Beth is not happy.
A lavish reception.
Beth takes her seat next to DAN, 40s.
Dan looks over at Beth's place card.
DAN You must be Beth.
BETH Yep.
DAN I've heard a lot about you from Paige.
DAN I'd been lobbying for weeks to be seated next to her single sister.
BETH Oh, yeah?
BETH So you are -
BETH Dan.
DAN Uh, sort of.
BETH Hmmm?
DAN Well, I'm actually a wiccan.
DAN So I have a magickal name.
BETH Really?
DAN It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.
DAN But I didn't know if that would fit on a card.
Beth slaps on a fake smile, and grabs for the wine.
A PARTY is in full swing.
Typical affair for someone in their late 20's - mediocre food but decent alcohol.
Gigi stands, somewhat uncomfortably, near the Chex Mix.
She tries smiling at a TALL GIRL, who ignores her.
So Gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls of Chex Mix into her mouth.
NATHAN It makes your breath stink.
GIGI Pardon?
Gigi looks up to see Nathan and Bruce - Mary's gay coworkers who are now decked out in full-on Saturday night gay mode - standing next to her.
NATHAN Chex Mix.
NATHAN I learned the hard way.
NATHAN I made out with a guy after eating like a bag of the stuff.
NATHAN He said my breath smelled like trout.
Gigi puts her handful of Chex Mix back.
GIGI Thanks for the tip.
NATHAN I'm sorry.
NATHAN That was rude.
NATHAN And that guy I made out with was a total asshole.
BRUCE You want me to smell you?
BRUCE I'm sure you don't smell like trout.
Gigi LAUGHS.
GIGI Thanks.
GIGI I'm good.
She cups her hand and surreptitiously checks her breath.
NATHAN I'm Nathan.
NATHAN This is Bruce.
GIGI Gigi.
GIGI How do you guys know Alex?
BRUCE We don't.
BRUCE Our friend Mary heard about it from some guy named Conor.
Gigi smiles in recognition.
NATHAN How do you know Alex?
GIGI I hope - I mean I'm pretty sure - something is about to happen between us.
NATHAN So, you're here as like a guest, or like his date?
BRUCE I hate that - when you don't know if you're a date - so you don't know if you should bring a friend, or if you're like co-hosting or if you should stay til the end to have alone time --
Suddenly, a look of DOUBT sweeps across Gigi's face.
GIGI He didn't really say.
She reflexively GRABS FOR THE CHEX MIX and starts gorging on it again.
Nathan stops her.
GIGI (CONT'D) But I'm sure I'm more than just a guest.
GIGI (CONT'D) I mean - there have been signs.
NATHAN Cool.
BRUCE I did get a slight waft of trout, though.
BRUCE Take a mint.
He reaches in his pocket.
Gigi looks at him gratefully.
GIGI Thank you.
Dinner is over.
The dance floor is crowded.
The bride, Paige, is out there.
Beth's dad is dancing with her mom.
Beth's dad gives Beth a wink as she heads onto to the dance floor with DOMINIC, 50s and fat.
DOMINIC So, where's Neil?
BETH We actually broke up.
DOMINIC No way.
DOMINIC You guys were together for like ten years.
BETH Seven.
BETH But yes, a long time.
They continue to dance.
DOMINIC Too bad cousins can't marry, huh?
DOMINIC Cuz then we could maybe --
BETH Eeew Dominic, gross.
Beth swats Dominic on the arm, and he laughs.
And then they are distracted by a COMMOTION ON THE DANCE FLOOR.
Everyone has stopped dancing.
They are looking to the floor, near the band.
Beth pushes her way through to see-
The place is packed.
Gigi is smashed into a hallway, trying to look relaxed.
Alex comes up behind her.
ALEX I had no idea it would be such a madhouse.
Gigi turns to him and smiles.
GIGI Hey.
GIGI Great party.
ALEX Are any guys hitting on you?
ALEX Do you need me to evaluate their level of interest?
GIGI They were gay.
GIGI Even I know that their level of interest was probably low.
ALEX Well - too bad Bill couldn't make it.
ALEX I still think you guys would hit it off.
Gigi smiles knowingly - on to Alex's scam.
GIGI Oh OK.
GIGI Right.
GIGI "Bill".
Alex doesn't know how to take that.
ALEX Anyway - I'm on my way to put out some more liquor.
ALEX But it looks like the food could use some refreshing --
He looks at the FOOD TABLE.
Everything is empty.
ALEX (CONT'D) Would you mind helping?
ALEX (CONT'D) I mean, just refill the chips and stuff?
GIGI You mean, kind of like --- co-hosting?
Gigi LOOKS ELATED.
Alex looks CONFUSED.
ALEX Uhh, OK.
ALEX The chips are on top of the fridge.
He walks away.
Gigi smiles BIG.
The party is now even more crowded.
Gigi weaves her way through the crowd.
She's deftly holding SIX DRINKS, passing them off to various people as she walks.
She stops at the food table, rearranges a few bowls.
She CATCHES ALEX'S EYE across the room, he's talking to friends.
She smiles and gives a THUMBS UP.
He gives an awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation.
Gigi is in the kitchen, mixing up some DIP.
She chats with a couple of PARTY-GOERS, very much at home.
PARTY-GOER #1 Really great party.
GIGI Thanks.
GIGI When Alex said he wanted to have a party, I was like "Let's do it."
PARTY-GOER #2 Thanks so much for having us.
GIGI No problem.
GIGI Anytime.
An attractive TALL GIRL enters the kitchen, and starts LOOKING IN THE CUPBOARDS.
Gigi watches with interest.
GIGI (CONT'D) Can I help you find something?
The Tall Girl finds a BOWL in the cabinet, and grabs it.
TALL GIRL No, that's OK.
TALL GIRL I got it.
She brings the bowl over to the counter, and starts emptying Gigi's dip into the bowl.
Gigi is THROWN.
TALL GIRL (CONT'D) Thanks for mixing that up.
GIGI What?
TALL GIRL Alex asked me to get the dip together.
TALL GIRL Thanks for getting it started.
Gigi's face grows red.
The Tall Girl tastes the dip.
TALL GIRL (CONT'D) Hmmm - could use a little more dill.
Then the Tall Girl deftly grabs the dip, and chips, and heads back out to the party.
Gigi looks to the confused party-goers, not pleased.
Bruce and Nathan wave to Gigi as they leave.
People are getting coats - the crowd is definitely thinning.
Gigi spots Alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline.
GIGI When someone's underwear ends up in your toaster oven - it's been a good party.
Alex looks at the toaster oven and laughs.
ALEX I guess people had fun.
Then, the TALL GIRL emerges.
TALL GIRL Alex, you want me to start cleaning up?
Gigi STARES DAGGERS AT HER.
GIGI That's sweet of you.
GIGI But I thought I'd stick around, so I'll take care of it.
TALL GIRL No.
TALL GIRL I got it.
The tall girl shoots Gigi a dirty look as she grabs a trash bag.
Gigi grabs one, too.
Alex looks mystified.
ALEX Knock yourselves out.
It is really late.
Everyone's gone - except the TALL GIRL and ALEX, who sit on the couch playing a NBA LIVE on the XBOX.
Gigi enters from the kitchen.
GIGI I think I've rounded up the last of the beer bottles.
The tall girl and Alex do not look up from the game.
Gigi stands there awkwardly.
GIGI (CONT'D) So, umm - what game is this?
They ignore her.
She looks around.
It's awkward.
GIGI (CONT'D) Well, maybe I should just -- you know -- I mean it's past three and --
TALL GIRL YES!!
TALL GIRL Suck it!
Alex tosses down his controller.
ALEX You are sensational.
The tall girl beams.
Gigi flinches.
TALL GIRL Did you say it's past three?
TALL GIRL Man, I gotta go.
Gigi suppresses a SMILE.
The Tall Girl gives Alex a hug, and heads out.
Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next to him on the couch.
They're silent for a moment.
ALEX Thanks for staying and helping clean up - but I really gotta get to bed.
GIGI Is that an invitation?
ALEX What?
GIGI I'm sorry.
GIGI That was cheesy.
GIGI I'm not good at this.
But then -- before Alex knows what's happening, Gigi is LUNGING at him.
She puts his face in her hands, and starts to KISS HIM.
REALLY KISS HIM.
Finally, Gigi pulls away.
She looks breathless.
GIGI (CONT'D) Yes!
Alex looks a little afraid.
GIGI (CONT'D) I knew it.
GIGI (CONT'D) I knew it.
GIGI (CONT'D) The best relationships grow out of friendships.
She goes in to kiss him again.
This time he stops her.
ALEX Wait - what?
GIGI Ummmm....
ALEX Now you and I are in a relationship?
GIGI Well, I'd say if we're not at relationship station--ship, we're at least on the track.
Alex gets up off the couch.
ALEX And why would you think that, exactly?
GIGI Because there were - you know - signs.
ALEX Really?
ALEX Like what?
GIGI Ummm - it was good to hear from me.
GIGI You talked to me even when you were with a girl.
GIGI I felt something...
She trails off.
Alex is not pleased.
ALEX What are you talking about?
ALEX What have I been saying since I met you?
ALEX If a guy wants to date you HE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN.
GIGI No.
ALEX Why would you do this?
GIGI I thought you were Watts.
Alex doesn't even hear her.
ALEX Why do women do this?
ALEX Why do they build this stuff up in their minds, take each little thing a guy does and twist it into something else --
Gigi stands there, embarrassed, taking Alex's berating.
GIGI I'd rather be like that - than like you.
ALEX Excuse me?
GIGI Maybe I dissect each little thing, and put myself out there too much, and maybe I even thrive on the drama of it all-- but at least that means I still care.
GIGI You think you've won because women are expendable to you?
GIGI Sure, you don't get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way, but you don't fall in love that way, either.
GIGI You haven't won, Alex.
GIGI You're alone.
Gigi grabs her bag.
GIGI (CONT'D) I may do a lot of stupid shit - but I know I'm a lot closer to finding someone than you are.
Gigi turns and heads out the door.
Gigi looks at the phone, and then finally DIALS.
GIGI Hey Janine, I'm sorry it's so late, but I just - don't start picking out your bridesmaid dress, OK?
GIGI I know this isn't the first time this has happened, it's just - this one wasn't about whether he liked me.
GIGI I just really liked him.
Gigi hangs up, lays on the bed, snaps off the light.
Ken Murphy, Beth's dad, lies in bed, in a Notre Dame sweatshirt, with papers, and books surrounding him.
Beth clears his breakfast dishes off of the bed.
BETH You want anything else?
KEN Yeah.
KEN Less of that cardboardy brown stuff.
KEN More regular people food.
BETH The cardboardy brown stuff is called whole grain bread.
KEN Maybe you could just fry me up a couple sausage links?
BETH People who have just had heart attacks generally are not advised to eat animal fat, stuffed in synthetic casings.
Ken looks at her, with a wry smile.
KEN Did I tell you that you're not only my favorite daughter, but you're also the prettiest?
KEN So much better looking than those other dogs.
KEN Seriously.
BETH It's not gonna work this time.
BETH But I appreciate the effort.
Beth takes his dirty dishes and heads for the door.
Beth hauls the dishes downstairs and through the den where Steven, Laura's husband, is on the couch, intently watching the golf channel.
STEVEN Hey, Beth.
STEVEN Grab me a beer if you're going that way?
Beth rolls her eyes.
STEVEN (CONT'D) And a little plate of cold cuts if there are any left?
Beth just keeps on walking.
Beth walks by Paige, on the couch, and DEVON, Paige's new husband, on the floor, surrounded by a mess of VINYL RECORDS.
He has an old BOBBY DARIN tune BLARING.
BETH You might wanna kill the volume just a smidge.
BETH My mom is finally taking a nap.
DEVON You think your dad really wants to hang on to all this vinyl?
DEVON My collection could use a bunch of these.
BETH Turn it the fuck down.
Both Devon and Paige look at her, stunned.
The kitchen is a total MESS.
Beth sets the dishes down in a precarious pile of other dishes, and sees her sisters Laura and Catherine at the kitchen table.
BETH I finally got mom to lay down in the spare room.
BETH All we have left to eat is some old jelly and ramen noodles, so after I tackle some of these dishes, maybe we can go to the store.
BETH Our new brother is trying to co-opt dad's property before he's even dead.
BETH (CONT'D) And Laura, your husband would really like a beer to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf channel.
Beth looks up.
Laura is pointing to Catherine, who has her head in her hands.
She's CRYING SOFTLY.
BETH (CONT'D) It's OK.
BETH (CONT'D) It's all gonna be OK.
CATHERINE What am I gonna do without dad?
BETH First of all, he's upstairs watching 'Oprah After The Show'.
LAURA And second of all - you have us.
CATHERINE But he's always been - the one who's there for me.
BETH What about your husband?
BETH Where the hell is he?
CATHERINE Playing ultimate frisbee.
CATHERINE His team may make the quarterfinals.
Beth rolls her eyes.
The DISHES crash in the sink.
Janine sits at Beth's desk, across from Gigi, who stares at her in disbelief.
Janine fiddles with a TILE SAMPLE.
GIGI Do you know who it is?
JANINE It doesn't matter.
GIGI So are you going to - leave - him?
JANINE Gigi, he's my husband.
JANINE He's not just some guy that didn't call me back.
JANINE And he did admit it to me.
JANINE He didn't wait to get caught.
JANINE That takes courage.
Gigi is clearly STUNG.
JANINE (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
JANINE (CONT'D) I didn't mean that.
JANINE (CONT'D) I know Alex was not just some guy.
GIGI It's OK.
JANINE It's my fault, you know.
GIGI What?
JANINE I'm willing to accept my responsibility in this.
JANINE I forced him into getting married.
JANINE He wasn't ready.
GIGI Janine - this is not your fault.
JANINE It is.
JANINE I've - changed.
JANINE I used to be fun.
JANINE I was fun when we met.
GIGI You're still fun.
A BEAT.
Janine looks at Gigi, the tears come.
JANINE We never have sex anymore.
GIGI Lots of couples got through lulls.
JANINE No.
JANINE We never have sex.
JANINE Realistically, what did I expect him to do?
GIGI I don't think that's really --
She looks down at the TILE in her hand.
JANINE This is too small.
JANINE I gotta tell Javier.
GIGI What?
JANINE This tile.
JANINE I gotta go.
JANINE Tell Beth I took a personal day.
Janine grabs her purse, heads out as Gigi looks on.
MARIEL (50's, highly manicured, upper class type) sits on a yacht in what looks to be the French Riviera.
MARIEL My first husband was unimpressive.
MARIEL I found him in bed with his big breasted secretary when I came home early from the Maldives.
MARIEL So unoriginal, it made me feel sorry for him.
MARIEL My second husband was a pinch more creative.
MARIEL Cheated on me with my sister - but made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious.
MARIEL At last - some intrigue, some mind games - though my sister's two year old eventually gave them up.
MARIEL But my last husband -- he was a gem.
MARIEL A veritable master at covering his tracks.
MARIEL I poured over his phone records, intercepted his credit card bills, had him followed on countless occasions - and never found a single shred of evidence.
MARIEL It wasn't until he died that I found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress.
MARIEL But the real master, I have to say -- is me.
MARIEL Three husbands -- countless boyfriends, and I haven't been caught yet.
Anna SQUEEZES Ben's hand as they stride down the hallway to his office.
Anna is trying to suppress a smile.
ANNA Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god...
Ben smoothly EXTRICATES his hand from Anna's.
He nods to COWORKERS as they pass.
BEN It was all you, babe.
ANNA Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Ben smiles at Anna, as they round the corner of the corridor to his office.
He goes in, and she follows.
Ben deftly shuts and locks the door behind them.
BEN This is really good news.
ANNA I cannot believe this.
ANNA He liked my demo.
ANNA Did you hear what he said?
ANNA When he said it was hauntingly beautiful?
ANNA Did you hear that part?
BEN Yep.
BEN I was sitting right there.
Ben smiles, and pulls Anna to him.
ANNA Thank you.
ANNA Thank you so much.
With that, they start to KISS.
It gets heated.
CLOTHES START TO COME OFF.
MOSTLY ANNA'S.
They make their way over to the LEATHER SOFA.
BEN How is it that every time I see your body, I'm shocked at how beautiful it is?
Anna smiles at the compliment.
She starts to work on his shirt when: SOMEONE TRIES TO OPEN THE LOCKED DOOR.
BEN (CONT'D) Dana, I need to go over the offering statement.
BEN (CONT'D) Can I get a few minutes?
Ben continues to remove his shirt as he talks.
JANINE It's not Dana.
BEN FREEZES.
Literally freezes on top of Anna.
ANNA Is -
Ben FRANTICALLY puts his hands over Anna's mouth.
Then, working with speed and precision, he GATHERS ALL OF ANNA'S THINGS and shoves her - NAKED - into the CLOSET.
There isn't enough room to stand, so she has to sit.
She looks up at Ben, he closes the closet door.
He goes to the door of the office.
BEN Shit.
BEN I told Dana to get this lock fixed.
BEN One sec.
JANINE Why do you even lock it?
Ben re-buttons his shirt, gives the office a once over.
BEN I'd never get anything done if I didn't.
Finally, Ben opens the door, and Janine is standing there, smiling.
JANINE Can I come in?
BEN Of course.
She makes a show of CLOSING AND LOCKING THE DOOR.
BEN (CONT'D) What are you doing?
JANINE Sit down.
Ben goes to sit behind his desk, confused.
Janine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle Ben at his desk chair.
Her skirt is way too long to do this, so she has to regroup, and hike up the skirt.
Ben glances over at the closet.
BEN (CONT'D) Janine, what are you doing?
JANINE I don't know.
JANINE I just thought - maybe we could, you know, relight the fire.
BEN Honey, did you hear what I just said?
BEN I gotta get this offering statement out.
Ben picks up some papers, but Janine is not giving up.
JANINE Look, I am trying here.
JANINE Do you want to save our marriage or don't you?
Janine looks at Ben.
Ben is SILENT.
Anna sits, holding back tears, as she listens closely.
BEN Of course I do.
JANINE Then you'll let me do this.
Then a ZIPPER OPENING, a chair CREAKING -
JANINE (CONT'D) Yeah, just like that, yeah...
We HOLD ON Anna as she sits there, stonefaced.
Alex has the staff (of about 10) assembled for the pre- shift meeting.
He consults a clipboard as he talks.
ALEX OK - Tyrone you bus 4 through 6 - and pitch in with the servers when you -
TYRONE No...I'm on 8 thru 10.
TYRONE I'm always on 8 through 10.
TYRONE Been working here 18 months doing 8 through 10.
ALEX Right.
ALEX Luis you take 4 through 6.
The staff looks at each other - perplexed.
TYRONE Dude.
TYRONE Luis quit like 10 months ago.
Alex rifles through his papers, not sure what he's looking for.
He slams his clipboard on the bar.
ALEX Do we even need to have this meeting?
ALEX Seriously?
ALEX Does this serve any purpose?
The group voice their opinions - a resounding "NO".
ALEX (CONT'D) Good.
ALEX (CONT'D) Great.
ALEX (CONT'D) Get to work.
The group disperses, Alex heads around the bar.
He sees Kelli Ann walking away and calls after her.
ALEX (CONT'D) Hey, Kelli Ann - any calls for me?
KELLI ANN Since you asked me 11 minutes ago?
KELLI ANN No, not a lot of phone traffic.
Kelli Ann starts to turn away as she sees Alex grab his cell phone, look at it, then put it down.
He grabs a beer, takes a swig - then grabs his cell phone again - staring at it, willing it to ring.
He puts it down again.
A HUGE SMILE grows on Kelli Ann's face.
KELLI ANN (CONT'D) Oh my god.
ALEX What?
KELLI ANN It's happened to you.
ALEX What has happened to me?
KELLI ANN What's her name?
ALEX Who?
KELLI ANN The girl, Alex.
ALEX There's no girl.
Alex takes his beer and heads down the bar.
KELLI ANN You can't hide it man.
KELLI ANN I know strung out and you are strung - out.
ALEX Please -
KELLI ANN This is amazing.
KELLI ANN Can't focus, right?
KELLI ANN Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your email 100 times a day.
KELLI ANN Wishing you could write songs.
KELLI ANN Feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations...
Alex stops at the office door.
KELLI ANN (CONT'D) It's always the same.
KELLI ANN (CONT'D) And it has happened to you, my friend.
KELLI ANN (CONT'D) Trust me.
Alex looks at Kelli Ann, her words settling in.
ALEX Shit.
Kelli Ann smiles, and as she walks away -
KELLI ANN Welcome to my world asshole.
Alex takes this in, KNOWING SHE'S RIGHT.
Janine, now fully dressed, hovers by the door.
Ben is back at his desk, eyes on his computer.
JANINE You sure I can't interest you in a little beef and broccoli?
JANINE I'm treating.
BEN I really gotta get this stuff done.
Janine is clearly flailing.
She starts to go.
JANINE OK.
JANINE I'll see you at home.
JANINE I love you.
She looks at Ben.
He has no choice.
BEN I love you too.
Janine leaves.
As soon as she's gone, Ben gets up, shuts the office door - and goes to the closet - when the door
BEN (CONT'D) I had no choice.
BEN (CONT'D) What was I supposed to do when she -
ANNA You make me sick to my stomach.
ANNA You are a disgusting excuse for a man -
Anna pulls her clothes back on in a FURY.
BEN I didn't want to do it, Anna.
BEN You know that it's you I want to be with -
He puts out a hand to try to touch her.
She RECOILS.
ANNA Are you kidding me?
ANNA You will never lay a hand on me again.
ANNA I may just be a piss poor girl from Dundalk who works at a gym - but I am so too good for you.
Anna storms out.
Gigi sits on her couch, a pile of BILLS in her lap - most of which say LATE, OVERDUE, etc.
She's on the PHONE.
GIGI Dino, thank you again for letting me pay over the phone.
GIGI I assure you this late payment thing will never happen again.
GIGI Yep -- just trying to trim some of the drama out of my life.
GIGI (CONT'D) That's my other line.
GIGI (CONT'D) OK.
GIGI (CONT'D) B-bye.
Gigi CLICKS OVER.
GIGI (CONT'D) Hello?
MANS' VOICE Hi, Gigi.
MANS' VOICE This is Bill.
GIGI Ummm -
BILL Alex's friend.
BILL We were supposed to meet up - but Alex told me the wrong day.
Gigi lets this sink in.
GIGI Bill.
GIGI So you do exist.
BILL I do.
BILL And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime if you're game.
GIGI Yes.
GIGI Sure.
GIGI Why not?
She puts on a smile.
Anna stands in the cluttered kitchen of her mom's house.
She writes out a CHECK, leaves it on the counter.
She looks to the living room, where Maya sleeps on the couch.
She watches her for a second, struggling with a blanket, before heading over to her.
She crouches next to the couch, helps her adjust the blanket.
ANNA I'm gonna go.
ANNA I left the check on the counter.
ANNA It should at least get you through this month.
Maya opens her eyes and looks up at her, smiling.
MAYA Thanks sweetie.
MAYA I don't know what I would do without you.
Maya closes her eyes again.
Anna sits there, watching her.
Anna's eyes start to fill with tears - quietly, she begins crying.
Maya finally notices.
MAYA (CONT'D) Baby - what's the matter?
Maya struggles to sit up and hug her.
Anna sits next to her on the couch, still trying to get it together.
MAYA (CONT'D) Is it money?
MAYA (CONT'D) Because you can take back the check if -
ANNA No, it's not that.
ANNA I mean - yes, I'm broke - but it's not that.
ANNA It's just -
ANNA I'm just so lost mom.
ANNA I've been seeing this guy - who is exciting and amazing and thoroughly unavailable.
ANNA I thought he was - the one - but he turned out to be such an asshole.
ANNA Maya nods, almost smiling.
ANNA (CONT'D) And then there's -
MAYA Conor -
ANNA Yeah.
ANNA Who I'm so horrible to.
ANNA But he takes it.
ANNA And he's - there.
ANNA Waiting.
ANNA But I just don't want to - I don't know -
MAYA Settle?
MAYA Like you think I did?
MAYA Anna looks at her mother, guilty.
MAYA (CONT'D) Well, your father and I had a glorious life together.
ANNA Are you kidding?
ANNA All you talk about are the things you didn't do, the people you wish you could have been with, the Tim Buckleys - anything but the life you actually had.
ANNA Maya looks at her daughter.
MAYA Those are just dreams Anna.
MAYA Anna tries to process this.
MAYA (CONT'D) Now true - I did not like your father at all when we met.
MAYA (CONT'D) Or after we got married for that matter.
MAYA (CONT'D) But let me tell you this - life with him was a hell of a lot better than life is without him.
MAYA (CONT'D) Maya stands, walks slowly toward the kitchen.
MAYA (CONT'D) There are worse things in life than settling.
ANNA Like what?
MAYA Like wishing you had.
MAYA Anna considers this.
INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Anna lays on her bed, staring at the ceiling.
INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The doorbell RINGS, Anna gets up to answer it.
INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Almost as soon as she turns the knob, Conor is standing in the middle of her studio apartment.
INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT He is all amped up.
ANNA Hey, sweetie.
ANNA She reaches up to give him a hug, he doesn't go for it.
CONOR See, why did you call me sweetie?
CONOR Anna looks confused.
ANNA Because we always call each other that.
CONOR Why?
CONOR Anna doesn't have an answer for that.
CONOR (CONT'D) I want to say something, OK?
CONOR (CONT'D) I mean, we call each other sweetie, and we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours and I washed your hair for you after you had that shoulder surgery and everything - it's like we're together.
ANNA I know that I -
CONOR Let me finish.
CONOR Maybe it's my fault.
CONOR Maybe I haven't been clear about what I want.
CONOR So let me be clear.
CONOR I love hanging out, but I am so attracted to you, and I just - I want both.
CONOR I want to make love to you.
CONOR I know that sounds kind of embarrassing coming out of my mouth - I just freaked myself out, too - but it's true.
CONOR And I'm not sure what happened, or why we stopped - but I don't really care.
CONOR I just --
OK. Conor is STUNNED.
CONOR What?

BETH (CONT'D) Our life together is what I want.
BETH (CONT'D) Your love is what I want.
BETH (CONT'D) Did you see those guys my sisters are married to?
BETH (CONT'D) You are a better husband to me - without being married - than any of those real husbands will ever be.
BETH (CONT'D) And that's enough for me.
NEIL And you'd really be OK if we take the marriage thing off the table?
BETH If you promise to love me and be committed to me -
NEIL I always have -
BETH Wait, I'm not done.
BETH And snake the shower drain when my hair clogs it, and let me eat Wheat Thins in bed.

CONOR (CONT'D) Conor takes her hands in his.
CONOR (CONT'D) Anna starts to PANIC.
CONOR (CONT'D) So what do you think?

CONOR OK.
CONOR If it's too fast -
ANNA No.
ANNA I mean this.
ANNA Any of this.
ANNA What you're saying - what you're offering - is what every girl wants.
ANNA It's what I've always wanted.
ANNA It's just -
ANNA Anna looks at him for a long time, not knowing how to say this.
ANNA Conor looks at her, struggling, and suddenly sees it in her face.
ANNA The answer he's been looking for.

GIGI Well, a wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl, he will make it happen.
GIGI No matter what.
ALEX True.
GIGI Hmmm.
GIGI Because when I was hurling my body onto yours - you did not seem to want to "make it happen."
ALEX Here's the thing about that.
ALEX You were right.
ALEX I've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from these women, having the power - that I didn't know what it felt like when I actually - fell - for one of them.
ALEX Gigi considers this.
GIGI Look, I've just been out with your friend Bill.
