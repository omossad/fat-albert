Star Wars: Episode 1:The Phantom Menace
TITLE CARD : A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title, followed by a roll up, which crawls up into infinity.
Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic.
The taxation of trade routes to outlaying star systems is in dispute.
Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo.
While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict.....
PAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great speed.
PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of Naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.
In the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one of the battleships.
QUI-GON : (off screen voice) Captain.
The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.
CAPTAIN : Yes, sir?
QUI-GON : (V.O) Tell them we wish to board at once.
CAPTAIN : Yes, sir.
The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade viceroy, waits for a reply.
CAPTAIN : (cont'd) With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the Ambassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.
NUTE : Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to recieve the Ambassador...Happy to.
The screen goes black.
Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship looms ever closer.
The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation battleship.
A PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay.
Two WORKER DROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.
PK-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless protocol gearheads to greet them.
The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay.
Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.
TC-14 : I'm TC-14 at your service.
This way, please.
They move off down the hallway.
EG-9 : A Republic cruiser!
That's trouble...don't you think?
PR-4 : I'm not made to think.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM A door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the formal conference room by TC-14.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM TC-14 : I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM My master will be with you shortly.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM He backs out the door and it closes.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window at the lush green planet of Naboo.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white hair in a ponytail.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM He is tall and striking, with blue eyes.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM OBI-WAN is twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM Several exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM OBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM QUI-GON : I don't sense anything.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM OBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands?
QUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards.
The negotiations will be short.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-14.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE What did you say?
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE TC-14 : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE DOFINE : I knew it!
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE Blind me, we're done for!
A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference room hallway.
NUTE : They must be dead by now.
Blast, what's left of them.
The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the door.
A deadly green cloud billows from the room.
BATTLE DROIDS cock their weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke.
It is TC-14 , carrying the tray of drinks.
TC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.
The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they can fire.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE The bridge is a cocophony of alarms.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the viewscreen.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE RUNE gives NUTE a worried look.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE RUNE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE : Well, not exactly, but I don't...(panicked) Seal off the bridge.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!
RUNE : We will not survive this.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and metal parts.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS crashing into the wall.
QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then a third.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE QUI-GON tabs the door with his sword.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the center of the blast door.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.
NUTE : Impossible!!
This is impossible!!
RUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE Just before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their battle configuration.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE QUI-GON can't see them but senses their presence.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE The WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways, blasting away with their laser guns.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE They stop firing and stand in a semi-circle as the smoke clears.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be seen.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the doorway that slams shut.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with their laser swords.
OBI-WAN : They have shield generators!
QUI-GON : It's a standoff!
Let's go!
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.
RUNE : We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer droids.
TEY HOW : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay.
They are careful not to be seen.
Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing craft.
QUI-GON : Battle droids.
OBI-WAN : It's an invisible army.
QUI-GON : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation.
We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum.
Let's split up.
Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.
OBI-WAN : You were right about one thing, Master.
The negotiations were short.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE TEY HOW recieves a transmission.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE : At last we're getting results.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE Wearing her elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE : (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE AMIDALA : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE smirks at RUNE.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE : I was not aware of such a failure.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE AMIDALA : I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of yours.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE : I take it you know the outcome.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE I wonder why they bother to vote.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE I'm aware the Chancellor's Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a settlement.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE : I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE You assume too much.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE RUNE : Do you think she suspects an attack?
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE : I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there.
The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.
PALPATINE : ...How could that be true?
I have assurances from the Chancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive.
It must be the...get...negotiate...
The hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.
AMIDALA : Senator Palpatine?!?
(turns to Panaka) What's happening?
CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT
CAPT.
PANAKA : Check the transmission generators...
BIBBLE : A malfunction?
CAPT.
PANAKA : It could be the Federation jamming us.
Your Highness.
BIBBLE : A communications disruption can only mean one thing.
Invasion.
AMIDALA : Don't jump to conclusions, Governor.
The Federation would not dare go that far.
CAPT.
PANAKA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished.
AMIDALA : We must continue to rely on negotiation.
BIBBLE : Negotiation?
We've lost all communications!...and where atre the Chancellors Ambassadors?
How can we negotiate?
We must prepare to defend ourselves.
CAPT.
PANAKA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness.
Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.
AMIDALA : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.
Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo.
Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the perpetually gray twilight side of the planet.
One by one, the Federation warships land in the eerie swamp.
OBI-WAN's head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake.
For in the background, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist.
OBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again under the muddy swamp.
Troop Transports (MTT's) emerge from the landing craft.
The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain.
OOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the rolling hills.
A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands on the tank.
RUNE : ...and there is no trace of the Jedi.
They may have gotton onto one of your landing craft.
OOM-9 : If they are down here, sir, we'll find them.
We are moving out of the swamp and are marching on the cities.
We are meeting no resistance.
NUTE : Excellent.
QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist.
Animals begin to run past him in a panic.
An odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he has retrieved from the murky swamp.
The shell pops open.
JAR JAR's greta tongue snaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp.
JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the wind toward him.
One of the huge MTT's bears down on the JEDI like a charging locomotive.
JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam shell in one hand.
JAR JAR : Oh, noooooooooo!
JAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes.
The JEDI is caught by surprise.
JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Hey, help me!
Help me!!
QUI-GON : Let go!
The machine is about tp crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR behind him.
Just as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON drops, and JAR JAR goes splat into the mud with him.
The transport races overhead.
QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud.
They stand watching the war machine dissapear into the mist.
JAR JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.
JAR JAR : Oyi, mooie-mooie!
I luv yous!
The frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.
QUI-GON : Are you brainless?
You almost got us killed!
JAR JAR : I spake.
QUI-GON : The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.
Now get outta here!
QUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows.
JAR JAR : No...no!
Mesa stay...Mesa yous humble servaunt.
QUI-GON : That wont be necessary.
JAR JAR : Oh boot tis!
Tis demunded byda guds.
Tis a live debett, tis.
Mesa culled Jaja Binkss.
In the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high speed, chasing
OBI-WAN. QUI-GON : I have no time for this now...
OBI-WAN. JAR JAR : Say what?
OBI-WAN. JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oh, nooooo!
OBI-WAN. Weesa ganna....
OBI-WAN. QUI-GON : Stay down!
OBI-WAN. JAR JAR : ...dieeee!
OBI-WAN. OBI-WAN : Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.
OBI-WAN. QUI-GON : You forgot to turn your power off again, didn't you?
OBI-WAN. QUI-GON : (cont'd) It won't take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I hope you've learned, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN. OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
OBI-WAN. JAR JAR : Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?
OBI-WAN. OBI-WAN : What's this?
OBI-WAN. QUI-GON : A local.
OBI-WAN. Let's go, before more of those droids show up.
OBI-WAN. JAR JAR : Mure?
OBI-WAN. Mure did you spake??!?
OBI-WAN. JAR JAR : (cont'd) Ex-squeeze me, but da moto grande safe place would be Otoh Gunga.
OBI-WAN. Tis where I grew up...Tis safe city.
OBI-WAN. QUI-GON : A city!
OBI-WAN. (JAR JAR nods his head) Can you take us there?
OBI-WAN. JAR JAR : Ahhh, will...on second taut...no, not willy.
OBI-WAN. QUI-GON : No??!
OBI-WAN. JAR JAR : Iss embarrissing, boot...
OBI-WAN. My afrai my've bean banished.
OBI-WAN. My forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my.
OBI-WAN. Terrible tings if my goen back dare.
OBI-WAN. QUI-GON : You hear that?
OBI-WAN. QUI-GON : (cont'd) That's the sound of a thousand terrible things heading this way...
OBI-WAN. OBI-WAN : When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little pieces, then blast us into oblivion!
OBI-WAN. JAR JAR : Oh!
OBI-WAN. Yousa point is well seen.
OBI-WAN. Dis way!
OBI-WAN. Hurry!
JAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp.
QUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR tries to catch his breath.
The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance.
QUI-GON : Much farther?
JAR JAR : Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that turn into breathing masks.
JAR JAR : (cont'd) My warning yous.
Gungans no liken outlaunders.
Don't expict a wern welcome.
OBI-WAN : Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes.
JAR JAR jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the water.
Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the water.
Down they swim into murky depths.
In the distance the glow of Otoh Gunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.
They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat.
JAR JAR swims magically through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him.
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON follow.
INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI.
INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE Four GUARDS armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged KAADUS into the square.
INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE The GUARDS, led by CAPTAIN TARPALS, point their lethal poles at the dripping trio.
INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE CAPT.
INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE TARPALS gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole.
INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE JAR JAR jumps and moves off, followed by the two JEDI.
JAR JAR : How wude.
The Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming around outside like moving stars.
A long circular judge's bench filled with GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room.
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS NASS, who sits on a bench higher than the others.
BOSS NASS : Yousa cannot bees hair.
Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis new weesong!
QUI-GON : That droid army is about to attack the Naboo.
We must warn them.
BOSS NASS : Wesa no like da Naboo!
Un dey no like uss-ens.
Da Naboo tink day so smarty den us-ens.
Day tink day brains so big.
OBI-WAN : After those droids take control of the surface, they will come here and take control of you.
BOSS NASS : No, mesa no tink so.
Mesa scant talkie witda Naboo, and no nutten talkie it outlaunders.
Dos mackineeks no comen here!
Dey not know of uss-en.
OBI-WAN : You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle.
What happens to noe of you will affect the other.
You must understand this.
BOSS NASS : Wesa wish no nutten in yousa tings, outlaunder, and wesa no care-n about da Naboo.
QUI-GON : (waves his hand) Then speed us on our way.
BOSS NASS : Wesa gonna speed yousaway.

BOSS NASS : Wesa give yousa una bongo.
Da speedest way tooda Naboo tis goen through da core.
Now go.
QUI-GON : Thank you for your help.
We go in peace.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave.
OBI-WAN : Master, whats a bongo?
QUI-GON : A transport, I hope.
The JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to hear his verdict.
QUI-GON stops.
JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look.
JAR JAR : Daza setten yous up.
Goen through da planet core is bad bombin!!
QUI-GON : Thank you, my friend.
JAR JAR : Ahhh...any hep hair would be hot.
JAR JAR's soulful look is counterpointed by a sheepish grin.
OBI-WAN : We are short of time, Master.
QUI-GON : We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core.
This Gungan my be of help.
QUI-GON walks bact to BOSS NASS.
QUI-GON : (cont'd) What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?
BOSS NASS : Binkss brokeen the nocombackie law.
Hisen to be pune-ished.
QUI-GON : He has been a great help to us.
I hope the punishment will not be too severe.
BOSS NASS : Pounded unto death.
JAR JAR : (grimacing) Oooooh...Ouch!
OBI-WAN looks concerned.
QUI-GON is thinking.
QUI-GON : We need a navigator to get us through the planet's core.
I have saved Jar Jar Binks' life.
He owes me what you call a "life.debt."
BOSS NASS : Binks.
Yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?
JAR JAR nods and joins the JEDI.
QUI-GON waves his hand.
QUI-GON : Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.
BOSS NASS : Hisen live tis yos, outlauder.
Begone wit him.
JAR JAR : Count mesa outta dis!
Better dead here, den deader in da core...Yee guds, whata mesa sayin?!
A strange little submarine propels itself away from the Otoh Gunga, leaving the glow of the settlement in the distance.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER OBI-WAN in the co-pilots seat, JAR JAR guides the craft.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER OBI-WAN : Master, why do you keep dragging these pathetic life forms along with us?...Here, take over.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER QUI-GON : You're the navigator.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER JAR JAR veers the craft to the left and turns the lights on.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER The coral vistas are grand, fantastic, and wonderous.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER OBI-WAN : Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER OBI-WAN : They banished you because you're clumsy?
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark shape begins to follow.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER Suddenly there is a loud CRASH, and the little craft lurches to one side.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER QUI-GON looks around and sees a huge, lumimnous OPEE SEA KILLER has hooked them with its long gooey tongue.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER Instead of full ahead, JAR JAR jams the controls into reverse.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER The sub flies into the mouth of the creature.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER OBI-WAN takes over the controls and the OPEE SEA KILLER instantly releases the sub from its mouth.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on the hapless KILLER.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER The jaws belong to the incredible SANDO AQUA MONSTER.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER The lights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the gloom.
QUI-GON : There's always a bigger fish.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE I have the Senate bogged down in procedures.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE You will find controlling her will not be difficult.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE You have done well, Viceroy.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE DARTH SIDIOUS fades away.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE RUNE : You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi?
NUTE : No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER Sparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER The sound of the power drive drops.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER OBI-WAN is working with the sparking wires.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER JAR JAR panics.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER We're not in trouble yet.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER You nutsen!
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER The lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in front of them.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER The large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER The sub turns around and speeds away.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER QUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR's shoulder.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER JAR JAR relaxes into a coma.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER OBI-WAN : You overdid it.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER The COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO AQUA MONSTER.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER JAR JAR regains consciousness.
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER JAR JAR : Wesa dead yet??
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER Oie Boie!
INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER QUI-GON : Head for that outcropping.
The long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road leading to Theed, the Naboo capital.
As the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport carrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza.
They exit the transport.
NUTE : Ah, victory!
The little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is brightly lit.
JAR JAR : Wesa dude it!
Paradise.
Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water.
There is a LOUD RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.
The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast moving river.
OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies.
QUI-GON stands up to look around.
JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief.
JAR JAR : Wesa safe now.
QUI-GON : Get this thing started.
JAR JAR : Dissen berry good.
Hey?
OBI-WAN : What is it?
JAR JAR looks back to where they're drifting.
He sees they are headed for a huge waterfall.
JAR JAR : What!!??
Oie boie!
OBI-WAN tries to start the engine.
The long props behind the sub slowly begin to rotate.
OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop drifting backward in the powerful current.
The sub slowly moves forward.
In the background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt.
The engine coughs and dies.
They start drifting backward again.
JAR JAR panics.
JAR JAR : (cont'd) Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey!
QUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the shore.
The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs precariously over the edge of the waterfall.
QUI-GON : Come on...
OBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable.
QUI-GON starts in after him.
QUI-GON : (cont'd) Come on, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR : No!
Too scary!
OBI-WAN : Get up here!
JAR JAR : No a mighty no!
JAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.
JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oie boie...mesa comen.
Mesa comen!
JAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub.
OBI-WAN is on shore and helps to pull QUI-GON out of the water.
OBI-WAN : That was close.
BATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) Drop your weapons!
The TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them.
JAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI.
BATTLE DROID 3B3 : I said drop your weapons
QUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut down by the JEDI.
A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks lose, crashing down the waterfall.
The JEDI move on.
JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.
JAR JAR : Whoa!!!
The waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun.
INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY QUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE, PADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY DROIDS.
INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY CAPTAIN PANAKA and FOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at gunpoint.
INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY NUTE and RUNE stand in the middle of the room.
INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY BIBBLE : ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY I've been assured it will be ratified by the Senate.
INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY AMIDALA : I will not co-operate.
INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY You are not going to like what we have in store for your people.
INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY In time, their suffering will persuade you to see our point of view.
INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY The SERGEANT marches the GROUP out of the throne room.
and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS.
The plaza is filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the detention camp.
Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an attack to rescue the QUEEN.
FOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down.
MORE DROIDS move forward and are also cut down by the JEDIS' flashing lightsabres until there is only the DROID SERGEANT left.
The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to QUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.
JAR JAR : Yousa guys bombad!
QUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed.
JAR JAR is getting used to this.
They move between two buildings.
QUI-GON : Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme Chancellor.
BIBBLE : Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.
QUI-GON : The negotiations never took place.
Your Highness, we must make contact with the republic.
CAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.
CAPT.
PANAKA : They've knocked out all our communications.
QUI-GON : Do you have transports?
CAPT.
PANAKA : In the main hanger.
This way.
THEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded
CAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger.
QUI-GON looks in over his shoulder.
OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the rest of the group are behind him.
They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE DROIDS.
ALARMS can be heard in the distance.
CAPT.
PANAKA : There are too many of them.
QUI-GON : That won't be a problem.
(to Amidala) Your Highness, under the circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.
QUI-GON : They will kill you if you stay.
BIBBLE : They wouldn't dare.
CAPT.
PANAKA : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of theirs legal.
They can't afford to kill her.
QUI-GON : The situation here is not what it seems.
There is something else behind all this, Your Highness.
There is no logic in the Federation's move here.
My feelings tell me they will destroy you.
BIBBLE : Please, Your Highness, reconsider.
Our only hope is for the Senate to side with us...
Senator Palpatine will need your help.
CAPT.
PANAKA : Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness.
Any attempt to escape will be dangerous.
BIBBLE : Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control.
But you must leave...
The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.
AMIDALA : Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...
PADME : We are brave, Your Highness.
QUI-GON : If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.
AMIDALA : Then, I will plead our case before the Senate.
(to Bibble) Be careful, Governor.
The door opens to the main hanger.
QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME, EIRTAE, RABE), followed by QUEEN AMIDALA, head for a sleek chrome spacecraft.
SIO BIBBLE, YANE and SACHE stay behind.
The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.
CAPT.
PANAKA : We need to free those pilots.
CAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.
OBI-WAN : I'll take care of that.
OBI-WAN heads toward the group of captured pilots.
QUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft.
GUARD DROID : Where are you going?
QUI-GON : I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking those people to Coruscant.
DROID GUARD : You're under arrest!
The DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire, they are cut down.
OTHER GUARDS run to their aid.
OBI-WAN attacks the GUARDS around the PILOTS.
QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS rush on board the spacecraft.
OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC OLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship.
The OTHER PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLR.
After everyone has made it onto the ship, QUI-GONjumps on board.
ALARMS sound.
MORE DROIDS rush into the hanger and fire as the ship takes off.
The ship exits the hanger.
BATTLE DROIDS standing in the hanger shoot at them.
The sleek spacecraft speeds away from the planet of Naboo and heads for the deadly Federation blockade.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT The PILOT, RIC OLIE, navigates toward the massive battleship, QUI-GON and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch.
RIC OLIE : ....our communications are still jammed.
JAR JAR is led into a low, cramped doorway by OBI-WAN.
OBI-WAN : Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.
OBI-WAN closes the door.
JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units).
The all look alike, except for thier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.
JAR JAR : Ello, boyos.
(no response) Disa wanna longo trip...hey?
JAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit.
He lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.
JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Tis opens?...Oooops!
Many springs and things come flying out.
JAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.
JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Yoi!
Just yoken!
RIC OLIE : Powers back!
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.
Deflector shield up, at maximum.
The lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship.
The Naboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.
RIC OLIE : There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive is leaking.
QUI-GON : We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.
QUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.
OBI-WAN : Here, Master.
Tatooine...
It's small, out of the way, poor...
The Trade Federation has no presence there.
CAPT.
PANAKA : How can you be sure?
QUI-GON : It's controlled by the Hutts...
CAPT.
PANAKA : The Hutts??
OBI-WAN : It's risky...but there's no alternative.
CAPT.
PANAKA : You can't take Her Royal Highness there!
The Hutts are gangsters...
If they discovered her...
QUI-GON : ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system controlled by the Federation...except the Hutts aren't looking for her, which gives us an advantage.
CPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.
EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX) The Naboo spacecraft races away.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM NUTE and RUNE sit around a conference table with a hologram of DARTH
NUTE : We control all the cities in the North and are searching for any other settlements...
DARTH SIDIOUS : Destroy all high-ranking officials, Viceroy...slowly...quietly.
And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?
NUTE : She has disappeared, My Lord.
One Naboo cruiser got pat the blockade.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, find her!
I want that treaty signed.
NUTE : My Lord, it's impossible to locate the ship.
It's out of our range.
DARTH SIDIOUS : ...not for a Sith...
A second SITH LORD appears behind DARTH SIDIOUS.
DARTH SIDIOUS : (Cont'd) ...Viceroy, this is my apprentice.
Lord Maul.
He will find your lost ship.
NUTE : Yes, My Lord.
The hologram fades off.
NUTE : (Cont'd) This is getting out of hand...now there are two of them.
RUNE : We should not have made this bargain.
What will happen when the Jedi become aware of these Sith Lords?

PANAKA : R2-D2, Your Highness.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Artoo Detoo.
You have proven to be very loyal...Padme!
PADME bows before the QUEEN.
AMIDALA : (Cont'd) Clean this droid up the best you can.
It deserves our gratitude...(to Panaka) Continue, Captain.
CAPTAIN PANAKA looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.
QUI-GON : Yor Highness, we are heading for a remote planet called Tatooine.
It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation.
There we will be able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.
CAPTAIN PANAKA : Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous.
It's controlled by an alliance of gangs called the Hutts.
I do not agree with the Jedi on this.
QUI-GON : You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.
AMIDALA and PADME exchange looks.
PADME moves next to the DROID.

RIC OLIE searches his scopes.
OBI-WAN : Tahyt's it.
Tatooine.
RIC OLIE : There's a settlement...a spaceport, looks like.
QUI-GON : Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract any attention.
The ship heads toward the planet of Tatooine.
The Naboo spacecraft lands in the desert in a swirl of dust.
The spaceport of Mos Espa is seen in the distance.
OBI-WAN is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel.
JAR JAR rushes up to him and falls to his knees.
JAR JAR : Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go!
OBI-WAN : Sorry, Qui-Gon's right.
You'll make things less obvious.
JAR JAR walks back to ARTOO in the hallway as QUI-GON (dressed as a farmer) enters the main area.
OBI-WAN : (Cant'd) The Hyperdrive generator is gone.
We will need a new one.
QUI-GON moves closer to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly to him.
QUI-GON : Don't let them send ant transmissions.
Be wary...I sense a disturbance in the Force.

He stands before a hyperdrive.
WATTO : ...Here it is...a T-14 hyperdrive generator!!
Thee in luck, I'm the only one hereabouts who has one...but thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think...Sying of which, how's thee going to pay for all this?
QUI-GON : I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
WATTO : Republic credits?!?
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real...
QUI-GON : I don't have anything else.
(raising his hand) But credits will do fine.
WATTO : No they won'ta.
QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand again.
QUI-GON : Credits will do fine.

What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your hand around like that?
I'm a Toydarian.
Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only money.
No money, no parts!
No deal!
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY JAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it, and they all come tumblimg down.

ANAKIN lets out a "yipee" and runs out the back.
QUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot between two buildings.
The busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking creatures.
QUI-GON is talking on his com-link, while JAR JAR nervously watches the street.
OBI-WAN is in the main hold of the Naboo craft.
QUI-GON : ...Obi-Wan, you're sure there isn't anything of value left on board?
OBI-WAN : (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe.
Not enough for you to barter with.
Not in the ammounts you're talking about.
QUI-GON : All right.
Another solution will present itself.
I'll check back.
QUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street.
JAR JAR grabs his arm.
JAR JAR : Noah gain...da beings hereabouts cawazy.
Wesa be robbed un crunched.
QUI-GON : Not likely.
We have nothing of value, that's our problem.
QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street.
JAR JAR is walking behind the others.
They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough gang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like creature.
JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs hanging on a wire.
He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks out his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth.
Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire.
The vendor suddenly appears.
VENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!
JAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets around the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him.
As JAR JAR moves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the hapless Gungan.
SEBULBA : (subtitled) Chuba!!
(You!!)
JAR JAR : Who, mesa??
SEBULBA :
SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly.
SEVERAL OTHER CREATURES start to gather.
SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground.
The Gungan desperately tries to scramble to safety.
JAR JAR : (to himself) Why mesa always da one??
ANAKIN : (V.O) Because you're afraid.
JAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him.
The boy stands up to SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana.
(Careful, Sebulba...This one's very connected.)
SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.
SEBULBA : (subtitled) Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag.
(Connected??
Whada you mean, slave?)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Oh da Hutt...cha porko ootman geesa...me teesa rodda co pana pee choppa chawa.
(As in Hutt...big time outlander, this one...
I'd hate to see you diced before we race again.)
SEBULBA : (subtitled) Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma klounkee(Next time we race, wermo, it will be the end of you!)
Una noto wo shag, me wompity du pom pom.
(If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you right now.)
SEBULBA turns away.
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra.
(Yeah, it'd be a pity if you had to pay for me.)
QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hi!
Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo.
He picked a fight with a Dug.
An especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.
JAR JAR : Nosir, nosir.
Mesa hate crunchen.
Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.
QUI-GON : Nevertheless, the boy is right...you were heading for trouble.
Thank you, my young friend.
PADME looks at ANAKINB and smiles; he smiles back.
They start walking down the crowded street.
JAR JAR : Mesa doen nutten!
ANAKIN : Fear attracts the fearful.
He was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you...be less afraid.
PADME : And that works for you.
ANAKIN : To a point.
(he smiles)

ANAKIN : How are you feeling today, Jira?
JIRA : The heat's never been kind to me, you know, Annie!
ANAKIN : Guess what?
I've found that cooling unit I've been searching for.
It's pretty beat up, but I'll have it fixed up for you in no time, I promise.
JIRA : You're a fine boy, Annie.
ANAKIN : I'll take four pallies today.
(to Padme) You'll like these...
ANAKIN reaches in his pocket and comes up with three coins.
He drops one.
QUI-GON picks it up, revealing for a moment, his lightsabre.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Whoops, I thought I had more...Make thgat three, I'm not hungry.
The wind picks up.
SHOP OWNERS are starting to close up their shops as JIRA gives them their pallies.
JIRA : Gracious, my bones are aching...storm's coming on, Annie.
You'd better get home quick.
ANAKIN : (to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter?
QUI-GON : We'll hed back to our ship.
ANAKIN : Is it far?
PADME : On the outskirts.
ANAKIN : You'll never reach the outskirts in time...sandstorms are very, very dangerous.
Come with me.
Hurry!
The GROUP follows ANAKIN as he rushes down the windy street.
The wind is blowing hard as QUI-GON, JAR JAR, and PADME follow ANAKIN down the street and into a slave hovel.

SHMI : Oh, tank you.
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry if I was abrupt.
I'll never get used to Anakin's surprises.
QUI-GON : He's a very special boy.
SHMI looks at him as if he's discovered a secret.
SHMI : Yes, I know.
ANAKIN shows off his ANDROID, which is lying on his workbench.
There is one eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have no outer coverings.
ANAKIN : Isn't he great?!
He's not finished yet.
PADME : He's wonderful!
ANAKIN : You reall like him?
He's a protocol droid...to help Mom.
Watch!
ANAKIN pushes a switch, and the DROID sits up.
Anakin rushes around, grabs an eye and puts it in one of the sockets.
THREEPIO : How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations.
How might I serve you?
PADME : He's perfect.
ANAKIN : When the storm is over, you can see my racer.
I'm building a Podracer!
PADME smiles at his enthusiasm.
ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and whistles.
THREEPIO : I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked?
THREEPIO : (Cont'd) My parts are showing?
Oh, my goodness.
How embarrassing!
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad transmission of a SIO BIBBLE hologram.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS BIBBLE : ...cut off all food supplies until you return...the death toll is catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness...Please tell us what to do!
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me...

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON : Either way, we're running out of time.
DARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city.
DARTH MAUL : Tatooine is sparsely populated.
If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty.
DARTH MAUL : At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi.
At last we will have revenge.
DARTH SIDIOUS : You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will be no match for you.
It is too late for them to stop us now.
Everything is going as planned.
The Republic will soon be in my command.
The hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks out over the city.
EXT.
MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY
The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the outskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY SHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no luck.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY SHMI : Any attempt to escape...
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof!
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY PADME and JAR JAR are horrified.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY PADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY SHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY An awkward silence.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace?
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY PADME shakes her head no.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY She notices the concern of SHMI.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY JAR JAR snatches some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY SHMI looks askance at her son.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY I'm not bragging.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN smiles.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and forefinger.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY JAR JAR is startled.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON lets go of the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON : What makes you think that?
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : I saw your laser sword.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : I don't think so...
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON : I wish that were so...
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY I had a dream I was a Jedi.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY I came back here and freed all the slaves...have you come to free us?
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not...
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON thinks for a moment.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't let anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept secret.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY PADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : I can help!
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY I can fix anything!
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we need...
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY SHMI : Gambling.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : I've built a racer!
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY You could enter my pod.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY SHMI : Anakin, settle down.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY Watto won't let you...
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY (to Qui-Gon) You could make him think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY QUI-GON looks to SHMI.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY She is upset.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY SHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY I die every time Watto makes you do it.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY JAR JAR : Wesa ina pitty bad goo.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY GUI-GON : Your mother's right.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might be able to help us?
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY SHMI shakes her head no.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other...
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY SHMI : Anakin, don't...
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY PADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY We will find another way...
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY SHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way...
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY I may not like it, but he can help you...he was meant to help you.
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY ANAKIN : Is that a yes?
INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY That is a yes!
The storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.
EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY The storm has passed.
EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY VENDORS and STREET PEOPLE clean up the mess and rebuild their food stalls.
EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY JAR JAR sits on a box in front of Watto's parts shop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness.
EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY ARTOO is standing next to him.
EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop.
EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY PADME : Are you sure about this?
EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY PADME : Well, I don't approve.
EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY QUI-GON turns and starts into the shop.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY WATTO and ANAKIN are in the middle of an animated discussion in Huttese.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY QUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY WATTO : The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY You can't afford parts.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY How can you do this?
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY Not on Republic credits, I think.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of WATTO.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY He studies it.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY I actually saved the Pod...mostly.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY WATTO : (laughing) That you did.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY QUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY WATTO : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY (laughs) So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY We split the winnings fifty-fifty, I think.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY WATTO thinks about this.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.
INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Either way, you win.
OBI-WAN stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his comlink.
QUI-GON is on the back porch of the hovel.
OBI-WAN : What if this plan fails, Master?
We could be stuck here for a long time.
QUI-GON : (V.O) A ship without a power supply will not get us anywhere, and there is something about this boy...
QUI-GON puts the comlink away as SHMI comes onto the porch
PADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and ARTOO work on the engines of the Podracer in the courtyard below.
QUI-GON : You should be proud of your son.
He gives without any thought of reward.
SHMI : He knows nothing of greed.
He has...
QUI-GON : He has special powers.
SHMI : Yes...
QUI-GON : He can see things before they happen.
That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes.
It is a Jedi trait.
SHMI : He deserves better than a slave's life.
QUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear.
Who was his father?
SHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him birth...I can't explain what happened.
Can you help him?
QUI-GON : I'm afraid not.
Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the way.
But it's too late for him now, he's too old.
KITSTER (a young boy about Anakin's age), SEEK (a boy of ten), AMEE (a girl of six), and WALD (a Greedo Type, six years old) join ANAKIN, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME securing some wiring.
ANAKIN : Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and seek, Amee, and Wald.
All whistle, hoot, and speak a greeting.
KITSTER : Wow, a real Astro Droid...how'd you get so lucky?
ANAKIN : This isn't the half of it.
I'm entered in the Boonta Race tomorrow!
KITSTER : What?
With this??
WALD : (subtitled) Annie, Jesko na joka.
9You are such a joke, Annie.)
AMEE : You've been working on that thing for years.
It's never going to run.
SEEK : Come on, let's go play ball.
Keep it up, Annie, and you're gonna be bug squash.
SEEK, WALD, and AMEE take off, laughing.
JAR JAR is fiddling with one of the energy binder plates.
ANAKIN : Hey!
Jar Jar!
Stay away from those energy binders...
JAR JAR : Who, mesa?
ANAKIN : If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.
JAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps him in the mouth and jumps back.
JAR JAR tries to say something, but his mouth is numb and his words are garbled.
JAR JAR : Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho.
(Gibberish) KITSTER : But you don't even know if this thing will run.
ANAKIN : It will.
QUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small battery.
JAR JAR gets his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to tell Anakin, but can't get words out that make sense.
QUI-GON : I think it's time we found out.
Use this power charge.
ANAKIN : Yes, sir!!
ANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines.
He puts the power pack back into the dashboard.
EVERYONE backs away, except for JAR JAR who calls for help.
Finally PADME frees him and the engines ignite with a ROAR.
EVERYONE cheers.
SHMI, watching from the porch, smiles sadly.
ANAKIN sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as QUI-GON tends to a cut.
The BOY leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the sky.
QUI-GON : Sit still, Annie.
Let me clean this cut.
ANAKIN : There are so many!
Do they all have a system of planets?
QUI-GON : Most of them.
ANAKIN : Has anyone been to them all?
QU-IG0N : (laughs) Not likely.
ANAKIN : I want to be the first one to see them all...
Ouch!
QUI-GON wipes a patch of blood off ANAKIN'S arm.
QUI-GON : There, good as new...
SHMI yells from inside the hovel.
SHMI : (O.S.)
Annie, bedtime!
QUI-GON scrapes ANAKIN's blood onto a comlink chip.
ANAKIN : What are you doing?
QUI-GON : Checking your blood for infections.
ANAKIN : I've never seen...
SHMI : (O.S.)
Annie!
I'm not goiung to tell you again!
QUI-GON : Go on, you have a big day tomorrow.
(beat) Goodnight.
ANAKIN rolls his eyes and runs into the hovel.
QUI-GON takes the blood stained chip and inserts it into the comlink, then calls OBI-WAN.
QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Obi-Wan...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
QUI-GON : Make an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.
OBI-WAN : Wait a minute...
QUI-GON : I need a midi-chlorian count.
OBI-WAN : All right.
I've got it.
QUI-GON : What are your readings?
OBI-WAN : Something must be wrong with the transmission.
QUI-GON : Here's a signal check.
OBI-WAN : Strange.
The transmission seems to be in good order, but the reading's off the chart...over twenty thousand.
QUI-GON : (almost to himself) That's it then.
OBI-WAN : Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!
QUI-GON : No Jedi has.
OBI-WAN : What does it mean?
QUI-GON : I'm not sure.
The JEDI KNIGHT looks up and sees SHMI in the doorway watching him.
Embarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while QUI-GON ponders the situation.
The sinister looking Sith spacecraft lands on top of a desert mesa at dus, scattering a herd of banthas.
DARTH MAUL walks to the edge of the mesa and studies the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars.
He picks out the lights of three different cities in the distance, then pushes buttons on his electronic armband.
Six football-sized PROBE DROIDS float out of the ship and head off in three different directions toward the cities.
DARTH MAUL stands on the mesa and watches them through his electrobinoculars.
Padme exits the hovel.
As the twin suns rise, ARTOO is busy painting the racing Pod.
ANAKIN is asleep.
PADME passes ARTOO.
PADME : I hope you're about finished.
ARTOO whistles a positive reply.
PADME sees KITSTER riding toward them on an EOPIE, a strange camel-lile creature.
He is leading a second EOPIE behind him.
PADME goes over to ANAKIN.
He looks very vulnerable as he sleeps.
She watches him, then touches him on the cheek.
ANAKIN wakes up, yawns, and looks at her, a little puzzled.
ANAKIN : You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.
PADME : I hope not; I hate fighting.
Your mother wants you to come in and clean up.
We have to leave soon.
ANAKIN stands up and stretches just as KITSTER arrives.
ANAKIN : Hook 'em up, Kitster.
(to Padme) I won't be long.
Where's Qui-Gon?
PADME : He and Jar Jar left already.
They're with Watto at the arena.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY WATTO : Not if your ship belongs to me, I think...I warn you, no funny business.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY QUI-GON : You don't think Anakin will win?
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY WATTO stops before an orange racer.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY Sitting to one side, having his shoulders and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is SEBULBA.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY I have great faith in the boy.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY He's a credit to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY (laughs) I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY QUI-GON : I'll take that bet.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY What do you mean?
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY QUI-GON : I'll wager my new racing pod against...say...the boy and his mother.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY I don't think so...well, poerhaps.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY WATTO shakes his head.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY WATTO shakes his head again.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY WATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY WATTO : We'll let fate decide.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY WATTO tosses the cube down.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY QUI-GON smiles.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY WATTO is angry.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY WATTO : (Cont'd) You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the race, so...it makes little difference.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY ANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES, pulling an engine.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY KITSTER, on the other EOPIE, is pulling another engine.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY With THREEPIO walking alongside, ARTOO trundles behind, pulling the Pod with SHMI sitting on it.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY WATTO passes ANAKIN as he leaves.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY WATTO walks off, laughing.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY QUI-GON : I'll tell you later.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY THREEPIO : Oh my!
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY Space travel sounds rather perilous.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY THREEPIO : I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships!
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY KITSTER : (to Anakin) This is so wizard!
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY I'm sure you'll do it this time, Annie.
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY PADME : Do what?
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY KITSTER : Finish the race, of course!
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY PADME : You've never won a race?
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY ANAKIN : Well...not exactly...
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY PADME : Not even finished?!
INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY ANAKIN : ...but Kitster's right, I will this time.

Remember how you collapses several times, exhausted thinking you couldn't do it?

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA Only I...miss...
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA ANAKIN is disturbed about something.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA Tears are in his eyes.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA PADME : ...You miss your mother.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA ANAKIN looks at her, unable to speak.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA She hugs him.
MOVE with the ship as it heads toward Coruscant.
The spacecraft dlies over the endlesscityscape of Coruscant, the capital of the galaxy.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT ANAKIN looks out the cockpit window in awe.
RIC OLIE : Coruscant...the capital of the Republic...the entire planet is one big city.
ANAKIN : Wow!
It's so huge!
The ship flies through the cityscape of Coruscant.
Supreme Chancellor VALORUM, SEVERAL GUARDS, and SENATOR PALPATINE stand on a landing platform.
The sleek Naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above the street level of the galactic capital.
The ramp lowers.
OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, JAR JAR and ANAKIN descend the ramp first and bow before PALPATINE and VALORUM.
CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA, then PADME, RABE, EIRTAE, and MORE GUARDS descend the ramp.
QUEEN AMIDALA stops before the group.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand to one side, looking at the huge city.
PADME smiles at ANAKIN.
PALPATINE bows before the Queen.
PALPATINE : It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty.
May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
VALORUM : Welcome, Your Highness.
It is an honor to finally meet you in person.
I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant situation.
I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your position.
AMIDALA : I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.
PALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off the platform toward a waiting air taxi.
PALPATINE : There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can overcome it...
JAR JAR and ANAKIN start to follow, then stop, noticing that OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are staying with the SUPREME CHANCELLOR.
QUEEN AMIDALA waves to the duo to follow her.
ANAKIN looks back to QUI-GON, and he nods to go ahead.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR join the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE and EIRTAE in the taxi.
PALPATINE gives the Gungan and the boy in the back of the taxi a skeptical look.
JAR JAR leans over to ANAKIN.
JAR JAR : Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks.
(he looks around) Pitty hot!
VALORUM and the JEDI watch the taxi move off into the city.
QUI-GON : I must speak with the Jei Council immediately, Your Honor.
The situation has become more complicated.
QUEEN AMIDALA is sitting listening to PALPATINE.
EIRTAE and RABE stand behind the QUEEN; PADME is nowhere to be sen.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR are waiting in an adjoining room.
They can see the Queen but cannot hear what is being said.
JAR JAR : Dissen all pitty odd to my.
ANAKIN : Don't look at me.
I don't know what's going on.
CAPTAIN PANAKA enters, then goes into the room with QUEEN AMIDALA.
PALPATINE is pacing as CAPTAIN PANAKA enters.
EIRTAE and RABE stand to one side.
PALPATINE : ...the Republic is not what it once was.
The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and their home sytems.
There is no interest in the common good...no civility, only politics...its disgusting.
I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.
AMIDALA : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
PALPATINE : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption.
A manufactured scandal surrounds him.
The bureaucrats are in charge now.
AMIDALA : What options do we have?
PALPATINE : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor.
One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces the laws, and give us justice.
You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
AMIDALA : He has been our strongest supporter.
Is there any other way?
PALPATINE : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts...
AMIDALA : There's no time for that.
The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate.
Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each day.
We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
PALPATINE : To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.
AMIDALA : There is something I cannot do.
A unique building with it tall spires stands out against the Coruscant skyline.
A small transport passes by the vast temple.
QUI-GON stands in a tall stately room.
Twelve JEDI sit in a semi-circle.
OBI-WAN stands behind QUI-GON in the center of the room.
The Senior Jedi is MACE WINDU.
To his left is an alien Jedi named KI-ADI-MUNDI, and to his right, the Jedi Master, YODA.
QUI-GON : ...my only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord.
MACE WINDU : A Sith Lord?!?
KI-ADI : Impossible!
The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.
YODA : The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
MACE WINDU : I do not believe they could have returned without us knowing.
YODA : Hard to see, the dark side is.
Discover who this assassin is, we must.
KI-ADI : I sense he will reveal himself again.
MACE WINDU : This attack was with purpose, that is clear, and I agree the Queen is the target.
YODA : With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon.
Protect her.
MACE WINDU : We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and discover the identity of your attacker...
May the Force be with you.
YODA : May the Force be with you.
OBI-WAN turns to leave, but QUI-GON continues to face the Council.
YODA : (Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
QUI-GON : With your permission, my Master.
I have encountered a vergence in the Force.
YODA : A vergence, you say?
MACE WINDU : Located around a person?
QUI-GON : A boy...
his cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life form.
It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.
MACE WINDU : You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring balance to the Force...you believe it's this boy??
QUI-GON : I don't pressume...
YODA : But you do!
Rrevealed your opinion is.
QUI-GON : I request the boy be tested.
The JEDI all look to one another.
They nod and turn back to OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON. YODA : Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
QUI-GON. QUI-GON : Finding him was the will of the Force...I have no doubt of that.
QUI-GON. There is too much happening here...
QUI-GON. MACE WINDU : Bring him before us, then.
QUI-GON. YODA : Tested he will be.
QUI-GON. GUARD : May I help you, son?
QUI-GON. ANAKIN : I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden, Padme.
QUI-GON. GUARD : The boy is here to see Padme.
QUI-GON. RABE : Send him in.
QUI-GON. ANAKIN : I'd like to speak with Padme, if I could.
QUI-GON. RABE : I'm sorry, Annie.
QUI-GON. Padme is not here right now.
QUI-GON. AMIDALA : (O.S.)
QUI-GON. Who is it?
QUI-GON. RABE : Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.
QUI-GON. AMIDALA : I've sent Padme on an errand.
QUI-GON. ANAKIN : I'm going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.
QUI-GON. ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I may not see her again...and...
QUI-GON. I just wanted to say goodbye.
QUI-GON. AMIDALA : We will tell her for you.
QUI-GON. We're sure her heart goes with you.
QUI-GON. ANAKIN : Thank you, Your Highness.
QUI-GON. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
The QUEEN dissapears behind the doorway, and ANAKIN exits.
A large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid the cityscape of Coruscant.
The Senate chambers are huge.
Thousands of SENATORS and their AIDES sit in the circular assembly area.
CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in the center.
Hindreds of AIDES and DROIDS hurry about.
SENATOR PALPATINE, QUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo congressional box, which is actually a floating platform.
PALPATINE leans over to the QUEEN.
PALPATINE : If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty, Ibeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.
AMIDALA : I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.
PALPATINE : You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I promise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...
Your Majesty, our only, chance.
AMIDALA : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion to a vote?
PALAPATINE : He is distracted...he is afraid.
He will be of no help.
VALORUM : The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.
The Naboo congressional box floats into the center.
PALPATINE : Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate.
A tragedy has occured on our peaceful system of Naboo.
We have become caugt in a dispute you're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the Trade Federation.
A second box rushes into the center of the Senate.
It is filled with Federation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.
LOTT DOD : This is outrageous!
I object to the Senator's statements!
VALORUM : The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade Federation at this time.
Please return to your station.
LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.
PALPATINE : To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.
QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly.
There is some applause.
AMIDALA : Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances.
The Naboo system has been invaded by force.
Invaded...against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the Trade...
LOTT DOD : I object!
There is no proof.
This is incredible.
We recommend a commision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.
VALORUM : Overruled.
LOTT DOD : Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without reasonable observation.
It's against all the rules of procedure.
A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room.
AKS MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.
AKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation.
A commision must be appointed...that is the law.
VALORUM : The point...
VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.
PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.
PALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add.
This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will dissapear.
VALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here.
Queen Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?
QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.
AMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now.
I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee.
If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed.
I move for a "vote of no confidence"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
VALORUM : What?...No!
This causes a great stir in the assembly.
A loud mumur cresendos into a roar of approval and jeers.
CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands speechless.
His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.
MAS AMEDDA : Order!
We shall have order...
Things settledown a little.
The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA.
PRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.
BAIL ORGANA : Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
MAD AMEDDA : The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.
MAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers something to him.
BAIL ORGANA : There must be no delays.
The motion is on the floor and must be voted upon in this session.
LOTT DOD : The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures committee for study.
The assembly begins to chant.
VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.
ASSEMBLY : Vote now!
Vote now!
Vote now!
PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.
PALPATINE : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...
MAS AMEDDA : Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess.
Tomorrow we will begin the vote.
The Federation delegation is furious.
VALORUM turns to PALPATINE.
VALORUM : Palpatine, I thought you were my ally...my friend.
You have betrayed me!
How could you do this?
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand outside the palace on a balcony.
OBI-WAN : The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master, and you know it.
He is far too old.
QUI-GON : Anakin will become A Jedi...I promise you.
OBI-WAN : Don't defy the Council, Master..not again.
QUI-GON : I will do what I must.
OBI-WAN : Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you would just follow the code.
They will not go along with you this time.
QUI-GON : You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.
ANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI.
MACE WINDU holds a small hand-held viewing screen.
In rapid succession, images flash across the screen.
ANAKIN : A ship...a cup...a speeder.
MACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA.
YODA : Good, good, young one.
How feel you?
ANAKIN : Cold, sir.
YODA : Afraid are you?
ANAKIN : No, sir.
MACE WINDU : Afraid to give up your life?
ANAKIN : I don't think so.
ANAKIN hesitates for a moment.
YODA : See through you, we can.
MACE WINDU : Be mindful of your feelings...
KI-ADI : YOur thoughts dwell on your mother.
ANAKIN : I miss her.
YODA : Afraid to lose her..I think.
ANAKIN : (a little angry) What's that got to do with anything?
YODA : Eveything.
Fear is the path to the dark side...
fear leads to anger...
anger leads to hate..
hate leads to suffering.
ANAKIN : (angrily) I am not afraid!
YODA : A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
I sense much fear in you.
ANAKIN : (quietly) I am not afraid.
YODA : Then continue, we will.
QUEEN AMIDALA is standing, staring out the window, with JAR JAR.
The lights of the city shimmer before them.
EIRTAE and SABE stand near the door.
JAR JAR turns to face the QUEEN and sees her sadness.
JAR JAR : Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?
AMIDALA : To motivate us, I imagine...
JAR JAR : Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?
AMIDALA : I don't know.
JAR JAR : Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?
AMIDALA : I hope not.
JAR JAR : Gungans do die'n without a fight....
wesa warriors.
Wesa gotta grand army.
Dat why you no liken us, metinks.
PALPATINE and CAPTAIN PANAKA rush into the rom and bow before the QUEEN.
CAPT.
PANAKA : Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.
PALPATINE : A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.
I promise, Your Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy back to the Republic.
I will put an end to corruption.
The Trade Fedreation will lose its influence over the bureaucrats, and our people will be freed.
AMIDALA : Who else can be nominated?
CAPT.
PANAKA : Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.
PALPATINE : I feel confident...our "situation" will create a strong sympaphy vote for us...
I will be Chancellor, I promise you.
AMIDALA : I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator, there will be nothing left of our cities, our people, our way of life...
PALPATINE : I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet.
The law is in their favor.
AMIDALA : With the Senate in transition, there is nothing more I can do here...Senator, this is your arena.
I feel I must return to mine.
I have decided to go back to Naboo.
My place is with my people.
PALPATINE : Go back!!
But, Your Majesty, be realistic!
You would be in danger.
They will force you to sign the treaty.
AMIDALA : I will sign no treaty, Senator.
My fate will be no different from that of our people.
Captain!
CAPT.
PANAKA : Yes, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Ready my ship!
CAPT.
PANAKA : Please, Your Majesty, stay here...where it's safe.
AMIDALA : No place is safe, if the Senate doesn't condemn this invasion.
It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions as a democracy.
If you win the election, Senator, I know you will do everything possible to stop the Federation.
I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the Senate.
AMIDALA and her RETINUE exit the room.
PALPATINE has a self-satisfied smile on his face.
ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON stand before the TWELVE MEMBERS OF THE JEDI
YODA : ...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
MACE WINDU : His cells contain a high concentration of midi-chlorians.
KI-ADI : The Force is strong with him.
QUI-GON : He's to be trained, then.
The COUNCIL MEMBERS look to one another.
MACE WINDU : No.
He will not be trained.
ANAKIN is crestfallen; tears begin to form in his eyes.
QUI-GON : No??!!
OBI-WAN smiles.
MACE WINDU : He is too old.
There is already too much anger in him.
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...you must see it.
YODA : Clouded, this boy's future is.
Masked by his youth.
QUI-GON : I will trin him, then.
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.
OBI-WAN reacts with surprise.
ANAKIN watches with interest.
YODA : An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon.
Impossible, to take on a second.
MACE WINDU : We forbid it.
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan is ready...
OBI-WAN : Iam ready to face the trials.
YODA : Ready so early, are you?
What know you of ready?
ANAKIN watches as QUI-GON and OBI-WAN exchange angry looks.
QUI-GON : Headstrong....and he has much to learn about the living Force, but he is capabe.
There is little more he will learn from me.
YODA : Our own council we will keep on who is ready.
More to learn, he has...
MACE WINDU : Now is not the time for this...the Senate is voting for a new Spreme Chancellor.
Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.
YODA : And draw out the Queen's attacker.
KI-ADI : Events are moving fast...too fast.
MACE WINDU : Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the dark warrior.
That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.
YODA : Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
QUI-GON : I brought Anakin here; he must stay in my charge.
He has nowhere else to go.
MACE WINDU : He is your ward, Qui-Gon...we will not dispute that.
YODA : Train him not.
Take him with you, but train him not!
MACE WINDU : Protect the Queen, but do not intercede if it comes to war until we have the Senate's approval.
YODA : May the Force be with you.
OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN leave.
QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN stand on the landing platform outside the ship.
ARTOO whistles a happy tune as he leans over the edge of the platform, watching the traffic.
Suddenly, he leans over too far and falls overboard.
After a moment, he reappears, using his on-board jets to propel himself back onto the landing platform.
The wind whips at ANAKIN as he listens to the JEDI.
OBI-WAN : It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.
QUI-GON : From your point of view....
OBI-WAN : The boy is dangerous...they all sense it.
Why can't you?
QUI-GON : His fate is uncertain, not dangerous.
The Council will decide Anakin's future...that should be enough for you.
Now get on board!
OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft followed by ARTOO.
QUI-GON goes over to ANAKIN.
ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem.
QUI-GON : You won't be, Annie....I'm not allowed to train you, so I want you to watch me and be mindful...always remember, your focus determines your reality.
Stay close to me and you will be safe.
ANAKIN : Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians?
QUI-GON : Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all living cells and communicates with the Force.
ANAKIN : They live inside of me?
QUI-GON : In your cells.
We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.
ANAKIN : Symbionts?
QUI-GON : Life forms living together for mutual advantage.
Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the Force.
They continually speak to you, telling you the will of the Force.
ANAKIN : They do??
QUI-GON : When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to you.
ANAKIN : I don't understand.
QUI-GON : With time and training, Annie...you will.
Two taxis pull up, and CAPTAIN PANAKA, SENATOR PALPATINE, TWENTY OR SO TROOPS, GUARDS, and OFFICERS walk briskly toward the ship, followed by QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTAE, and finally, JAR JAR.
AMIDALA and her HANDMAIDENS stop before the JEDI.
QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Your Highness, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you.
AMIDALA : I welcome your help.
Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means to destroy me.
QUI-GON : I promise you, I will not let that happen.
AMIDALA enters the ship, followed by her HANDMAIDENS.
JAR JAR hugs QUI-GON and ANAKIN.
JAR JAR : Wesa goen home!
They ALL move onto the ship.
The ship takes off.
INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.
INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT DARTH SIDIOUS : The Queen is on her way to you.
INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT I regret she is of no further use to us.
INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as they are.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT DARTH SIDIOUS fades off.
RUNE : A Sith lord here with us?!!
ANAKIN stands next to the PILOT, RIC OLIE, pointing to various buttons and gauges.
ANAKIN : ...and that one?
RIC OLIE : The forward stabalizer.
ANAKIN : And those control the pitch?
RIC OLIE : You catch on pretty quick.
SABE and EIRTAE stand behind QUEEN AMIDALA as she talks with QUI-GON and CAPTAIN PANAKA.
OBI-WAN and JAR JAR watch.
CAPT.
PANAKA : The moment we land the Federation will arrest you, and force you to sign the treaty.
QUI-GON : I agree...I'm not sure what you hope to accomplish by this.
AMIDALA : I'm going to take back what's ours.
CAPT.
PANAKA : There are only twelve of us, Your Highness....we have no army.
QUI-GON : I cannot fight a war for you, Your Highness, only protect you.
AMIDALA : Jar Jar Binks!
JAR JAR looks around, puzzled.
JAR JAR : Mesa, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Yes.
I need your help.
The Naboo Cruiser heads toward the lush green planet.
There is only one Federation battle cruiser orbiting.
OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA spot it on the view screen.
PANAKA : The blockade's gone.
OBI-WAN : The war's over...No need for it now.
RIC OLIE : I have one battleship on my scope.
OBI-WAN : A droid control ship.
PANAKA : They've probably spotted us.
OBI-WAN ; We haven't much time.
The QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TROOPS, and HANDMAIDENS get ready to disembark as the ship alnds.
The elevator door slides open, and ANAKIN emerges into the hold area.
He see PADME and run up to her.
ANAKIN : Hi!
Where have you been?
PADME : Annie!
What are you doing here?
ANAKIN : I'm with Qui-Gon...but...they're not going to let me be a Jedi.
I'm too old.
PADME : This is going to be dangerous, Annie.
ANAKIN : Is it?
I can help...
Where are we going?
PADME : To war, I'm afraid.
The Queen has had to make the most difficuld decision of her life.
She doesn't believe in fighting, Annie.
We are a peaceful people...
ANAKIN : I want to help...I'm glad you're back.
ANAKIN smiles.
PADME smiles back.

JAR JAR swims down into Bubble City.
INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE JAR JAR enters the main square of the bubble city.
INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE He stands, stunned, in amazement and fear.
INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE He is nervous and shaking.
INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE The plaza is empty.
INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE He notices that many of the buildings are shot up as if there had been a battle of some kind.
JAR JAR exits the swamp lake and walks over to QUEEN AMIDALA, CAPTAIN PANAKA, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON.
PADME, EIRTAE, RABE, ANAKIN, and ARTOO,
PILOTS, and EIGHT GUARDS stand in the background near the starship.
JAR JAR : Dare-sa nobody dare.
All gone.
Some kinda fight, I tink.
Sorry, no Gungas...no Gungas.

OBI-WAN : More likely they were wiped out.

CAPT.
TARPALS : Ouch time, Binks...
Ouch time for all-n youse.
EIRTAE, and the rest of her group are led through a clearing full of GUNGAN refugees.
At the far end are the ruins of a grand temple with massive carved heads.
BOSS NASS and several other COUNCIL MEMBERS walk out on the top of a three-quarter-submerged head.
BOSS NASS : Jar Jar, yousa payen dis time.
Who's da uss-en others??
QUEEN AMIDALA steps forward.
CAPTAIN PANAKA and the JEDI stand behind her.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HALF A DOZEN GUARDS and PILOTS look around nervously, and the GUNGAN TROOPS lower their long power poles.
The JEDI stay relaxed.
ANAKIN watches everything with great interest.
AMIDALA : We wish to form an alliance...
Suddenly, PADME steps forward.
PADME : Your Honor...
ARTOO whistles a quiet "uh oh."
BOSS NASS : Whosa dis?
PADME : I am Queen Amidala (points to Queen) This is my decoy...my protection...my loyal bodyguard.
ANAKIN is stunned.
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look.
PADME : (Cont'd) ...I am sorry for my deception, but under the circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself.
Although we do not always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in peace...until now.
The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build.
You are in hiding, my people are in camps.
If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever...I ask you to help us...no, I beg you to help us.
PADME drops to her knees and prostrates herself before BOSS NASS.
There is a gasp from CAPTAIN PANAKA, HIS TROOPS, and the HANDMAIDENS.
PADME : (Cont'd) We are your humble servants...our fate is in your hands.
Slowly, CAPTAIN PANAKA and his TROOPS bow down before the GUNGAN COUNCIL.
Then the HANDMAIDENS, ANAKIN, and finally the JEDI.
The GUNGANS are puzzled by this.
BOSS NASS begins to laugh.
BOSS NASS : Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans..
Mesa like dis.
Maybe wesa bein friends.
NUTE, RUNE, and DARTH MAUL walk with a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.
NUTE : ...we've sent out patrols.
We've already located their starship in the swamp....It won't be long, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : This is an unexpected move for her.
It's too aggresive..
Lord Maul, be mindful.
DARTH MAUL : Yes, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Be patient...
Let them make the first move.
A GUNGAN SENTRY sits on top of the ancient temple heah, searching the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars.
He sees something and yells down to ANAKIN at the foot of the statue.
GUNGAN LOOKOUT : Daza comen!
ANAKIN : All right.
They're here!
ANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are discussing a battle plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS.
SABE and EIRTAE stand nearby.
BOSS NASS puts his arm around JAR JAR.
BOSS NASS : Yousa doen grand.
Jar Jar bringen da Naboo together.
JAR JAR : Oh, no, no, no...
BOSS NASS : So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.
JAR JAR : General??!
Oh, no..
JAR JAR's eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints.
FOUR SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP.
CAPTAIN PANAKA and a DOZEN OR SO
and PILOT pile out and join the group.
PADME : What is the situation?
CAPT.
PANAKA : Almost everyone's in camps.
A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground movement.
I brought as many of the keaders as I could.
The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much stronger.
Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
PADME : The battle is a diversion.
The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away from the cities.
We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side.
Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Pnaka will create a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.
Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.
PADME : (Cont'd) What do you think, Master Jedi?
QUI-GON : The Viceroy will be well guarded.
CAPT.
PANAKA : The difficulty's getting into the throne room.
Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem.
QUI-GON : There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be killed.
BOSS NASS : Wesa ready to do are-sa part.
JAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin.
ANAKIN watches with interest, as does ARTOO.
PADME : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army.
We will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting the planet.
If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication and their droids will be helpless.
QUI-GON : A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.
The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.
OBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger.
If the Vicroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army.
PADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy.
Everything depends on it.
NUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS walk through the throne room.
DARTH SIDIOUS : ...she is more foolish than I thought.
NUTE : We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers assembling near the swamp.
It appears to be made up of primitives.
We do not expect much resistance.
OOM-9 : I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.
DARTH MAUL : I feel there is more to this, My Master.
The two Jedi may be using the Queen for their own purposes.
DARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved.
They can only protect the Queen.
Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant....
This will work to our advantage...
NUTE : I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Proceed.
Wipe them put...all of them.
INT.
NABOO SWAMP LAKE
All is peaceful.
SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp lake.
Suddenly there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake.
A rush of bubbles, then a GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the water, followed by SEVERAL OTHERS.
FROGS and OTHER LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN ARMY marches through the swamp.
The KAADU shake themselves off as they exit the lake.
When JAR JAR's KAADU shakes off, JAR JAR falls off.
SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield generators mounted on their backs follow the marching WARRIORS.
The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of the swamp and onto the rolling grassy hills.
HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in lon lines toward the horizon.
Federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop.
In the distance they see the GUNGAN ARMY marching toward them.
The GUNGAN GENERAL CEEL sees the tanks on the ridge and orders a halt.
The GUNGANS are spread out in a large line.
JAR JAR is nervous.
GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield operators.
GENERAL CEEL : Energize the shields.
A red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on the back of a second FAAMBA and spreads like an umbrella over the assembled

The Federation tanks begin to fire on the GUNGANS, but they are protected by their energy shield.
The tanks stop firing, and the GUNGANS CHEER, until they see the doors to the massive transports open, and racks of BATTLE DROIDS are pulled out and lined up by a squad of STAPS.
The BATTLE DROIDS reconfigure into their standing position.
The GUNGANS get ready for an attack.
OOM-9 gives the command to move forward, and THOUSANDS OF DROIDS march toward the GUNGANS.
The GUNGANS power up their weapons.
The DROIDS slowly march through the protective shield and start firing.
The GUNGANS throw their power poles and fling small balls of energy with slingshots.
The WARRIORS dump large balls of energy into mortars that heat up and fire the energy goo onto the BATTLE DROIDS, causing them to short out.
The battle rages and the GUNGANS defend their shield generators against the ARMY OF DROIDS.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY PADME, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON join forces with
PADME : My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.
She looks to QUI-GON.
QUI-GON : I agree.
They start to head for the exit, on the way passing the fighter where ANAKIN is hiding.
ARTOO whistles a greeting as ANAKIN peeps out of the cockpit.
ANAKIN : Hey!
Wait for me.
QUI-GON : No, Annie, you stay there.
Stay right where you are.
ANAKNI : But, I...
QUI-GON : Stay in that cockpit.
They head for the exit.
As they are about to go through the door, suddenly everyone scatters, revealing DARTH MAUL standing in the doorway.
CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS back away.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN step forward.
QUI-GON : (Cont'd) We'' handle this...
The TWO JEDI take off their capes and ignite their laser swords.
DARTH MAUL takes off his cape, and ignites his laser sword.
Both ends of the sword light up.
At the far end of the hanger, SIX WHEEL DROIDS roll in and transform into their battle position.
ARTOO calls ANAKIN's attention to the DROIDS.
The JEDI begin to fight the Sith Lord.
ANAKIN : Oh, no...
The DROIDS begin to advance and start firing on PADME and HER TROOPS.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We gotta do something, Artoo.
ARTOO whistles a reply.
Suddenly, the ship's systems go on, and the ship begins to levitate.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right, thanks Artoo!
Great idea!
I'll take over.
Let's see...
ANAKIN steers the ship toward the DROIDS.
He pushes a button, and the ship begins to shake.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Where's the trigger?
Oops, wrong one..
Maybe this one....
ANAKIN pushes a second button, and the lasers begin to fire, wiping out several DESTROYER DROIDS.
ARTOO whistles a cheer.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yeah, all right.
"Droid blaster."
Yeah!
The JEDI are engaged in a fierce sword fight with DARTH MAUL.
They have moved into the center of the hanger.
While the WHEEL DROIDS are momentarily distracted by ANAKIN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS exit into a palace hallway.
The WHEEL DROIDS start firing at ANAKIN.
There are EXPLOSIONS all around him.

GENERAL CEEL : Retreat!
Retreat!
The GUNGANS begin to turn and run, on foot, on their kaadu, and in wagons.

A ship explodes behind him (over his left shoulder).
ANAKIN : Whoo, boy!
This is tense!
He looks forward to see enemy ships approaching head on.
ANAKN : (Cont'd) : Oops!
Artoo, get us off Autopilot!
ARTOO screams a reply.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I've got control?
ANAKIN fips switches.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Okay, let's go left!
He moves the controls left and the ship responds, turning left.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yes...I've got control.
You did it, Artoo!
ARTOO beeps
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Go back!?!
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and that's what I'm gonna do.
Now c'mon!
An enemy fighter comes into his sights.
ANAKIN pushes the controls and instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past the enemy ship.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops!
Whoa!
Now the enemy ship is on his tail.
He tries evasive maneauvers.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.
ANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're in trouble!
Hang on!
The way out of this mess is the way we got into it.
ARTOO beeps a reply.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Which one?

The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway filled with a series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that shoots down the corridor every minute or so.
DARTH MAUL makes it down several walls of deadly rays before they close.
QUI-GON is one wall away from the DARK LORD.
OBI-WAN is just starting into it and is five walls way from
The JEDI must wait until the next pulse to advance down the corridor.
OBI-WAN is impatient and paces, waiting for the wall of rays to open.
QUI-GON sits and meditates.
The SITH LORD tries to patch up his wounds.
A window in the hallway blasts apart.
PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and HER SOLDIERS climb into the hallway.
They head for the door to the throne roo.
Suddenly, two DESTROYER DROIDS skitter in front of the door.

The electric rays cycle as QUI-GON sits meditating.
The wall of the deadly rays turn away, and OBI-WAN starts running toward QUI-GON and the DARK LORD.
When the wall between QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL opens, QUI-GON is in a split second fighting the DARK LORD with a ferocity not seen before.
They move into the area at the end of the corridor called the melting pit, a small area that is mostly made up of a deep hole.
The electron ray gates begin to close.
OBI-WAN tries to make it to the melting pit but is caught one gate short.
He slides to a stop just before he hits the deadly electron field.
QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a frustrated OBI-WAN watches.
DARTH MAUL cathces QUI-GON off guard.
The SITH makes a quick move, bashes his lightsaber handle into QUI-GON's chin, and runs him through.

NUTE : Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness.
Time for you to sign the treaty...and end this pointless debate in the Senate.
SADBE dressed like the Queen appears in the doorway with SEVERAL TROOPS.
Several destroyed battle droids can be seen in the distance.
SABE : I will not be signing any treaty, Viceroy, because you've lost!
NUTE and THE OTHERS are stunned to see a SECOND QUEEN.
NUTE yells at the TEN GUARDS in the room.
NUTE : After her!
This one is a decoy!
SIX OF THE DROIDS rush out of the throne room after SABE.
NUTE turns to
NUTE : (Cont'd) Your Queen will not get away with this.

She takes a third pistol and BLASTS the last of the BATTLE DROIDS.
The OFFICERS rush to the door control panel as PADME hits the switch to close the door.
The OFFICER at the door jams the controls.
CAPTAIN PANAKA throws more pistols to the OTHER GUARDS.
The NEIMODIANS are confused and afraid.
PADME : Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here.
NUTE : Don't be absurd.
There are too few of you.
It won't be long before hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us.
OBI-WAN screams as the pulsing electron gate opens, and the SITH LORD attacks him.
The DARK LORD is relentless in his assault on the young JEDI.
OBI-WAN and DARTH MAUL use the Force to fling objects at each other as they fight.
DARTH MAUL seems to have the upper hand as OBI-WAN grows weary.
DARTH MAUL catches OBI-WAN off guard, and the JEDI slips into a melting pit.
He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit.
DARTH MAUL grin evilly at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN's lightsaber down the endless shaft.
The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill.
At the last moment, OBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON's lightsaber to hi, throwing DARTH MAUL off.
The young JEDI swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH down.
DARTH MAUL falls into the melting pit to his death.
OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is dying.
OBI-WAN : Master!
Master!
QUI-GON : It is too late...It's...
OBI-WAN : No!
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan promise...promise me you'll train the boy...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...he will...bring balance...train him!
QUI-GON dies.
OBI-WAN cradles his Master, quietly weeping.
ANAKIN peeks over the edge of the cockpit to see BATTLE DROIDS surrounding the ship.
He ducks back down.
ANAKIN : Uh oh.
This is not good.
He looks at the dashboard to see red lights.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) The systems are still overheated, Artoo.
The BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN walks up to the ship and sees ARTOO.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : Where's your pilot?
ARTOO beeps a reply.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) You're the pilot?
ARTOO whistles.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) Let me see your identification!
ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green.
ANAKIN : Yes...we have ignition.
He flips the switch and the engine starts.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (seeing Anakin) You!
Come out of there or we'll blast you!
ANAKIN : Not if I can help it!
Shields up!
ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN.
The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the lasers are deflected by ANAKIN's shields.
ARTOO beeeps.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) This should stop them.
ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) ...and take this!
He presses a button and launches two torpedos which miss the DROIDS.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Darn...I missed!
The two torpedos fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Let's get out of here!
ANAKIN's ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over the DROIDS.
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Now, this is Podracing!
Whoopee!

The sun streams into the multi-windowed room at a low angle.
It is not quite sunset.
YODA paces before OBI-WAN, who is kneeling in the center of the room.
YODA : Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does.
But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
OBI-WAN : Qui-Gon believed in him.
I believe in Qui-Gon.
YODA : The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.
OBI-WAN : Master Yoda, Igave Qui-Gon my word.
I will train Anakin.
Without the approval of the Council if I must.
YODA : Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.
Need that, you do not.
Agree, the council does.
Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be.

OBI-WAN. YODA : Always two there are....no more...no less.
OBI-WAN. A maste and an apprentice.
