MOTION -- flat out -- it's us -- we're running -- stumbling -- breathing rushed -- blood in the snow...
We are JASON BOURNE and we're running down an alley...
Supered below: MOSCOW
BLUE LIGHTS -- from the distance -- strobing through the night -- rushing toward us -- POLICE CARS -- three of them - - SIRENS HOWLING as they bear down -- closer -- faster -- until they whip past the alley...
Up against the wall -- BOURNE is hidden in the shadows.
BOURNE is badly wounded -- shot through the shoulder -- bruises and broken bones from the final car chase in
With a GROAN, he lifts himself up, staggers across a park toward a PHARMACY...
ROWS of MEDICINE and FIRST AID supplies, and in the background, a DOOR being jimmied...It's BOURNE...The ALARM goes off...
VICODIN, as BOURNE grabs it...Then PENICILLIN...
Then SURGICAL SUPPLIES:
Scalpel...Forceps...Sutures...Cotton gauze...Betadine...
BOURNE finds a large sink...Rests his gun there...Lays out SURGICAL SUPPLIES...Checks out his back in the mirror...Opens the capsules of penicillin and pours the powder directly into the wound...Begins treating himself...
A POLICE CAR pulls up to the curb, lights flashing.
One POLICEMAN goes to the jimmied DOOR.
SECOND POLICEMAN sees blood and footprints.
He motions to his partner to follow...
BOURNE finishing up -- splashes water on his face -- he seems a man on a mission.
He looks up --
A MIRROR. His face...
"415" written on a building.
DISEMBODIED VOICE (HIRSCH) Welcome to the program...
DISEMBODIED VOICE (HIRSCH) POV Bourne walks down a corridor (corridor #1).
The cops approaching.
Daniels leading Bourne down the corridor.
DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.) You'll be saving American lives.
A black sack is thrown over Bourne's head, then:
(STOCK) A torrent of quick shots of Bourne's kills: the Professor, Jarda, the blonde guy in Paris, Mr. And Mrs.
Neski...
And finally.
BANG -- Marie hit in the head.
The car off the bridge.
She sinks away dead...
The POLICE enter the back room, guns drawn.
POLICEMAN #1 Put your hands on your head and turn around slowly!
POLICEMAN #1 BOURNE snaps out of it, doesn't move.
POLICEMAN #1 POLICEMAN #1 (older) approaches him.
POLICEMAN #1 When BOURNE doesn't respond to his questions, the POLICEMAN starts forward.
POLICEMAN #1 BOURNE turns and in one motion grabs his gun from the sink and disables the
POLICEMAN. BOURNE freezes POLICEMAN #2 with his gun and a look.
BOURNE Give me your gun and radio.
BOURNE POLICEMAN #2's gun and radio skittle across the floor.
BOURNE My argument is not with you.
BOURNE smashes the radio and takes the gun.
BOURNE exits...
A TITLE fades in --
SUPER: Six Weeks Later
Establishing shot -- CIA Headquarters
A workman installs a nameplate that reads: Ezra Kramer, Director, CIA.
Kramer listens to a recording with Landy and Cronin.
There are unhung pictures and a few other items that indicate he has just moved into this job.
Two other senior CIA officials sit in on the meeting.
Kramer looks at a file on Bourne and Abbott.
BOURNE (V.O.) So we got in the way?
BOURNE (V.O.) Is that why Neski died?
BOURNE (V.O.) Is that why you killed Marie?
Kramer glances at a photo of Marie in the file.
ABBOTT (V.O.) You killed Marie the minute you climbed into her car.
ABBOTT (V.O.) The minute you entered her life she was dead!
Kramer looks at Abbott's official photo.
BOURNE (V.O.) I told you people to leave me alone!
BOURNE (V.O.) I fell off the grid.
BOURNE (V.O.) I was half way around the world.
ABBOTT (V.O.) There's no place it won't catch up to you.
ABBOTT (V.O.) It's how every story ends.
ABBOTT (V.O.) It's what you are, Jason.
ABBOTT (V.O.) A killer!
ABBOTT (V.O.) You always will be.
CRONIN We think that's Bourne hitting him on the head and then--
He makes a gun with his hand, i.e.
Bourne putting his gun to Abbott's head.
ABBOTT (V.O.) Go ahead!
ABBOTT (V.O.) Go on!
ABBOTT (V.O.) Do it!
BOURNE (V.O.) She wouldn't want me to.
BOURNE (V.O.) That's the only reason your alive.
The tape clicks off.
KRAMER Who's "she?"
CRONIN puts a picture of MARIE in front of KRAMER.
LANDY His girlfriend, Marie.
LANDY She was killed in India three weeks ago.
Kramer looks down at another image.
Abbott dead after his suicide.
KRAMER A dirty section chief in league with a corrupt Russian Billionaire commits suicide when confronted by Jason Bourne.
KRAMER You couldn't make this stuff up.
KRAMER You watched this happen?
Landy nods.
Kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole situation.
KRAMER Bourne's last confirmed location is Moscow, three days ago?
LANDY Right.
KRAMER So what does he do now?
LANDY I think he's looking for something he hasn't found.
KRAMER Like what?
KRAMER What's he after?
LANDY I'm not sure.
LANDY Maybe he hasn't gotten his memory back yet.
LANDY Not all of it.
A look from Kramer...
KRAMER Pam, what I need to know is, what kind of a threat is he to us?
LANDY If he just wanted to hurt us he could have sent this tape to CNN.
KRAMER Maybe he still will.
KRAMER Maybe he gave it to you because he wants to throw you in the opposite direction of his real plan.
KRAMER I don't know.
KRAMER I just know my number one rule is "the only way to stay safe is to assume the worst."
KRAMER As far as I'm concerned Bourne is a serious threat until proven otherwise.
ROSS interviews DANIELS, a TAPE RECORDER on the table between them.
ROSS shows DANIELS some of the evidence he's assembled...WANTED POSTERS of JASON BOURNE.
ROSS ...This one's three years ago -- had half of Interpol after him -- disappeared...Turned up in Naples -- Berlin -- Moscow -- disappeared again...
ROSS The girl he was on he run with -- Marie Kreutz -- she turned up dead halfway around the world, from a sniper's bullet...
ROSS What connects the dots?
ROSS Is it Treadstone?
DANIELS Turn off that tape recorder.
The charm of old Paris captured in the workings of an elevator operating in a wrought-iron shaft...
A WORK TABLE, covered with sheet music, music paper, pencils.
And, sitting on the upright piano against the wall, a framed PHOTO of MARIE...
A KNOCK on a door beautifully, heavily lacquered with centuries of paint...
MARTIN KREUTZ, late 20s, opens the door and finds BOURNE.
A long look between them -- like two lost brothers who recognize each other -- each has been waiting for this moment for a long time.
Martin looks out the window.
MARTIN Where is my sister?
BOURNE She's dead.
BOURNE She was killed.
MARTIN I knew it was going to end this way.
MARTIN It was always going to end this way...
BOURNE I didn't believe that.
MARTIN Why did she die?
BOURNE She was shot.
BOURNE A man came for me.
MARTIN And then you killed him.
Bourne nods.
MARTIN Now what?
BOURNE Someone started all this...and I'm going to find them.
Bourne looks at him for a beat and leaves.
Bourne climbs the stairs.
Bourne rounds a corner and stops, sees a bodyguard at a door up the street hail a car then go back inside.
Bourne walks up to the door, the bodyguard comes out again.
Bourne knocks him aside.
Grabs the man behind him,
BOURNE Who started Treadstone?
The bodyguard comes back, gun out--
ELLATRACHE It's OK!
ELLATRACHE They're still looking for you.
ELLATRACHE You are taking a big risk coming here.
Bourne shoves him against the wall, hard.
BOURNE Just tell me what I want to know!
ELLATRACHE I just provided them weapons.
ELLATRACHE I don't know who started--
BOURNE You know something.
BOURNE Tell me where to start looking.
ELLATRACHE There's a journalist in London.
ELLATRACHE Simon Ross.
ELLATRACHE He seems to know a lot about you.
ELLATRACHE He has a source inside the program.
ELLATRACHE Someone there from the beginning.
ELLATRACHE What should I tell them if they contact me?
BOURNE They give me the name I want, or I burn their entire house down to get it.
ROSS hurries to catch a TAXI as he talks on his cell phone.
ROSS ...This is big -- a skein of lies -- you pull at it and it just keeps coming -- I'll fill you in when I get home.
ROSS And it's not finished, either.
ROSS They're calling it `Blackbriar'.
ROSS Follow this SEQUENCE as...
A LISTENING STATION in England scoops up MILLIONS of CELL PHONE CALLS...Sifts through BILLIONS of words...One word EMERGES from the CHATTER...
BLACKBRIAR A TECHNICIAN sends the data to NSA back in the States...Where another COMPUTER gathers up the rest of the phone call...As we listen...
TECH#3 "Blackbriar" echelon hit.
TECH#3 NSA, please confirm receipt.
And there in the CRI HUB, another TECHNICIAN receives the DATA.
Stops SUPERVISOR and reports.
TECHNICIAN #1 Sir, we intercepted a call from London, keyword "Blackbriar."
SUPERVISOR Okay, send it to CRI right now.
NOAH VOSEN, deft and confident, arrives at CRI Headquarters.
As VOSEN steps out of the elevator and into his office, he is met by his #2, WILLS.
WILLS We tracked the phone.
WILLS Registered to a London reporter named Simon Ross.
WILLS He works at the Guardian newspaper.
10 They enter a hallway through double doors towards the HUB.
VOSEN You tracking him?
VOSEN As they pass through, colleague hands WILLS a file.
WILLS Yeah, thanks Mike.
WILLS We have a survey team covering him at work...and a sneak and peek's on their way to his apartment.
VOSEN Well, who talked to him?
VOSEN How did he find out about Blackbriar?
WILLS We don't know, we pulled his background and ran a cross check on any known anomalies, but we've come up with nothing.
WILLS But, I think if we follow Ross, we are going to be able...
VOSEN Right.
VOSEN Ross is easy.
VOSEN I want the source.
VOSEN They enter the HUB.
BOURNE buys a newspaper, enters the station and gets on the
VOSEN and WILLIS listen to the phone call.
ROSS (VOICEOVER) Have you heard of an Operation Blackbriar?
ROSS (VOICEOVER) I'm going to try and get my head around this, see you first thing.
ROSS (VOICEOVER) VOSEN turns.
VOSEN Is that all?
WILLS Yeah.
VOSEN I want rendition protocols and I want the asset put on standby, just in case.
VOSEN steps out from DATA ROOM...addresses the HUB.
VOSEN People, listen up, this is a full priority situation
WILLS Jimmy, give me Ross's profile on one.
WILLS ROSS'S information come up on the center screen.
VOSEN Our target is a British national, Simon Ross, a reporter.
VOSEN I want all his phones, his blackberry, his apartment, his car, bank accounts, credit cards, travel patterns...I want to know what he's going to think before he does.
VOSEN Every dirty little secret he has.
VOSEN And most of all, we want the name and real time location of his source.
VOSEN This is NSA priority level 4, any questions?
VOSEN No response from the HUB.
VOSEN (CONT'D) All right, let's get to it.
The EUROSTAR winds it's way to London.
BOURNE reads The Guardian.
He sees an article written by Simon Ross.
Title: "RENEGADE ASSASSIN LOSE IN EUROPE".
It mentions BOURNE.
There is a photo of Marie--
12 Marie smiles at him.
12 Marie shot.
12 Marie fades into the depths, dead.
12 Bourne burns Marie's stuff
BOURNE comes out of the flashback.
He is still carrying the pain of her loss
Bourne finds Ross's name on the masthead, then goes to the name just below it in the news department.
Ross crosses a busy London street -- heads to Guardian office building.
A CRI TEAM watches from a parked car.
TECH #1 watches the data arrive.
TECH#1 Copy that.
TECH#1 Mr. Vosen, subject is entering his office.
TECH#1 VOSEN watches the feed.

TECH#2 HUB chatter about ROSS phone.
TECH#3 Take an hour to get his phone...
VOSEN That's too long.
VOSEN Off VOSEN.
ROSS reports to his EDITOR.
EDITOR So how do we know he's not spinning for someone?
ROSS There's more.
ROSS He was scared.
EDITOR Scared of what?
ROSS Blackbriar.
ROSS A REPORTER sticks her head in.

REPORTER Won't give hie name.
REPORTER ROSS leaves to pick up the call.
ROSS crosses the busy newsroom...
REPORTER He's on my line...
REPORTER ROSS picks up the phone.
REPORTER Ross (CONT'D) Simon Ross.
VOSEN watches as ROSS takes phone call.
VOSEN Why aren't we hearing this?
WILLS That's a hard line, Jimmy, why don't we have it?
JIMMY We have his line, sir, but he's not on it.
JIMMY WILLS looks confused.
ROSS listens.
BOURNE (V.O.) Waterloo Station, south entrance, thirty minutes.
ROSS Who is this?
BOURNE (V.O.) This is Jason Bourne.
Bourne You want to talk to me.
Come alone.
BOURNE hangs up.
ROSS looks bewildered -- hangs up the phone -- gathers his stuff -- puts his notebook in his pocket and leaves.
SURVEY ONE (V.O.) Are you getting an image?
Where's he going?
WILLS Okay, he is on the move.
WILLS Target is mobile.
WILLS The HUB reacts.
WILLS Okay, people, look sharp, give me eyeballs on the street.

MOBILE 2 We have the subject confirmed.
VOSEN Where is he heading?
MOBILE 2 Waterloo Station.
BOURNE arrives on the EUROSTAR.
Enters the station.
As the taxi moves away, the SILVER VAN pulls out behind it.
A CYCLE COURIER momentarily blocks its path.
Looking in on ROSS sifting through documents in the back seat.
HUB (V.O.) Stand by at Waterloo...
BOURNE moving toward the rendezvous...
ROSS pays the DRIVER, exits.
Checks his watch.
Looks around.
Isn't sure what his next move is--
TECHNICIANS searching for ROSS on the busy street.
TECHNICIAN #2 Mobile One -- give us eyes on the subject.
MOBILE ONE-- two people from the van-- take up a position in an open stairwell three floors up.
They focus a camera down on Ross.
BOURNE buys a cell phone.
Activates the SIM card on the new phone.
Dumps the pay-as-you-go package in a bin.
Rounds a corner.
Out of sight.
Screens come alive with a POV of ROSS.

MOBILE ONE up the stair well and MOBILE TWO at street level.
Commuters coming up the escalators.
BOURNE joins them - moving towards Ross.
Closer.
Right on him.
ROSS oblivious.
Looking out onto the street.
BOURNE brushes past him and PUTS THE PHONE IN HIS POCKET..
ROSS feels the contact.
Checking himself -- he's okay.
But now a phone is ringing -- looks around, must be someone else.
But the vibration's coming from his jacket pocket.
ROSS takes out the phone -- not his -- puzzled.
ROSS hits "answer."
ROSS Hello?
BOURNE Don't ask questions.
BOURNE Just listen...
VOSEN watching...
VOSEN What's he doing?
VOSEN I thought we blocked his cell?
VOSEN Who the hell is he talking to???

VOSEN I want options.
VOSEN Wills keys in a CODE...
PAZ, 20s, cool and predatory, drives and waits for instructions...His PHONE buzzes...He reads the code...Accelerates toward Waterloo Station...

To the right -- a young man in a hooded top -- speaking on his cell -- walking toward a BUS STOP...
A plan is forming.

VOSEN It doesn't matter, the asset now has 2 targets.
VOSEN Take them both out.
VOSEN WILLS taps in the order...
PAZ moves cross a narrow walkway.
28 Now he's behind a mechanical 'tri-panel' hoarding.
28 The kind that displays a different advert every 15 seconds.
28 He waits for the change and then---
28 -- A huge field of vision across the concourse stretching out down below him- a sniper's heaven.
28 PAZ pulling open the motor-casing from the side panel, goes to work on it.
28 Slowing the rotation.
28 Rearranging the large triangular prisms to give him just the right time-gap to pull the trigger- and just enough cover to disappear.
28 He takes out rifle parts from his rucksack.
28 Starts to assemble them.
BOURNE I'm going to get you to safety but you have to stay calm do exactly what I say.

BOURNE (INTO PHONE No.
BOURNE (INTO PHONE Something's not right.
Paz awaiting his shot--
SCOPE POV The door comes open slightly, but from this angle Paz doesn't have a clean shot at his target (who he thinks is Bourne).
Bourne searches the rafters, looking for any threats from above.
ROSS (TEL. V.O.) I'm going to go for it, okay?
BOURNE Don't move until I tell you.
BOURNE Bourne is distracted by the last of the agents disappearing.
BOURNE Something is definitely wrong--
ROSS I'm going to go for it.
BOURNE No, No not now.
BOURNE Ross suddenly sprints out from behind the door--
Paz sees the shape emerge--
PAZ fires--
But it's Ross, not Bourne.
Ross is hit by Paz's shot.
He falls, inches from the silver door, dead.
Blood has splattered on the door.
Paz snaps his head back to the scope, realizing he's shot the wrong person.
Then he catches a glimpse of Bourne--
Bourne ducks behind the gathering crowd, out of Paz's line of sight, and goes to the body.
Vosen and Wills stare at the screen.
At the image of Ross, dead on the concourse.
The room -- normally full of chatter has gone dead silent...
Vosen puts his head in his hands.
This is a monumental screw up and everyone here knows it.
He just had the wrong man killed....
VOSEN Oh...shit...
Then suddenly Vosen snaps back to focus:
VOSEN (CONT'D) Get the asset out of there ...
WILLS What about Bourne?
WILLS On the HUB MONITORS we see Police moving in...
WILLS Vosen doesn't need to see anymore.
VOSEN Get him out of there - NOW!
Bourne feels Ross' body for something.
Paz is frustrated by the order.
He's itching to get another shot off at Bourne, but after a beat, packs up quickly, as ordered.
Back in Waterloo, Cops run in from all sides.
On the screens and in real life, the aftermath of the hit.
PARAMEDICS try helplessly to deal with ROSS -- killed instantly by the head shot meant for BOURNE...POLICE arrive and seal off the crime scene...
BOURNE on the move.
Fast --
Past platforms.
On his way up to the Tri Panel.
Up stairs.
On to a walkway.
To his right he sees a figure disappearing...
PAZ. BOURNE hammers down the walk - way in pursuit.
BOURNE tailing PAZ down on to a parallel platform.
PAZ dipping down into the underground entrance.
PAZ moving deliberately through the evening rush hour-- blending in...
BOURNE in pursuit.
Chasing on instinct.
There...A glimpse of PAZ at the bottom of an escalator.
BOURNE fights past people.
PAZ disappears into the crowd.
BOURNE rushes to catch him.
Rounding a corner...
A long walkway -- at the end, two staircases lead to different tube lines.
BOURNE hesitates-- measures the choice.
The sound of a train fills the station--
BOURNE -- Fast downstairs.
Watches-- just as PAZ gets onto the car at another door.
BOURNE lunges to get on the train...But the doors close...
BOURNE'S POV Watching PAZ from the platform as he SAGS down onto a seat, nauseated, his skin clammy, his head pounding...He takes out the PILLS and dry-swallows them...Looks up...
CLOSE ON -- BOURNE Watching PAZ...As if he's looking in the MIRROR at his old self...The self before THE BOURNE IDENTITY...
CLOSE ON -- PAZ He looks straight ahead, just another commuter...
BACK ON -- BOURNE Watching PAZ, as the train pulls away...Then BOURNE is immediately in motion...
KRAMER Hello.
VOSEN It's Vosen.
VOSEN We have a situation.
Establishing Sewell and Marbury.
DANIELS watches news of ROSS murder on TV.
DANIELS panics, opens his safe, packs up papers, takes Blackbriar FILE.
Sets alarm.
Leaves.
BOURNE sits at a computer, the ROSS notebook open in front of him.
He pages through it, finding names, places, "HOW DID THIS ALL START?" -- and Blackbriar.
He Googles "Sewell and Marbury"-- finds Paris, Berlin, Madrid.
BOURNE continues to search and finds receipt from Madrid.
BOURNE leaves.
LANDY steps out of a TAXI...
Vosen's sitting.
VOSEN Sparkling.
VOSEN And a "Heart-Healthy" omelet with goat cheese and peppers.
VOSEN Landy arrives.
VOSEN You're late.
VOSEN Traffic?
WAITER Ma'am?
LANDY Nothing for me.
Vosen looks at her, surprised.
VOSEN I'm buying.
She shakes her head, no.
She sits, without taking her coat off.
She's not staying long.
VOSEN When the Director called, it was suggested we bring you on--
LANDY Suggested?
LANDY Are you sure it was just a suggestion?
VOSEN Funny how different things look depending on where you sit.
VOSEN I look at this as doing a favor for you.
VOSEN Giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished business.
LANDY Meaning?
VOSEN Jason Bourne.
LANDY Bourne's finished.
VOSEN Really?
LANDY It was finished the moment I realized I was chasing him for something he didn't do.
LANDY The case is closed.
VOSEN So what do you make of this?
VOSEN French intel picked up Bourne meeting Pierre Elattrache on Tuesday.
VOSEN He threatened to burn our house down if you didn't tell him who started Treadstone.
VOSEN That's a big problem, wouldn't you agree?
LANDY This doesn't feel like Bourne to me.
VOSEN Why's it so hard for you to believe?
LANDY Probably because it's coming from you, Noah.
VOSEN Lets try and be adults okay?
VOSEN We all thought he was done, off the grid.
VOSEN But Bourne's back.
VOSEN Maybe he's a threat.
VOSEN We both want the same thing here.
LANDY So what happened at Waterloo?
VOSEN We have a leak.
VOSEN Bourne showed up in our surveillance.
VOSEN We had very little time to react.
LANDY And the reporter ended up dead?
VOSEN Bourne saw us coming.
Landy looks at him, suspicious.
LANDY So what was he doing?
VOSEN? We don't know.
VOSEN? But just the fact that he was there means he's up to something, don't you think?
VOSEN? Maybe he's the source?
LANDY The real question is how you managed to get in a fire fight in the middle of a public train station.
VOSEN Don't second guess an operation from an armchair, Pam.
VOSEN It's not fair.
LANDY I'm going to the office now.
LANDY I'll make my own introductions.
LANDY Off VOSEN...
AN AVE train pulling into the vast station.
BOURNE stepping out, walking up the platform.
Moving out through the station...
TWO NEW TECHS plus the three we met before.
All watching VOSEN lead LANDY and CRONIN into the room.
WILLS This is Pamela Landy.
WILLS She's gonna be quarterbacking our search effort.
WILLS I think what we oughta do, just to get started, let's go around the room, say who you are and what your spec is.
WILLS LANDY stepping in before this gets going --
LANDY Let's do names later.
LANDY What's Bourne's last fixed position?
LANDY Anybody.
TECH#3 London.
TECH#3 Twelve hundred Zulu.
LANDY Status?
LANDY Wounded?
LANDY Armed?
TECH#2 Alive.
TECH#2 Mobile.
TECH#2 Unknown.
LANDY Where are your grids coming from?
TECH#1 NSA Tactical.
LANDY You have an Echelon package?
TECH#1 Yes.
LANDY Why isn't it on?
TECH#1 We were waiting.
LANDY For what?
LANDY You're nine hours behind the toughest target you've ever tracked.
LANDY I want everyone to sit down, strap in, and turn on all you've got.
LANDY That would mean now.
LANDY That lights it.
LANDY They're moving.
LANDY (CONT'D) Thank you.
LANDY (CONT'D) VOSEN watches...
LANDY (CONT'D) I want everything you've got on Ross on screen one.
LANDY (CONT'D) LANDY watches as the screen lights up with ROSS information...
Bourne arrives, begins to recon the area.
He goes to the front door finds "Sewell and Marbury" and rings the bell.
No answer.
Two cops come around a corner.
Bourne sees them, notes the side of the building and leaves.
TECH#1 Sir, we just hacked Ross's email account at the Guardian and found a round trip ticket to Turin, yesterday.
TECH#1 0800 arrival, 12:05 departure.
LANDY I think we can be pretty certain that Bourne's not your source then?
VOSEN How?
LANDY Ross's call to his editor, where he said he just met the source on Blackbriar, took place just after his flight landed.
LANDY His met his source in Turin.
VOSEN So?
LANDY So, what, Bourne met Ross for breakfast and then, at noon the same day Bourne calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo?
CRONIN Maybe they were even on the same flight?
VOSEN Cross check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with Blackbriar SCI clearance against all calls in and out of Turin during the morning Ross was there
VOSEN TECHNICIANS start pounding keyboards.
LANDY The guy you're after is a CIA operative with clearance above Top Secret.
LANDY He was committing treason by talking to Ross.
LANDY Do you really think, while doing that, he used a cell phone he knows we can track?
TECH 3 (JIMMY) Zero results on the cross check.
VOSEN stares daggers at her.
WILLS Do you have a better idea?
LANDY Yeah, I'd look at all the people whose cell phones were switched off the entire period Ross was in Turin.
WILLS Do it Jimmy.
TECHNICIANS start tapping.
LANDY I mean if your people use their cell phones as much as mine do, the list should be pretty small
TECHNICIAN 3 JIMMY Three names: Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin, Neal Daniels.
The names display on the screen: Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin Neal Daniels.
The HUB employees can't help but be impressed by LANDY.
WILLS and VOSEN notice their response.
LANDY Now check everything in Ross's apartment against those names.
LANDY Look for common patterns, look for -
CRONIN Initials .....Bring that up on main.
LANDY turns.
CRONIN is leaning down in front of a computer screen.
Point to something for the tech --- who puts it on the big screen, blown up.
In a set of handwritten notes by ROSS it says "per N.D."
next to several scrawls.
LANDY Neal Daniels.
LANDY He's Station Chief in Madrid now, isn't he?
WILLS Jesus Christ.
VOSEN Call the RSO at the Embassy and have them take Daniels into custody if he's there.
VOSEN If he's not, get a grab team to the Calle Norte safe house.
VOSEN Send them in heavy and tell them we'll assist with entry.
LANDY "Heavy?" Daniels isn't--
VOSEN I'm worried about Bourne.
VOSEN If he's not Ross's source, then he must be after Ross's source -- just like us.
VOSEN Off LANDY...
BOURNE in a TAXI turning a corner into a narrow street.
The rain has slowed, but the streets are still quiet.
BOURNE gets out and walks past the SEWELL and MARBURY front door, picks the lock and gains entry.
BOURNE up the stairs.
Finds the office.
Jimmies the door.
Disables the alarm.
All the signs of a hurried exit.
A half filled cup of coffee -- cigarette burned down in an ashtray but not snubbed out -- a light left on -- files and documents, some shredded, some not.
Vosen paces back and forth.
The hub is MUCH quieter than it was in the Waterloo scenes.
TECH 1. (LUCY) Parque Vasquez is clean.
TECH 1. (LUCY) No sign of subject.
VOSEN Team two, ETA Callee Norte?
FILTERED V.O. (KILEY) Three minutes.
A BLACK CAR moving briskly through traffic and --
HAMMOND at the wheel.
KILEY with the map.
Shutting off his phone.
BOURNE checks the office.
Soon he finds a photo of Daniels with Albert Hirsch.
Bourne arrives at a nondescript steel door with two CCTV cameras covering it.
He sees 415 written above the door.
The flashback overwhelms Bourne.
POV shots of Bourne walking down the long corridor with Daniels.
Other shots revealing that Bourne is in Army dress greens (without hat).
Daniels knocks and leads Bourne into-
Bourne is driven to his knees.
Bourne is dragged into a room with a large water tank.
His hands have been bound behind his back, the sack's drawstring pulled tight, and he has been weighted down.
Bourne is shoved into the water.
Bourne falls into the water.
SPLASH.
He starts to sink.
The wet sack allows us to see the outlines of his face.
Also POVs as Bourne sinks.
Bourne struggles wildly at first.
Tries to get out of his restraints.
But to no avail.
SRD men watch him from the edge of the tank.
Perhaps also on monitors.
Expressionless.
Bourne fights every human instinct to draw a breath.
Also shot from Bourne's POV:
HIRSCH (FILTERED, EERIE) You're going to drown.
HIRSCH (FILTERED, EERIE) There is nothing you can do to prevent this.
HIRSCH (FILTERED, EERIE) Stop struggling and accept it.
HIRSCH (FILTERED, EERIE) Finally Bourne can't hold his breath for an instant longer.
HIRSCH (FILTERED, EERIE) His mouth opens.
HIRSCH (FILTERED, EERIE) Water rushes in.
HIRSCH (FILTERED, EERIE) He convulses, begins to drown...
Bourne's body goes limp.
SRD men watch.
No reaction.
Bourne goes limp.
POV of him blacking out.
BOURNE comes out of the FLASHBACK.
As he staggers across the room, he notices a car arriving on the monitor...
A car approaches.
Bourne snaps out of it and sees the car on a security monitor.
Agents get out of car and approach building.
TECH#3 Sir, they're at the front door.
TECH#3 VOSEN watches...
HAMMOND AND KILEY enter the building.
BOURNE runs water into the TEA KETTLE -- sets the trap...
HAMMOND and KILEY enter.
HAMMOND We're in.
HAMMOND BOURNE listens from his hiding spot.
LANDY paces.
VOSEN Okay, put it live.
HAMMOND moves quickly into the room -- gun raised.
HAMMOND at the alarm box.
HAMMOND Alarm's down.
VOSEN That has to be Bourne.
VOSEN VOSEN already moving to the monitor.
HAMMOND and KILEY -- move cautiously from room to room -- they've done it before...
HAMMOND Safe's cleaned out.
VOSEN pacing impatiently around the speakerphone --
VOSEN Shit...
VOSEN Track the passports.
KILEY gestures to a light moving under a door.
Kiley crouching...leaning in...hand on the knob, and --
Pulls the closet DOOR OPEN --
Nothing.
Sink, dishes.
a small kitchen.
And...
on the stove...a tea kettle and a spoon...
Which is the last thing they'll remember, because...
BOURNE -- coming around the corner fast -- full stop and --
BOURNE lays out HAMMOND...
KILEY turns to find BOURNE -- who takes him out too.
Then it stops.
BOURNE yanks the headsets.
Closes the PHONE.
The SCREENS go black.
Silence...
VOSEN Goddamn it!
VOSEN Get a back-up team in there!
TEA KETTLE payoff...
VOSEN How long till back-up arrives?
VOSEN The hub scrambles to answer that...
VOSEN Landy paces in the background.
VOSEN Suspicious of Vosen...
VOSEN How long?
VOSEN Stop!
VOSEN Hang on.
VOSEN I have an idea...
ON A SECURITY MONITOR -- BOURNE sees another figure moving up the stairs...Checking his watch, reloading his gun.
Twisting into the path to shoot as the door opens, hesitating because-
It's NICKY.
A beat -- long unbroken.
BOURNE What are you doing here?
NICKY I was posted here after Berlin.
BOURNE Where's Daniels?
BOURNE The office PHONE goes.
BOURNE Bourne waving her to it.
BOURNE She picks it up.
BOURNE He hits the speaker phone.
NICKY (V.O.) Hello.
VOSEN Who is this?
NICKY (V.O.) This is Nicky Parsons.
NICKY (V.O.) Who's this?
NICKY (V.O.) Landy reacts to her voice...
NICKY (V.O.) Both Vosen and Landy strongly suspect Bourne is there and listening...
NICKY (V.O.) Vosen reads her "Duress Challenge" identity check off the
screen.
It reads:
Challenge: "Sparrow"
Response if Under Duress: "Ruby"
Response if Normal: "Everest"
VOSEN Nicky, I need to do an ID
challenge first.
Code in: "Sparrow."
Vosen looks at the screen to check her response...
NICKY Response: "Everest".
VOSEN Nicky, this is Noah Vosen.
VOSEN How long have you been on site?
NICKY (V.O.) I just walked in.
VOSEN We have two officers on site.
VOSEN Are you in contact with them?
NICKY (V.O.) They're down.
NICKY (V.O.) Unconscious, but alive.
VOSEN Is there any sign of Daniels?
NICKY (V.O.) No.
LANDY Nicky, this is Pam Landy.
LANDY We have reason to believe there is a connection between Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne.
NICKY (V.O.) Bourne, are you still looking for Bourne?
NICKY (V.O.) I thought the case was closed.
LANDY No, some people are convinced he's still a threat.
LANDY I disagree but to find out I need to talk to him.
VOSEN seething because LANDY has interrupted him...
VOSEN Hold on Nicky.
Vosen hits the mute button.
VOSEN What are you doing?
VOSEN You know Bourne's probably listening.
Landy doesn't answer.
Vosen to Wills:
VOSEN How long till back up arrives.
VOSEN Wills holds up three fingers.
VOSEN Vosen unmutes.
VOSEN (CONT'D) Listen, Nicky.
VOSEN (CONT'D) I want you to stay put and secure the premises.
VOSEN (CONT'D) It could be an hour until another team arrives.
VOSEN (CONT'D) LANDY piercing VOSEN with a look...
BOURNE continues to hold the gun in her face -- NICKY is very calm considering the predicament she is in.
NICKY Okay.
NICKY DIAL TONE as the line gets closed at the other end.
NICKY They know you're here.
BOURNE How long do I have?
NICKY Three minutes...
FLASH: TWO SEDANS squeal around a corner.
CRI reinforcements.
DELTA DUDE 2 minutes to safehouse.
NICKY My car's outside.
NICKY I know where Daniels is.
NICKY BOURNE lowers his gun, grabs the phone and dials "1-1-2"
SPANISH OPERATOR (SUBTITLE) Emergency operator.
SPANISH OPERATOR (SUBTITLE) Where is your emergency?
SPANISH OPERATOR (SUBTITLE) BOURNE answers her in perfect Spanish with a perfect Madrid accent, but worked up, like a civilian would be...
BOURNE (SUBTITLE) 334 Calle Norte.
BOURNE (SUBTITLE) I hear gunfire.
BOURNE (SUBTITLE) And men shouting.
BOURNE (SUBTITLE) I think they're Americans --
BOURNE (SUBTITLE) BOURNE pushes the phone off the desk -- fires four shots into the ceiling -- calmly moves Nicky towards the back door...
VOSEN You "disagree" he's a threat?
VOSEN He just took out two more of my men.
VOSEN Not to mention his ultimatum to Ellatrache?
LANDY The only way this has a happy ending, Noah, is if we find a way to bring Bourne in voluntarily.
VOSEN He wants revenge, Pam.
VOSEN The only realistic way to deal with this is to eliminate the threat.
BOURNE and NICKY rapidly descend.
BOURNE Okay, where is Daniels headed?
NICKY 8 o'clock this morning, he wired $100,000.
NICKY to a numbered bank account in Tangier.
BOURNE Okay, Tangier is about 300 miles away, we can make the morning ferry.
NICKY And then what?
Bourne and Nicky exit on to the street.
Suddenly they hear tires squealing nearby.
NICKY They're coming.
NICKY They continue to walk down the street towards Nicky's car.
Vosen and Landy are watching this live.
As they cross the street two MADRID POLICE CARS come around the corner the wrong way and screech to a stop.
Vosen reacts...
Four cops jump out and take aim at the AGENTS.
SPANISH POLICE Manos Arriba!
SPANISH POLICE Manos Arriba!
SPANISH POLICE More sirens closing in.
SPANISH POLICE A third police car appears.
SPANISH POLICE Then a fourth...
Vosen can't believe it--
The agents drop their guns and surrender.
BOURNE and NICKY continue around a corner -- they get in her VW GOLF and drive away...
Vosen stares at Landy.
A beat, then she walks out.
VOSEN Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne, effective immediately.
VOSEN on the phone.
VOSEN We lost Bourne.
KRAMER You still think he's after Daniels?
VOSEN Yeah.
VOSEN Nicky's just the means.
VOSEN But if we find Daniels, we'll find Bourne.
KRAMER Daniels knows way too much.
KRAMER Daniels knows everything.
KRAMER We can't let them meet.
VOSEN I'll take care of it.
KRAMER Good.
KRAMER And fill Hirsch in.
KRAMER Just in case.
BOURNE and NICKY sit over coffee.
A long silence...then:
NICKY What are you after, Jason?
NICKY Why are you looking for Daniels?
BOURNE Do you know who this is?
BOURNE Bourne puts the photo of Daniels and Hirsch on the table between them.
BOURNE She looks at the photo, points.
NICKY That's Daniels.
NICKY I don't know who that is.
BOURNE I have to get back to the beginning...or I'll never be free of this.
NICKY Who is he?
BOURNE I think he started Treadstone.
BOURNE I remember meeting him.
BOURNE I remember the first day...
BOURNE Daniels brought me to him.
BOURNE Nicky looks back at him....not sure what to say.
NICKY What happened?
BOURNE An initiation...I guess...
QUICK FLASH: Bourne, head in sack, is held underwater, struggling desperately for breath--
Bourne comes out of the flashback.
Nicky is looking at him....
NICKY Jason...that wasn't some one-off initiation.
NICKY Daniels said they did that to you over and over again.
NICKY That's how they...
NICKY She doesn't finish.
NICKY And Bourne doesn't ask her to.
NICKY Just a long pause.
BOURNE Why are you helping me?
NICKY It was difficult for me...with you.
NICKY BOURNE looks up.
NICKY Another long pause...
NICKY (CONT'D) You really don't remember anything?
BOURNE No.
BOURNE NICKY'S face.
BOURNE Two SPANISH COPS enter the cafe.
BOURNE (CONT'D) We should move.
52 They get up and leave...
Vosen goes to his safe.
VOSEN Noah Vosen.
VOSEN Then he puts his thumb into a print reader.
VOSEN The safe door pops open.
VOSEN He pulls out a file marked "Top Secret."
CRONIN makes his way down the hallway.
LANDY works at her desk.
CRONIN enters...
CRONIN They tracked Daniels' passport to a hotel in Tangier.
CRONIN They're holding up a bank transfer he made to keep him in place while they move an asset in from Casablanca.
CRONIN Off LANDY.
CRONIN This just keeps getting worse...
Landy enters without knocking.
LANDY Since when do you have authorization for lethal action against Daniels?
VOSEN Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar safe and fled to Morocco!
LANDY So grab him--
VOSEN I don't have the people on the ground to do that and I'm not going to risk that file falling into the wrong hands.
LANDY What's going on?
LANDY What's Daniels got?
VOSEN What's he got?
VOSEN He ran all of Blackbriar's operations in Southern Europe and North Africa.
LANDY I think the world's well aware we have a rendition and lethal action capability at this point, Noah.
VOSEN For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got our entire playbook.
VOSEN Names, dates, ghost sites, how we train our assets.....
LANDY You still don't have the authority to kill him.
VOSEN Oh, yes I do, Pam.
VOSEN Vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe.
VOSEN It is labeled "Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol."
VOSEN That's what makes us special.
VOSEN No red tape.
VOSEN No more getting badguys in our sights and then watching them escape while we wait for some bureaucrat to issue the order.
VOSEN Landy opens up the file.
VOSEN Sees the words "instantaneous lethal action is authorized when..."
LANDY You just decide?
LANDY No oversight.
LANDY No checks and balances.
VOSEN Come on, Pam, you've seen the raw intel.
VOSEN You know how real the threat is.
VOSEN We can't afford to have our hands tied like that anymore.
BOURNE and NICKY ride the ferry from Gibraltar to Morocco...
They arrive and pass through CUSTOMS...
DANIELS drives...

The phone buzzes.
Kramer picks it up.
ASSISTANT (PHONE V.O.) It's Pam Landy.
ASSISTANT (PHONE V.O.) She says it's urgent.
ASSISTANT (PHONE V.O.) On Kramer...the wheels turning....
KRAMER Tell her I'm unreachable.
KRAMER Kramer hangs up.

The wheels turning in her head....
She hangs up.
A pensive moment, then she gets up and heads for--

TECH (LUCY) Stationery at Place de France.
VOSEN That's where Parson's is.
VOSEN He pauses, deciding what course to take.
VOSEN Landy watches.
VOSEN When we're finished with Daniels send the asset after her.
VOSEN We find Parsons, we find Bourne.
LANDY (OVERLAPPING) Noah, what are you doing?
VOSEN Not now.
LANDY Now.
LANDY I want to know what's going on.
VOSEN Not now.
LANDY I'm asking on what basis you're continuing this operation.
VOSEN On the basis that Nicky Parsons has compromised a covert operation.
VOSEN She is up to her neck in it.
LANDY This is about Daniels, not Nicky!
VOSEN She has betrayed us!
LANDY You don't know the circumstances!
VOSEN She's in league with Jason Bourne for Chrissake!
LANDY You don't have the authority to kill her or Bourne!
VOSEN Yes, I do Pam, it's right here and it's legal.
VOSEN slams a document on the desk.

DANIELS answers phone.
BANK OFFICER (FRENCH, SUBTITLED) Mr. Daniels, Bank of Tangier.
BANK OFFICER (FRENCH, SUBTITLED) Your funds are now available.
BANK OFFICER (FRENCH, SUBTITLED) Daniels leaves.
DESH parks the motorbike and walks around the corner, BOURNE follows.
DANIELS' car coming down the street.
BOURNE stops and sees the car -- realizes the danger.
BOURNE turns back to see DESH with the detonator in his hand.
BOURNE locks eyes with DESH.
Before BOURNE can react -- DESH detonates.
BOOM!
DANIELS is DEAD.
BOURNE is thrown across the street by the blast.
He lays
DESH POV.
He looks back to see BOURNE not moving, lying in the street.
DESH gets on his motorbike and heads off to kill NICKY.
NICKY still at that cafe waiting.
Taking out her phone- * puzzled.
She answers.
Looking around.
NICKY * Code in?
NICKY * * (no reply) * Code in?
Nothing.
Just the noise of traffic.
DESH on the move towards Petit Socco.
On the cell - making * that 'silent call'.
BOURNE'S too late- hearing the 'line busy' tone.
Knows this * tactic.
And those POLICEMEN are getting closer.
Frenzied teching.
A screen comes alive.
TECHY * We have a trace.
TECHY 2 * Target heading north.
TECHY 2 * Rue des * Chretiens.
TECHY 2 * Intercept ETA six * minutes.
VOSEN * Okay, that's it.
VOSEN * Bar her cell.
VOSEN * * Tie it off.
DESH is disappearing from view.
And the POLICEMEN are surrounding BOURNE.
Demanding to see * his papers.
BOURNE speaking in Spanish - fishing for his papers.
* Looking back up the street.
Forming a plan.
Checking his * watch.
More POLICE arriving now.
And DESH has disappeared out of sight.
No time for this.
BOURNE breaks away.
Through the crowds into the traffic.
* Police whistles- shouting.
Confusion.
The chase is on.
Three policemen turning into his path.
No choice.
BOURNE * taking them down.
Sprinting out across the road.
A KID and his moped.
Caught up in the police dragnet.
* BOURNE leaping on the bike - kick-starting it.
Away into traffic as two squad cars turn and make chase.
BOURNE weaving through traffic.
One hand on the bike the * other on the cell, desperately trying to call NICKY.
But now, at least he's got a dial tone.
NICKY grabbing the cell.
Answering.
NICKY * Bourne?
BOURNE * Nicky?
BOURNE * Listen to me.
BOURNE * You need * to - *
The line goes dead.
Looking at the screen - 'SERVICE *
Really spooked now- looking around.
Time to move.
Dismantling the phone instinctively - scattering it's * components.
She starts to make her way out of the square.
DESH through the streets-getting closer - heading towards * the PETIT SOCCO.
BOURNE picking up the pace.
Three more police cars out of a * side road just missing him.
BOURNE choosing his exit.
Up ahead- a narrow alleyway - taking it.
The squad cars crunching to a halt, behind him.
DESH crossing the SQUARE weaving through a sea of push * bikes.
Parking his Vespa at the corner of RUE DES CHRETIENS.
Travelling on foot.
NICKY - trying to keep calm.
Checking each alley.
Moving * on.
BOURNE arriving - seeing NICKY has left.
Seeing DESH'S * Vespa parked up.
More police - on foot now.
BOURNE parking up.
Seeing the crowded streets.
Looking up * to the rooftops.
He needs to get higher.
Starts running up steps.
BOURNE into a riad.
Through a courtyard - up more stairs - * up a ladder.
Out onto the rooftops.
Scanning the skyline.
* A beat.
Has he misjudged?
No, there in the distance at the top of a narrow street- * NICKY walking slowly and behind DESH.
Moving quickly.
BOURNE tailing him - trying to close the gap.
Dipping down * through another riad - through an alley.
Up more stairs.
* Back up onto another roof.
He's gained a few metres on *
Desh goes up to the rooftops now.
Bourne has him in sight - * DESH is prepping his gun with a silencer.
DESH speeding up.
BOURNE sees NICKY down below amongst the * crowds.
In Desh's sights.
BOURNE knows he has to gain more ground.
CABLE CAM shot - Two trained assassins leaping across the * narrow streets - silently effortlessly -- the cops down * below searching the alleyways, oblivious to the chase * unfolding above them.
BOURNE nearly on terms with him - then -- *
DESH dipping down again into the street below.
Avoiding * the police -- he melts into the crowds.
STEADYCAM SHOT - following BOURNE as he heads downstairs.
* More stairs.
Through a corridor then a courtyard - * bursting out of a door into the street - *
A police checkpoint.
Right in his path.
Bourne forced to * dog leg and take another route.
BOURNE'S lost him- for the moment.
NICKY - walking fast up the Rue des Chretiens.
Wondering * why there are so many police around.
Suddenly stopping - seeing DESH - knows instantly that he * is coming for her.
Now we see NICKY'S skills.
Has to think on her fee t- *
Checking the alleyways.
Slipping out of sight.
NICKY looking to the rooftops -- taking the advantage.
Up * some steps -- into a riad.
Desh tracking her.
BOURNE seeing Desh again - further up the street.
Heading * in that direction.
NICKY through one hallway - then another.
Moving up all * the time.
DESH arriving at the steps.
Looks up to where Nicky is * going.
Takes the entrance to the next building.
* Anticipates her next move.
Aiming to cut her off.
NICKY up steps.
Out onto the rooftops.
Looking for a path * across them.
Scrabbling across the roof of this crumbling riad.
Knows * she can't go back down.
She makes it across to the next building.
Where Desh is...
BOURNE up high.
Seeing NICKY on that other roof.
He can't get across to her.
Moving fast now.
Down steps.
Into the riad courtyard.
BOURNE entering the hallway.
Moving up the stairs.
Towards Nicky.
And towards Desh.
Meanwhile NICKY moving down.
Looking out into the * courtyard below.
The sound of POLICE getting nearer.
BOURNE hearing the POLICE too as he moves up onto a * landing.
BOURNE into a main room - something stirring on a couch - a * girl and her little sister having a siesta.
In another room two small boys fast asleep.
TV playing.
* One wakes.
A noise on the stairs above.
Quickly arranging a mirror - * getting line of sight - Bourne dipping into a corner.
It's NICKY.
She gives him a look -- DESH is in here somewhere.
The door goes below them.
The noise of Police entering the * Riad.
NICKY signalling to BOURNE - this way.
They climb narrow stairs to the next floor.
Down below Police begin searching rooms.
Waking the * sleeping family.
Shouting, crying.
Commotion.
BOURNE and NICKY creeping up the steps.
Then - suddenly NICKY spinning round as two silenced * bullets speed past her - And DESH bursting out of a landing * toilet.
On to Bourne.
Full on Treadstone fighting in the narrow stairwell.
Crashing into a tiny disused lift cage- silent constrained- * vicious.
Downstairs a young POLICEMAN hears the noise- heading for * the lift.
NICKY seeing the handle turn.
Thinking quickly.
She sends * the lift up to the next floor.
The POLICEMAN stepping back from the door -- directing the * other cops out to the courtyard.
People are spilling out into the atrium.
It's pandemonium.
Bourne and Desh spill out of the elevator and onto the * roof.
BOURNE kicking the gun - spinning across the floor - he and * DESH facing each other.
DESH with BOURNE - straight over the edge.
DESH still on top - just.
A brutal exchange.
Matching each other's moves like * shadows.
Relentless.
Rolling - falling onto another roof level.
And another.
67 The two men tiring now.
67 DESH grabbing for the bag.
67 The * pills.
67 BOURNE kicking them away.
67 BOURNE has the upper hand now.
67 DESH'S reaction's slowing.
67 * No longer the match he was.
67 BOURNE drags him to the ground.
67 He's finished.
67 Bourne's * won.
67 DESH- shivering -- convulsing.
67 In the struggle, BOURNE strangles Desh.
194 BOURNE and NICKY hide DESH's body.
194
BOURNE Alright, we need to be dead.
BOURNE You need to code that in.
BOURNE NICKY CODES into DESH'S PDA -- BOTH OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED...In the CRI HUB the message comes up...VOSEN and LANDY believe NICKY and BOURNE are both DEAD...
The code from DESH remains on screen -- BOTH OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED -- like an EPITAPH for BOURNE and NICKY...VOSEN packs his briefcase.
Turns to WILLS.
VOSEN I want to be sure.
VOSEN Have the station chief in Rabat confirm the deaths and do a sub-rosa check...And keep and eye on Landy.
VOSEN Off WILLS...
Cronin enters.
CRONIN The hub just got word Bourne and Nicky are dead.
CRONIN Landy looks at him.
LANDY Confirmed?
CRONIN Not yet.
CRONIN Landy looks away...thinking.
CRONIN Wheels turning.
LANDY Get me a copy of Bourne's personnel file.
Bourne and Nicky enter.
BOURNE scrubs the blood from his hands.
REVEAL Nicky watching him from the bedroom.
Landy sits at her desk reviewing files on Treadstone.
Open on her desk we see the file she will be looking at in the Supremacy phone call.
The way she examines the papers we get the sense she thinks something is missing, some piece, some file.
Bourne scrubbing the blood from his hands.
Nicky comes in, touches his shoulder.
There's a tenderness to it, a re- assurance.
For a moment it looks like Bourne might react...but the moment passes....
Landy opens a new file.
Bourne's operations.
Bourne is toweling off.
BOURNE I can see all their faces.
BOURNE But I can't remember any names....
Landy looks at Bourne's kills.
The faces Bourne remembers.
But there names are here, and who they were, why they were killed.
Bourne and Nicky sitting together.
BOURNE I was starting to remember who they were...in India...with Marie.
BOURNE A beat.
NICKY It's just going to lead to more killing, Jason.
NICKY Are you sure you want that?
NICKY Bourne takes her words in.
NICKY But who he is is eating him alive from the inside...
BOURNE I've killed people and I've tried to apologize for what I've done, for what I am.
BOURNE None of it makes it better...
Another moment passes between them...then:
BOURNE They're going to come for you again.
BOURNE You are going to have to run now.
BOURNE She gets up.
Nicky dies her hair BLACK.
Starts cutting it shorter.
Bourne walks with a now dark-haired Nicky.
They exchange looks for a long beat.
She turns towards the bus.
BOURNE It gets easier.
Landy finds a denotation in Bourne's file that he was "recruited to Treadstone by Neal Daniels."
Further down the page it says "Bourne was inducted into Treadstone at the Special Research Department facility at 415 E 71st, New York, NY."
Then "Facility closed by order of Director, June 2002."
Bourne looks at the tattered remains of Daniels' body and belongings.
70 He goes through his briefcase and finds a nearly destroyed piece of paper with "Noah Vosen - Director of Operations - CRI" written on it.
70 Bourne slips the morgue attendant a bribe.
Vosen is shaving.
WILLS Station chief in Rabat just called, they found a body.
WILLS Bourne?
VOSEN Desh.
On final approach to JFK.
Bourne looks out the window to see the Verizano Narrows bridge.
And beyond it, Manhattan.
Bourne is coming home.
Establishes skyline.
CRONIN Pam, You need to see this.
CRONIN Landy follows CRONIN into--
BOURNE'S PASSPORT is displayed on the computer monitor.
CRONIN (CONT'D) This passport just cleared Immigration at JFK ten minutes ago.
CRONIN (CONT'D) It's an early Treadstone identity registered to Jason Bourne but he never used it and it never went to the grid.
CRONIN (CONT'D) Bourne's alive.
LANDY They don't know.
CRONIN No, if they knew Vosen wouldn't be in his office right now.
Bourne moves through the airport.
LANDY It's a hell of a risk.
CRONIN Yeah.
CRONIN Maybe Bourne wants us to know, just like Naples, maybe he's communicating.
CRONIN Maybe he's trying to communicate with you.
LANDY Maybe we should communicate back.
LANDY Because I think I know what Bourne's looking for.
Bourne over the 59th Street Bridge -- arrives at CRI -- goes into the adjacent building --
Bourne uses his monocular to zoom in on a file Vosen is looking at -- he sees the word "Blackbriar."
Vosen puts the file back in the safe.
LANDY'S cell phone rings.
She answers it.
LANDY Pamela Landy.
BOURNE I hear you're still looking for me.
LANDY puts down her pencil.
CRONIN watches.
LANDY Bourne?
His phone rings.
He picks it up.
WILLS (TEL. V.O.) Get in here!
WILLS (TEL. V.O.) Bourne called Landy!
WILLS (TEL. V.O.) Vosen jumps up, sprints toward the hub--
LANDY I guess I owe you an apology.
Vosen rushes in--
BOURNE (V.O.) Is that official?
VOSEN (OVERLAPPING) Are we triangulating?!
LANDY (V.O.) No.
LANDY (V.O.) Off the record.
LANDY (V.O.) You know how it is.
BACK ROOM TECH (OVERLAPPING) Trying--
BOURNE (V.O.) Good-bye.
LANDY Wait.
LANDY Wait.
LANDY She opens a file on her desk.
Bourne listening--
LANDY David Webb.
LANDY That's your real name.
VOSEN Why the hell did she give him that?
LANDY (V.O.) You were born 4/15/71 in Nixa, Missouri.
LANDY Why don't you come in, and we'll talk about it?
LANDY Bourne?
BOURNE Get some rest, Pam.
BOURNE (V.O.) You look tired.
BOURNE (V.O.) Vosen realizes--
VOSEN He's got line of sight on us!
She spins to look for Bourne--
Vosen moving across the floor.
VOSEN ...This is a national security emergency.
VOSEN We have an imminent threat.
Landy takes out her gun.
Checks it.
VOSEN Jason Bourne is alive and at large in New York City.
VOSEN We believe in one thousand yards of this building.
VOSEN I want an immediate twelve block lockdown of the area.
VOSEN Send a FLASH message to Langley, prep for local backup assistance.
HIGH ANGLE: Landy leaves CRI.
Wills walks over to Vosen.
The look in his eye indicates that he thinks there's something odd about this:
WILLS Landy just left the building.
WILLS Vosen looks at Wills....
WILLS A beat, Vosen's suspicion building, though he can't quite put his finger on what he suspects...
VOSEN Check Landy's phone.
VOSEN Is she using it?
Landy receives a text message.
Vosen leans in to the Hub's back monitoring room.
VOSEN Nothing?
VOSEN No calls since Bourne--
BACK ROOM TECH Wait a minute.
BACK ROOM TECH Wait.
BACK ROOM TECH She just got a text.
Landy heads for someplace -- now with purpose.
VOSEN confers with WILLS.
VOSEN What the hell do you mean we can't read it?
TECH Working on it--
VOSEN How do you know a text came if you can't read it--
VOSEN Are we on Landy?
TECH Six men.
TECH More on the way.
VOSEN I want that goddamn text.
VOSEN We need to get out in front of her!
TECH Seconds...
TECH VOSEN paces anxiously.
TECH (CONT'D) Got it!
TECH (CONT'D) TECH points at big screen: "Tudor City Pl & 42nd.
TECH (CONT'D) Ten minutes.
TECH (CONT'D) Come alone.
TECH (CONT'D) Come on foot."
VOSEN Surround it.
VOSEN Anyone not on Landy goes to Tudor City.
VOSEN Now!
VOSEN Get the trucks.
VOSEN We're going mobile.
LANDY walks east toward Tudor City.
She looks around her for any signs of surveillance but finds nothing out of the ordinary.
Vosen and AGENTS come running out of the front door.
Others leave through a side entrance.
They jump in sedans.
Landy still being trailed by foot.
Vosen and agents race to Tudor city.
An electronic map on the dash.
AGENT 3 Copy, we're going to take a left at 41st.
AGENT 3 One block, settle at the corner.
VOSEN Get the map up.
AGENT 4 It's a bad place to pick, it's too exposed.
VOSEN He wouldn't have chosen it if he didn't have a reason.
LANDY walks east through the crowded streets.
BOURNE walks down the street, enters a building.
Spotter on a rooftop.
LANDY is on the east side now, walking toward Tudor City.
An agents trails her on foot.
Another parallels her from across the street.
SERIES OF SHOTS: CRI cars arrive, careful to stay several blocks from the meet site.
They jump out and try to set up surreptitious surveillance posts.
AGENT 3 (V.O.) Okay folks here we go, box at two hundred meters.
AGENT 3 (V.O.) Let's lock it down.
Bourne climbs stairs.
Landy walks, agents are everywhere looking for her.
Vosen is still in car.
VOSEN As soon as you have eyes on Landy, I want to know.
She becomes clear to AGENT 3.
AGENT 3 Okay, here we go.
Bourne climbs stairs.
Walks down a dank hallway.
VOSEN Copy that, I see her.
VOSEN Landy stands on a corner waiting for Bourne.
VOSEN (CONT'D) Any sign of Bourne?
TIGHT SHOT on Bourne's face.
FAST TILT to TIGHT ON his hands, pulling up what seems like a piece of clear tape.
We can't tell where we are or what he's doing.
Landy looks around.
TIGHT ON Bourne's hands placing the clear tape on a piece of clear plastic.
Again we can't tell what's going on.
Agents watch Landy.
Vosen's cell phone rings.
VOSEN Noah Vosen.
BOURNE (V.O.) This is Jason Bourne.
BOURNE (V.O.) VOSEN reels for a beat.
BOURNE (V.O.) Then quickly scans the streets, trying to see if he can spot BOURNE.
VOSEN How did you get this number?
BOURNE (V.O.) You didn't actually think I was coming to Tudor City, did you?
VOSEN No, I guess not.
VOSEN But if it's me you want to talk to maybe we can arrange a meet.
BOURNE (V.O.) Where are you right now?
VOSEN In my office.
BOURNE (V.O.) I doubt that.
BOURNE (V.O.) If you were in your office--
REVEAL that BOURNE is inside VOSEN'S office.
BOURNE We'd be having this conversation face-to-face.
BOURNE BOURNE hangs up.
BOURNE Puts a portable dictaphone up to VOSEN'S
SAFE and his play:
VOSEN (TAPE V.O.) Noah Vosen.
VOSEN (TAPE V.O.) As he places the plastic slide we saw in the ECUs into the fingerprint reader.
VOSEN (TAPE V.O.) The safe pops open--
VOSEN stunned....
Is it possible?
Is it a trick?
From the safe, BOURNE scoops out the "TREADSTONE: Blackbriar" folder Bourne saw Vosen putting into his safe."
He flips it open.
He scans down the page.
His eye stopping at the words "US Citizen."
He flips to another page -- another photo, and again "US Citizen."
BOURNE shoves the folders in his backpack and leaves.
VOSEN This is a code ten abort, I want everybody back in the vehicles this is a code ten abort!
VOSEN Back to the vehicles immediately, back to CRI immediately.
Bourne rushes down with his back pack.
Wills grabs the phone and hits a speed-dial:
WILLS Bourne got into your safe!
Bourne onto the street with back pack.
SERIES OF SHOTS -- VOSEN'S SUV races, lights and sirens, across town.
2) Other CRI cars race back across town.
BOURNE walks out of a building, backpack over his shoulder.
CAMERA BEGINS TO CRANE UP... BOURNE walks around a corner near CRI.
CAMERA BEGINS TO CRANE UP... He hears a siren turn on a few blocks away.
CAMERA BEGINS TO CRANE UP... Then another.
CAMERA BEGINS TO CRANE UP... He starts to run.
A SEDAN pulls to a stop as a door comes open.
CRONIN'S inside.
REVEAL Landy on the sidewalk.
She jumps in.
LANDY What just happened?
CRONIN Bourne got into Vosen's safe.
LANDY What?!
LANDY Cronin pulls out.
CRONIN Where to?
LANDY 415 East 71st Street.
LANDY Cronin puts it together.
CRONIN 4.15.71...
CRONIN Jesus, Pam.
BOURNE walking away from CRI.
Agents leaving a building.
Getting into unmarked sedans and peeling out.
As Vosen races across town.
VOSEN ...I want the entire building searched.
VOSEN Every room.
VOSEN Every hallway.
VOSEN Every closet.
VOSEN Every goddamm airduct.
VOSEN Do you understand?
VOSEN I want him found!
The passenger side agent sees BOURNE, points--
BOURNE cuts to the south side of the road so the passenger- side agent doesn't have a shot, while controlling the car makes it almost impossible for the driver to fire accurately.
The westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the sidewalk.
But Bourne is too fast.
He's already past them.
The passenger side agent jumps out.
But he's still got to get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead over the hood of his car on Bourne.
The other CRI car races the wrong way on the street but gets immobilized and trapped by the onrushing tunnel traffic.
Vosen and Wills race West on 41st.
CRI cars close in -- on 42nd, on 39th, on 10th Ave.
Bourne races through the tunnel traffic and onto 40th street.
He rushes east toward the spaghetti of concrete ramps leading into and out of Port Authority.
82 He runs across 10th Avenue as a third CRI car screams up the street at him.
Several radios blare.
CRI AGENT (RADIO V.O.) He's heading for Port Authority!
CRI AGENT (RADIO V.O.) Subject up the ramp, eastbound into Port Authority.
VOSEN Lethal force is authorized.
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER I told-
VOSEN Tell them again!
Bourne runs up a one lane outgoing ramp.
The driver pilots his car up the ramp behind Bourne.
He jams the accelerator down.
He'll be on top of Bourne -- running him over -- in seconds--
A New Jersey-bound bus exits the complex and heads around the corner of the ramp -- it skids to a stop when it sees Bourne and the CRI car giving chase heading right at the bus.
The driver has to skid to a stop to avoid hitting the bus.
Bourne slides between the side of the bus and concrete guard rail.
The driver calls it in--
Cops and CRI cars close in on Port Authority.
One agent jumps out of his car on 8th Avenue and rushes for the stairs.
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER (V.O.) Block every exit.
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER (V.O.) I want a full perimeter on Port Authority--
Bourne races up a set of stairs the rooftop parking lot.
He surveys every aspect of his environment on the fly (which includes his taking a quick peak over the concrete railing at the east end of the roof.
Next Bourne rushes toward the parked cars.
Smashes the window of one to set off its alarm.
Then a second and a third, setting off their alarms.
The fourth window Bourne smashes in doesn't set off an alarm.
Bourne pulls the door open and climbs in.
Inside the car Bourne reaches under the dash and yanks handful of wires off the steering column and starts to expertly hotwire the car.
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER Box him in!
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER Box him in!
Agents race up stairwells.
Two CRI cars careen up the ramp to the passenger parking (a separate ramp to the bus ramp we saw Bourne on earlier.)
A third CRI car races through the parking level just below the roof and up the circular ramp to the roof.
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER He's on the roof.
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER He's trapped.
EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY Bourne works to hotwire the car.
EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY A CRI car gets to the roof.
EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY Two agents come from the elevator lobby.
EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY The three car alarms distract them.
EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY They search for Bourne, but can't find him at first...
EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still locked.
84 A second CRI car arrives.
84 Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high speed.
84 He smashes into the car across the aisle from him.
84 With a sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and stops.
84 Three CRI cars here now.
84 Two head straight for him.
84 A third blocks the exit ramp.
84 Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate metal and concrete).
84 They move into position to get a bead on him.
84 Bourne assesses.
84 But he doesn't move.
84 The agents swarm toward him.
84 What the hell is he doing?
84 Why is he waiting?
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER We've got him!
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER He's got nowhere to run!
VOSEN Take him out!
The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels toward Bourne--
But before they can get a bead--
Bourne slams the car into reverse again.
Petal to the metal in reverse--
The agents open fire.
Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield.
But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass.
As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent adjusts his fire into the car's grill.
Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's driveline.
Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek behind him.
85 Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking structure.
85 Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his car up and over the wall.
85 Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's car, to the shooters.
85 Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25 feet and slams onto a row of parked cars.
85 The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard against the roof.
85 Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over- turned car.
CRI AGENT Ho-ly shit!
VOSEN He did what?!
The CRI agents race to the spot where Bourne's car disappeared over the railing and reflexively fire into Bourne's car but they're too late!
Bourne's already out.
He disappears from sight under the covered parking structure.
LEAD CRI AGENT Get down there!
LEAD CRI AGENT Get down!
As it speeds toward the spaghetti of ramps leading in and out of Port Authority -- two blocks away.
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER Who has eyeball on him?!
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER Who has eyeball?!
One of the agents scrambles over the edge and starts to climb down.
Other agents race for the stairs.
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER (V.O.) Don't tell me--
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER --you've lost him!
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER Who's on street level?!
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER Street level backup?!
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER Clearly there is no one down there.
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER Bourne's car jump from the roof has completely flat-footed them.
VOSEN Get NYPD backup!
VOSEN And FBI, DEA, any other federal assets we can draft!
Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the level Bourne's on.
Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the roof lands hard behind him.
Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in a head on charge.
The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control, shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to the floor as he dives out of the car.
The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on.
Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses, glass shatters, and airbags explode.
Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his car implodes against the oncoming agents.
Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the course of the wrecked one.
The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out and points his gun at the driver.
The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate effort to save his own life.
As the sedan suddenly accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the sedan's front tire and fires.
The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against the unyielding interior of the sedan.
An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.
With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.
Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof, arrives and opens fire.
The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single shot.
The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs the officer's radio.
BOURNE 10-13.
BOURNE Shots fired.
BOURNE Officer down.
BOURNE Port Authority parking lot.
BOURNE Level four.
Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift tourniquet for the officer.
Then he hands the cop his radio back.
BOURNE (CONT'D) Stay out of sight until one of your own arrive.
Bourne disappears.
We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the engine and heads for the exits.
CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps.
But that's all the time Bourne needs--
Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east, followed closely by a CRI sedan.
As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the right.
It ricochets off several parked cars before regaining control.
Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out by hitting his bumper.
Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car.
The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.
Bourne is home free.
He looks around and spots a sign that indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US 95."
Bourne turns right--
Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the top of Bourne's leg.
REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane.
As Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches it into the side of Bourne's car.
Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car.
With his front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's car by sliding into his path.
Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the slightly damaged sedan in pursuit.
Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of.
Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the intersection completely blocking his path.
Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues on, barreling into the roadblock backwards.
As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake.
Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a right hand turn onto South St.
as Paz and the CRI sedan overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle.
On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just ahead.
Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right:
The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate through the upcoming intersection.
As he does, the cop car Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car.
Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the oncoming traffic.
Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the street ahead.
The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches it back into the lane as it slams against the front of Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked cars.
Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the road.
SMOKE and STEAM -- SIRENS -- CHAOS
90 BOURNE kicks the window out of the police car.
90 Gun up...
90 Ready--
287A PAZ in the car.
Still.
Bloody from the crash, really 287A fucked up.
He comes to...and Bourne is there.
Gun pointed at his head...
The two assassins look at each other...then Bourne lowers his gun...and disappears...
ON PAZ -- as the wheels start to turn...
WILLS The asset lost Bourne.
WILLS We lost him.
WILLS Vosen reacts--
Bourne exits from the subway.
Bourne walks north.
Wills pacing...
Bourne's profile is up on Screen 2.
It says "David Webb (AKA Jason Bourne)" on the profile.
A tech comes to Wills.
TECH Sir, this may be nothing but, look at Bourne's birthday.
TECH Wills looks at the profile.
TECH Bourne's birthdate is listed as 9/13/70.
WILLS What about it?
TECH Well, Landy told Bourne his birthday was 4/15/71 so...
TECH Wills gets it instantly.
WILLS Everything stops.
EVERYTHING STOPS! LISTEN UP! New assignment.
EVERYTHING STOPS! LISTEN UP! Numbers.
EVERYTHING STOPS! LISTEN UP! Four.
WILLS (cont'd) Fifteen.
WILLS (cont'd) Seventy-one.
WILLS (cont'd) What do they mean?
WILLS (cont'd) Wills grabs his headset--
A CRI agent approaches Vosen.
CRI AGENT Landy gave Bourne a false birthday.
CRI AGENT Wills thinks it's a code.
CRI AGENT It sinks in for Vosen...oh...shit...
BOURNE emerges into the crowed street, headed uptown.
Wills watches the techs work.
TECH #3 -- if you plug them in as variants of latitude and longitude you get Cameroon -- Peru -- Colombia --
TECH #2 -- San Francisco's got a four-one- five area code --
TECH #1 -- 41571 is the zip code for Varney, Kentucky --
TECH #4 -- there's no 415 West 71st Street, but there is a 415 East 71st --
TECH #1 -- if it's a substitution code, we're way short on variables, which I -- (no chance to finish as--
WILLS --hang on -- wait -- Seventy First Street?
WILLS Like what?
WILLS Like York and First?
TECH #4 That's correct.
TECH #4 Wills like he's been hit.
TECH #4 Like hard.
TECH #4 As we cut to --
They race uptown.
WILLS She gave him the facility.
WILLS She gave him--
VOSEN I know.
VOSEN Go!
VOSEN Go!
VOSEN Drive!
VOSEN We're already on our way.
VOSEN Turn the teams around.
VOSEN Bring them in behind me.
Vosen steely eyed as they race uptown.
He dials a number--
Bourne reaches 71st street and 2nd Ave.
He looks up at the sign...
AFTERNOON Hirsch's office is located in the SRD's "front office", which is located covertly on a floor of the new building of the hospital.
AFTERNOON He is the longtime head of SRD and a powerful behind-the-scenes official at CIA.
THE CAMERA FINDS DR.
THE CAMERA FINDS HIRSCH, 70, is, put simply, not a man to be trifled with.
THE CAMERA FINDS He's a 45 year CIA veteran.
THE CAMERA FINDS One of the great brains in the Agency's history, but also a man who knows how to wield power silently, invisibly, and to tremendous effect.
THE CAMERA FINDS His phone buzzes.
DR. HIRSCH (INTO PHONE) Hello.
VOSEN at the other end of the line --
VOSEN (INTO PHONE) Bourne knows everything.
VOSEN (INTO PHONE) I think he's heading for you right now.
VOSEN (INTO PHONE) Dead pause.
HIRSCH (INTO PHONE) He's coming home, Noah.
HIRSCH (INTO PHONE) There's a wistfulness in the way he says it.
HIRSCH (INTO PHONE) But also the sense that this was absolutely inevitable.
HIRSCH (INTO PHONE) And he's calm about it, doesn't show any fear, doesn't reach for a gun.
HIRSCH (INTO PHONE) How long do I have?
VOSEN Not long.
VOSEN Get out of there.
HIRSCH No.
HIRSCH I'm going to stay.
VOSEN Are you crazy, he'll--
HIRSCH He'll come to the training wing.
HIRSCH That's what he knows.
HIRSCH I'll keep him in play until you arrive.
Bourne arrives at the "Johnston Medical Center."
He looks up to see "415".
The image of "415" that has been haunting his dreams.
This is the place...
When he looks down Landy steps out of the lobby to meet him on the sidewalk.
BOURNE They'll kill you for giving me this place.
LANDY 4/15/71 isn't much of a code.
LANDY My guess is Vosen's already on his way.
BOURNE Why'd you do it?
LANDY This isn't us, David.
LANDY What they turned you into, what they're doing with Blackbriar...
LANDY This has to stop.
BOURNE Then stop it.
BOURNE Everything you need is in there.
BOURNE Bourne hands her the black bag and enters the hospital.
LANDY David...
LANDY Come in with me.
LANDY It's better if we do this together.
BOURNE This is where it started for me, this is where it ends.
BOURNE She watches the doors close behind him....
BOURNE Landy lets him go.
QUICK SHOTS of six different CRI sedans and SUVs rushing toward the hospital.
Landy looks in the backpack.
--She unzips the backpack and looks in at the the Blackbriar Operations File.
--A cover page inside: "utmost secrecy"...
"potentially explosive public reaction would jeopardize the program"...
--Another page: "Terminated" stamped across the photos of victims.
Next to the victim from the inciting incident, the words: "US citizen"...
LANDY Oh, my God...
LANDY --A third page, more photos, no "terminated" on these.
LANDY Future victims.
LANDY "US citizen" stamped next to each one...
Bourne uses the card reader he took from Vosen's safe to enter a "restricted access elevator."
A guard comes.
Bourne aims his pistol at him as the elevator door closes.
Landy walks down the street.
She looks up to spot two black sedans speeding east on 71st, turns south -- two SUVs coming up York.
Shit--
A block south of the hospital, stuck in traffic, Vosen points.
VOSEN Landy!
VOSEN Right there!
VOSEN She's got Bourne's backpack!
Bourne flips up the elevator stop button and uses the access card to enter a secure corridor--
Landy runs across the lobby.
Vosen's SUV careens to a stop behind a bunch of traffic.
Still a half block from the entry door but it's close enough--
Bourne rushes down a nondescript corridor--
Vosen and CRI agents rush into the lobby.
VOSEN I'll find Landy.
VOSEN You get to the training wing and get Bourne!
VOSEN A security guard comes over.
VOSEN Do you know who I am?
VOSEN Where's your security room?
Landy looks around.
Finds an open office.
She pushes open the door and runs to the fax machine.
She starts faxing the Blackbriar documents Bourne took from Vosen's safe.
Vosen enters.
VOSEN I want to see all your footage for the last three minutes.
AFTERNOON Bourne stares down the corridor from his dreams, the corridor Daniels lead him down in his flashback.
AFTERNOON We see Bourne go into--
That first day, Bourne's POV being led down this corridor by Daniels.
Bourne moves down the corridor.
AFTERNOON Bourne reaches the end of the hall.
AFTERNOON He looks around "flashback style" --
Bourne was standing at this door....
Vosen enters the room.
The last pages have been faxed...
LANDY You better get a good lawyer.
LANDY She exits...
Then spins, gun up--
Hirsch is there, halfway down the corridor behind him.
HIRSCH Put the gun down.
HIRSCH I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to talk.
BOURNE I've spent three years running.
BOURNE Three years trying to find out who I was.
BOURNE Hirsch moves toward Bourne, completely unfazed by the gun.
HIRSCH You still don't have it all back, do you?
HIRSCH You haven't filled in all the pieces?
BOURNE Let's start with the moment you found out I wouldn't execute Wombosi.
BOURNE The amnesia wasn't the issue, it was the fact that I didn't pull the trigger....
HIRSCH One lapse meant your conditioning had failed.
HIRSCH Bourne grabs Hirsch and slams him against the wall
BOURNE It was always you, behind Conklin, behind Abbott....
BOURNE They were just following orders.
BOURNE Bourne grabs Hirsch and pushes him to the wall.
BOURNE Searches him for weapons.
HIRSCH I'm unarmed, Jason.
BOURNE "David."
BOURNE I'm David Webb.
BOURNE CLOSE ON Bourne's face--
HIRSCH You were David Webb, but not anymore.
Bourne stands with Hirsch.
BOURNE Why me?
BOURNE Why did you pick me?
BOURNE A beat...
HIRSCH You really don't remember, do you?
HIRSCH You picked us, Jason.
BOURNE What does that mean?
HIRSCH You volunteered.
HIRSCH Hirsch uses his free hand to hit the keypad on the wall.
HIRSCH The "room in use" sign lights up.
HIRSCH Bourne looks up "flashback style"--
Bourne remembers that keypad, that "room in use" sign from the first day...
Bourne and Hirsch enter...
HIRSCH You volunteered right here....
HIRSCH You didn't even blink, Jason.
HIRSCH You just handed me these...
99 Hirsch removes a pair of dog tags from his jacket pocket.
99 Holds them out to Bourne.
99 Bourne takes the dog tags.
99 Stares at them.
INSERT of the dog tags:
Webb, David
946610190 O Negative
946610190 Catholic
Bourne hands over his dog tags....
HIRSCH (CONT'D) Has everything been explained to you.
BOURNE Yes, sir.
HIRSCH You were a soldier ready to serve his country.
HIRSCH Just like thousands of others, except you were a prodigy with languages...and a perfect shot.
HIRSCH (CONT'D) Your missions will save American lives.
BOURNE You said I'd be saving American lives.
BOURNE Instead you just turned me into a killer.
BOURNE Bourne raises the gun to Hirsch.
HIRSCH You could have left at any time.
HIRSCH And you knew exactly what it meant for you if you chose to stay.
HIRSCH When we're finished with you, you'll no longer be David Webb.
BOURNE I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.
HIRSCH Stop running from the truth, Jason.
HIRSCH You chose to come here!
HIRSCH You chose to stay!
HIRSCH And no matter how much you want to forget it...eventually you're going to have to face how you chose, right there, to become Jason Bourne!
Bourne sitting in a chair, looking terrible.
Hirsch looks at him from behind the desk...
HIRSCH (CONT'D) You haven't slept for a long time have you David?
HIRSCH (CONT'D) Have you made a decision?
HIRSCH (CONT'D) This can't go on, you know.
HIRSCH (CONT'D) You have to decide.
BOURNE Who is he?
HIRSCH We've been through that.
BOURNE What did he do?
HIRSCH It doesn't matter.
HIRSCH You came to us.
HIRSCH You volunteered.
HIRSCH You said you'd do anything it takes to save American lives.
HIRSCH You're not a liar are you?
HIRSCH Or too weak to see this through?
HIRSCH This is it.
HIRSCH Let go of David Webb.
HIRSCH Will you give yourself to this program?
101 Bourne looks down, a gun in his hand.
101 He gets to his feet swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded figure.
101 The man slumps over.
101 Bourne stares at what he's done.
HIRSCH (CONT'D) You're no longer David Webb.
HIRSCH (CONT'D) From now on you'll be known as Jason Bourne.
HIRSCH (CONT'D) Welcome to the program.
HIRSCH (CONT'D) Daniels pulls the hood off the figure to show that he is dead.
HIRSCH (CONT'D) Just then Kramer walks through the door.
KRAMER He's ready.
KRAMER Send him to Operations.
And now, in real time, Bourne comes out of the flashback.
He stares back at Hirsch....
HIRSCH Do you remember now?
HIRSCH Bourne lowers the gun.
BOURNE I remember.
BOURNE I remember everything.
HIRSCH You can't outrun what you did, Jason.
HIRSCH You made yourself into who you are.
BOURNE I'm done running.
BOURNE That's why I'm here.
BOURNE To end you, to shut this down.
BOURNE I'm no longer Jason Bourne.
HIRSCH So now you're going to kill me?
BOURNE No.
BOURNE You don't deserve the star they give you on the wall at Langley.
BOURNE Just then Bourne spins -- agents arrive at the door.
BOURNE It's locked.
The agents fire at the door handle to get it open.
Bourne looks out a window.
Sees the layout of a roof several stories below.
Then he turns and shoots out the room's mirrored observation window.
Bourne dives through it just as agents rush in and open fire at him.
SERIES OF SHOTS Bourne races through corridors, loosing the CRI agents.
Bourne runs out onto the roof.
Rushes across it to look over the edge.
It's a straight drop to the FDR -- 12 stories down.
He races to another ledge -- the East River below him.
But he has to clear a 10 foot supporting wall at the base of the building to hit the water.
He backs up to get a running leap.
As he does, he turns and sees Paz, who is holding a gun on him.
PAZ Why didn't you take the shot?
PAZ Bourne looks at him.
BOURNE Do you even know why you're trying to kill me?
BOURNE Look at what they make you give.
BOURNE Bourne turns and runs off the roof.
BOURNE Paz fires into the air...
BOURNE FOLLOW Bourne as he drops fourteen stories into the freezing river--
BOURNE MULTIPLE ANGLES -- Bourne goes into the river...
Bourne in a dead man's float...as his clothes soak through he begins to sink....
103 PULL BACK...farther and farther from Bourne's dead still
sinking....as OVERLAPPING, INTERWEAVING VOICE OVERS begin:

She stands there, eyes fixed on a TV behind the bar:
ANCHOR 5 (V.O., CONT'D) Webb, who was known inside the intelligence community, as "Jason Bourne" jumped from the fourteenth floor of the CIA facility where he was trained in New York into the East River below.
ANCHOR 5 (V.O., CONT'D) While experts say it would be nearly impossible to survive the fall, despite two weeks of efforts, his body has still not been recovered.

ANCHOR 5 (V.O., CONT'D) As we CUE the Moby "Extreme Ways" sting---
Bourne's body sinking toward the bottom...when all of a sudden it comes to life -- arms together, legs kick powerfully--
