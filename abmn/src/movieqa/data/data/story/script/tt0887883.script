BURN AFTER READING
Written by
Joel Coen & Ethan Coen
High in the air----so high we an see the curvature of the earth.
The eastern seaboard stretches away, flecked with clouds.
As we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color.
We are looking down at the city of Washington, D.C.
Dissolve closer still: a black-and-white aerial photograph of a neighborhood in suburban D.C. dominated by a sprawling building.
Computer type quickly bleeps on:
C.I.A.
Headquarters Langley, Virginia
We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of someone walking down the well polished hallway.
We hear a door opening and a silver-haired man rises behind his desk.
A nameplate on the desk identifies him as Palmer DeBakey Smith.
PALMER Ozzie.
PALMER Sit down.
Osbourne Cox, entering, is a middle-aged man in a striped shirt and bow tie.
OSBOURNE Palmer.
OSBOURNE What's up.
PALMER You know Peck, and Olson.
The two men, sitting on chairs facing the desk, nod at Osbourne, who is surprised to see them.
OSBOURNE Peck, yes, hiya.
OSBOURNE Olson, by reputation.
OSBOURNE Hi, Osbourne Cox.
OLSON Yeah, hiyah.
OSBOURNE Aren't you with...aren't you, uh...
Palmer jumps in:
PALMER Yeah, that's right.
PALMER Oz, look.
PALMER There's no easy way to say this.
PALMER We're taking you off the Balkans desk.
OSBOURNE You're----what?
OSBOURNE Why?
PALMER In fact we're moving you out of Sigint entirely.
OSBOURNE ...What?
OSBOURNE No discussion, just----you're out?
PALMER Well, we're having the discussion now Oz.
PALMER This doesn't have to be unpleasant.
OSBOURNE Palmer, with all due respect----what the fuck are you talking about?
A beat.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) And why is Olson here?
Another uncomfortable beat.
PALMER ...
PALMER Look, Ozzie----
OSBOURNE What the fuck is this?!
OSBOURNE Is it my----I know it's not my work.
PALMER Ozzie----
OSBOURNE I'm a great fucking analyst!
OSBOURNE Is it----
PALMER Oz, things are not going well.
PALMER As you know.
PECK You have a drinking problem.
Stunned silence.
Ozzie turns to look at Peck.
At length:
OSBOURNE I have a drinking problem.
PALMER This doesn't have to be unpleasant.
PALMER We found you something in State.
PALMER It's a, uh...
He gropes, uncomfortable.
PALMER (CONT'D) ...
PALMER (CONT'D) It's a lower clearance level.
PALMER (CONT'D) Yes.
PALMER (CONT'D) But we're not, this isn't, we're not terminating you.
OSBOURNE This is an assault.
PECK Come on, Ozzie.
OSBOURNE This is an assault.
OSBOURNE I have a drinking problem?
OSBOURNE Fuck you, Peck, you're a Mormon!
PECK Ozzie----
OSBOURNE Next to you we all have a drinking problem!
OSBOURNE Fuck you guys!
OSBOURNE Whose ass didn't I kiss?
OSBOURNE Let's be honest!
Palmer nods at Olson.
PALMER Okay, Olson----
OSBOURNE Let's be fucking honest...
Osbourne gets to his feet, agitated.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) This is a crucifixion!
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) This is political!
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Don't tell me it's not!
He storms out the door.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I have a drinking problem!
The door slams.
Palmer Smith looks at Olson.
Olson arches an eyebrow.
Bow tie loosened, he stands at a kitchen counter.
His shoulders twist as he does something below frame: we hear the crackle of ice cubes wrenching loose from a tray.
Behind him we see the apartment door opening.
Katie, an attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne.
KATIE You're home.
Osbourne continues making himself a drink.
OSBOURNE Hang on to your hat, honey.
OSBOURNE I have some news.
OSBOURNE I----
KATIE Did you pick up the cheeses?
OSBOURNE Huh?
KATIE Were they ready?
KATIE I didn't know you were coming home this early.
OSBOURNE The cheeses.
Katie rolls her eyes.
KATIE I left a message for you to stop at Todaro's.
KATIE The Magruders and the Pfarrers are coming over.
OSBOURNE The Pfarrers?
OSBOURNE Ugh.
OSBOURNE I----what did Kathleen say?
KATIE What?
OSBOURNE When you left the message?
KATIE She said.
KATIE She would give you.
KATIE The message.
OSBOURNE Well she, I don't know, I guess we had bigger news today.
OSBOURNE My day didn't revolve arou----
KATIE So you didn't get the cheeses.
OSBOURNE Well, since I didn't get the message, no, I didn't get the cheeses.
OSBOURNE But hang on to your hat, I----
KATIE Oh for fuck's sake, Ozzie, you mean I have to go out again?
KATIE All right, well, you better get dressed.
OSBOURNE Honey, we have to talk.
KATIE Not right now.
KATIE They'll be here in, what, less than an hour.
A hand hovers, hesitates.
VOICE Is this a, uh, goat cheese?
OSBOURNE (OFF) Chevre, yes, that is a goat cheese.
OSBOURNE (OFF) Pink Revision 8/14/07 6.
Wider shows the cocktail party, meagerly attended but in full swing.
Besides Osbourne and Katie there is Harry Pfarrer (who has just inquired about the cheese), bearded, forties, rugged; his wife Sandy; and a shiny-faced young couple, Doug and Tina Magruder.
Osbourne holds a cocktail tumbler.
HARRY Because I have lactose reflux.
HARRY But I can----
OSBOURNE You're lactose intolerant?
HARRY Yes, but I can----
OSBOURNE Or you have acid reflux?
OSBOURNE They're two different things.
Harry looks at him coldly.
HARRY I know what they are.
OSBOURNE Then you misspoke yourself.
OSBOURNE So I----
HARRY Thank you for correcting me.
KATIE You should try the chevre, Harry.
KATIE It's very good.
HARRY Yeah.
HARRY I can eat goat cheese.
He eats a piece, cupping one hand under his mouth.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) I was just explaining to your husband here, I have a condition----
Katie tries to separate the two men by including Doug Magruder.
KATIE Harry works with the Marshalls' * Service.
KATIE Pink Revision 8/14/07 6A.
Ah.
I'm on the legislative side, I * work with Senator Hobby.
Pink Revision 8/14/07 7.
HARRY * Used to work for Treasury, but I * didn't go over to Homeland Security.
HARRY * * I'm with the Marshalls.
OSBOURNE If you want he'll show you his great big gun.
HARRY Very amusing.
HARRY The gun is actually no big deal.
HARRY Twenty years in the marshall's service and I've never discharged my weapon.
OSBOURNE Sounds like something you should be telling your psychiatrist.
HARRY What?
HARRY I don't have a psychiatrist.
DOUG MAGRUDER Boy, I guess my job is pretty undramatic.
DOUG MAGRUDER I'm on the legislative side.
DOUG MAGRUDER What do you do Mrs. Pfarrer?
DOUG MAGRUDER Do you also carry a gun?
Harry laughs.
HARRY Sandy writes children's books.
SANDY I write children's books----
HARRY Oliver The Cat Who...Who..arghh----Who----
Choking on piece of cheese, coughing
HARRY (CONT'D) ...Who Lives In The Rotunda.
HARRY (CONT'D) Excuse me.
TINA Those are wonderful!
TINA My nieces and nephews----
HARRY Yeah, it's a beloved series.
HARRY You wouldn't believe her fan mail.
HARRY Unghh.
HARRY Are you sure this is goat cheese?
KATIE Why don't you let your wife tell them about her own books, Harry?
HARRY I'm sorry----was I----
KATIE Here, come in the kitchen, help me with the crudites.
They enter.
HARRY Goddamnit.
HARRY He knows, doesn't he.
He looks down at the floor.
He stamps.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Nice floors.
KATIE Knows what?
Harry is looking around the kitchen, taking in the fixtures.
Absently:
HARRY About us, he knows about us.
HARRY Little prick.
KATIE Don't be an ass, he doesn't know a thing.
Harry is staring down at the linoleum again.
HARRY What is that, forbo?
A car drives by.
Harry driving, his wife next to him.
A long beat.
Finally:
HARRY What a horse's ass.
SANDY I don't know why we see them.
Harry shrugs.
HARRY Well, she's all right.
SANDY She is a cold, stuck-up bitch.
Harry opens his mouth to reply, considers, doesn't.
They drive.
She is staring, in front of a mirror, face covered in cold cream, one hand arrested on the way up to daub on more.
KATIE You quit?!
Osbourne is buttoning a pajama top.
OSBOURNE Uh-huh.
KATIE Well----Thank you for letting me know!
OSBOURNE I tried to tell you this afternoon.
KATIE You tried?
KATIE You tried?
KATIE And then---- what, the aphasia kicked in?
OSBOURNE Our guests came.
OSBOURNE We----
Why?!
For fuck's sake, Ozzie!
I'm just----I don't know.
I got so tired.
You're tired.
Tired of swimming against the current.
Uh-huh.
Independent thought is not only not valued there, they resist it, they fight it, the bureaucracy is positively----
Did you get a pension, or severance or something, or----
I didn't retire you know, I, I quit.
I don't want their benefits.
But I suppose my benefits are all right, I suppose you can live with those, is that the idea?
It's not like that's the only way to make money.
Yes?
Yes?
What're you gonna do?
I'll do some consulting.
Consulting.
Yes, to help while I----I've always wanted to write.
Write.
Write what.
OSBOURNE I've been thinking about it.
OSBOURNE A book, a sort of, sort of memoir.
Katie stares at him in the mirror.
A beat.
She bursts into laughter.
A small yacht.
Osbourne stands at the wheel, a light wind in his face, as the boat sails under motor power.
After a beat he moves to the front of the boat.
An old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the wind.
He has snowy hair and a stern Yankee face.
He wears a tweed cap.
He doesn't much react to Osbourne's approach.
OSBOURNE You okay there, Dad?
The old man remains silent, staring.
Osbourne sits next to him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the man's knees.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Dad, I left my job at the Agency...
The old man stares out into the wind.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I, uh...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Dad, government service is not what it was when you were in State.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Things are different now.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I don't know, maybe it's...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) it's...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) the Cold War ending; now it seems like it's all bureaucracy and no mission...
The old man stares out into the wind.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I'm writing a memoir.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I think it's going to be pretty explosive.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) But I don't think you'll disapprove.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I don't think you'll disapprove.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Katie has had trouble accepting it.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) But...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) sometimes there's a higher patriotism, Dad.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) So we'll...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Yes, change is hard.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) It's hard on Katie.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) But we'll be okay.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) We'll be okay.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Life is change.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) This is good.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) We were all blocked up, Katie and me.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) This is, this is a blessing in disguise.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I'll go into training, you know.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Lay off the sauce.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Like you did.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) You managed to do it.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Finally.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) And then I can concentrate on, you know.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) New beginning.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) And this'll all have been for the best.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Don't you think Dad?
The old man stares out into the wind.
Osbourne sniffles.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Cold.
He taps the old man on the knee and rises.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I guess we should head back.
The sailboat docked at the end of a marina.
Osbourne is pushing the old man in a wheel chair down the pier away from the boat.
A MAN'S VOICE We've seen this...
White hair, bushy eyebrows, a florid face.
He is in a law- book lined conference room.
He wears an expensive suit, suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs.
He is Bogus Terikhian.
TERIKHIAN ...
TERIKHIAN I know this kind of man.
TERIKHIAN We've seen this.
Wider on the conference room shows that Katie Cox sits at the table, along with Terikhian, another lawyer, and an assistant.
TERIKHIAN (CONT'D) ...
TERIKHIAN (CONT'D) Mrs. Cox, you can't let this man take advantage of you.
TERIKHIAN (CONT'D) And he will.
TERIKHIAN (CONT'D) He will.
KATIE Yes.
KATIE This is my fear.
KATIE He's trying---- he says----he's trying to pull himself together, but...
TERIKHIAN Look, sure, I----I'm obliged to tell you you should try to salvage things.
TERIKHIAN And you should.
TERIKHIAN People turn themselves around.
TERIKHIAN Not unheard-of.
TERIKHIAN But.
TERIKHIAN You---- you haven't broached the possibility of divorce yet?
KATIE No.
TERIKHIAN Well that's good.
TERIKHIAN Because first you should get all his financials.
TERIKHIAN Before he's forewarned.
TERIKHIAN Because here's a man, here's a man, practiced in deceit, this is almost, you could say it's his job, practiced at hiding things, and there is no reason, it is not improper, there is no reason for you not to get a picture of the household finances.
TERIKHIAN Paper files, computer files, whatever----this is your prerogative.
TERIKHIAN You can be a spy too, madam.
TERIKHIAN Do this before you put him on alert.
TERIKHIAN Before the turtle can draw in his head and his, uh...
He waggles his hands, groping for the word.
TERIKHIAN (CONT'D) ...
TERIKHIAN (CONT'D) Feet.
He shrugs.
TERIKHIAN (CONT'D) ...
TERIKHIAN (CONT'D) And hopefully everything will work
out.
He will reform.
But!
If not: forewarned is forearmed.
Osbourne is splayed on an easy chair, wearing a bathrobe over pyjamas.
He stares at the ceiling, motionless, arms out- flung, like Marat in his bathtub.
A long still beat.
A clock ticks.
Abruptly Osbourne raises one hand to speak into a microcassette recorder.
OSBOURNE We were young and committed and there was nothing we couldn't do.
OSBOURNE We thought of the Agency less as...
OSBOURNE less as...
The thought, such as it was, peters out.
Osbourne rises and wanders around the room, glassy-eyed.
He suddenly raises the microcassette again.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) The principles of George Kennan----a personal hero of mine----were what animated us.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) In fact they were what had originally inspired me to enter government service.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Like the State Department's China Hands of yore, or, in a different forum, in a different venue, in a different medium, in, um...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) "Murrow's Boys," the fabled----in a different----
He suddenly stops, head cocked, listening.
Faintly, a ringing phone.
At the cut Osbourne is thundering down a steep carpeted stairway.
He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that juts over the bottom half of the stairwell.
The phone is louder here.
A semi-finished basement with cheap paneling and a low dropped ceiling of water-stained Johnson-Armstrong tile.
The ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk.
The answering machine, with Osbourne's voice, picks up:
MACHINE You have reached The Cox Group...
Osbourne, robe flapping, shuffles hurriedly in his slippered feet toward the phone.
MACHINE (CONT'D) ...
MACHINE (CONT'D) We can't answer your call right now.
MACHINE (CONT'D) Please leave a----
OSBOURNE Hello.
He eases into the chair, having swiped up the phone.
A listening beat.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Yes?...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Oh, no...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) No, call her number...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) No, upstairs...No she's not, but leave it on her machine.
We are looking over Osbourne's shoulder----he is still in his robe----as he sits hunched on an ottoman, looking at a daytime game show.
A few beats of the show.
Roaring laughter from the studio audience.
Mild chuckle from Osbourne in the foreground.
Ticking clock.
Osbourne paces with the microcassette recorder.
He raises it with a thought, draws a breath, and then stops, and looks off.
The ticking grandfather clock: ornate hands on an ornate clock face Two or three minutes to five.
Osbourne stares for a long beat.
Shoulders twisting as we hear ice clattering out of a tray.
He pours coke sizzling onto the ice.
He pauses for a long beat.
He takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet.
He pours some into a hatch-marked shot glass.
He looks at it.
The amber liquid tops the hatch mark.
He conscientiously pours the overage back, murmuring:
OSBOURNE Single...
He dumps the shot into the Coke.
As before, the boat, docked at the end of the marina pier, is seen in long shot through the windshield of a car.
Closer on the boat.
As water laps against pilings and the boat gently bobs and creaks, we hear, muffled, the sounds of a couple having sex.
When it builds to climax we cut:
Minutes later.
We hold on a door for a quiet beat, then we hear the gurgle of water, and then the door opens.
Harry Pfarrer emerges from the small bathroom, buckling his belt.
In the bedroom which he emerges into Katie Cox is just finishing dressing.
Harry looks at his watch.
HARRY I should try to get a run in.
Katie is letting herself in.
KATIE Ozzie!
Quiet.
Katie enters and sees a note on the counter paperweighted by a plate of used lime wedges:
17. Honey,
17. At Fenninger's.
17. Reunion committee dinner.
17. See you later.
Long-lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry Pfarrer is jogging in his Treasury sweats.
Closer on him.
Brow furrows.
He spins, jogs backwards, looking.
His point-of-view: nothing unusual; traffic on the bridge, no pedestrians particularly close.
Harry, mildly puzzled, slows and stops.
He turns again.
Point-of-view up the bridge: empty.
Harry starts jogging again.
We are tracking toward the desk in the corner, at which Katie sits.
She cracks open a CD case and loads the CD into Osbourne's computer.
A suspense drone builds as we track in.
Katie starts typing, then suddenly stops.
She holds still, listening for noises in the house.
Nothing.
She resumes typing.
We hear male voices beginning to swell in song.
The voices continue after the suspense drone snaps off, at the cut to:
A musty steakhouse.
On the walls are hunting-scene prints and steel engravings of English country houses.
A placard resting on a chair outside the Georgian Room:
From inside the room, male voices:
VOICES Tune every heart and every voice...
A dozen middle-aged men around a long table, each holding high a glass.
MEN ...
MEN Bid every care withdraw.
MEN Let all with one accord rejoice...
The men are sweaty, tie-loosened, dinner-stuffed and boozy.
MEN (CONT'D) ...
MEN (CONT'D) In praise of Old Nassau...
Close on Osbourne as a rotund middle-aged classmate fills his glass to brimming.
The two sway unsteadily with the music..
MEN (CONT'D) ...
MEN (CONT'D) In praise of Old Nassau my boys, Hoo-rah, hoo-rah, hoorah!
All swing their glasses side-to-side in rhythm:
MEN (CONT'D) ...
MEN (CONT'D) Her sons...
MEN (CONT'D) shall give...
MEN (CONT'D) while they...
MEN (CONT'D) shall live...
Glasses are thrust high with a ringing finish:
MEN (CONT'D) ...
MEN (CONT'D) In praise of Old Nassau!
Bare.
Pale.
Middle-aged.
Someone with a marker is drawing on the flesh to illustrate:
DOCTOR (OFF) We take all the chicken fat off your buttocks, here...
DOCTOR (OFF) and here...
DOCTOR (OFF) And the upper arms.
DOCTOR (OFF) And a little off your tummy...
The camera is arcing around a standing, naked, middle-aged woman, to reveal the doctor sitting on a stool in the examining room, facing her.
He reaches forward again with the marker.
DOCTOR (OFF) (CONT'D) ...And we do breast augmentation with a tiny incision here...
DOCTOR (OFF) (CONT'D) and here.
PATIENT (OFF) Uh-huh.
PATIENT (OFF) And what about the thigh area?
DOCTOR Well we can do liposuction there as well, but that area will respond to exercise.
DOCTOR Buttocks and upper arms begin to store more fat when you get up around forty, the body just tells it to go there, but the thighs will respond to toning exercises.
PATIENT Uh-huh.
PATIENT I know, I can work out on my arms til the cows come home, but...
DOCTOR Uh-huh.
DOCTOR And of course there are also genetic factors.
PATIENT The Litzkes are big.
DOCTOR Uh-huh, well everything's----
PATIENT My mom had an ass that could pull a bus.
DOCTOR Wow.
DOCTOR Well that's a predispo----
PATIENT Father's side too, although Dad tends to carry his weight in front of him.
DOCTOR Uh-huh.
PATIENT In the gut area.
PATIENT Derriere, not so much.
DOCTOR Okay.
The continuing track around is also booming up to reveal the face of the patient, Linda Litzke.
LINDA And what about the face, you know, the window to the soul.
DOCTOR Uh-huh!
DOCTOR Uh-huh!
DOCTOR Very well put.
DOCTOR Well your eyes are one of your best features.
DOCTOR But we can do something about the incipient crow's feet.
LINDA Baby crow's feet.
LINDA Little chickling's feet.
LINDA I mean chicks.
LINDA Chickie chickie chickie.
DOCTOR Ha-ha, yes, again, well put.
DOCTOR You have a way with words.
DOCTOR We cut here...
He marks.
DOCTOR (CONT'D) ...
DOCTOR (CONT'D) And we pull the skin tight, like stretching the skin over a drum.
DOCTOR (CONT'D) Not too tight, though.
DOCTOR (CONT'D) We don't want that "worked-on" look.
DOCTOR (CONT'D) You need sufficient slack for the face to remain expressive.
LINDA Yeah, I don't wanna look like Boris Karloff.
DOCTOR Uh-huh!
DOCTOR Heh-heh, so you don't want a sex change!
LINDA No, I'm all woman!
Doctor and patient, now dressed, sit on either side of a desk.
DOCTOR So Linda, what we're talking about here is four different procedures.
DOCTOR The liposuction...
DOCTOR The rhinoplasty...
DOCTOR The facial tuck, which I would strongly recommend over the chemical peel----
LINDA Yeah, I don't want to get anything burned off.
DOCTOR And why should you.
DOCTOR With that lovely skin.
DOCTOR And lastly, the breast augmentation.
DOCTOR Now we can also do something about the vaccine scar----I don't know if you wear sleeveless dresses much----
LINDA Not with these ham hocks!
DOCTOR Yes, well once they're nice and svelte, post-op, you----
LINDA Well I don't know.
LINDA Is the vaccine thing----can you counsel me on this?
LINDA I don't know, is it unsightly?
LINDA I see it a lot, a bunch of people have it.
DOCTOR Absolutely!
DOCTOR Some women don't mind it at all!
DOCTOR Personal taste!
Linda Litzke, in a Hardbodies polo shirt with "Linda" stitched on the breast, leans out of her semi-enclosed office on the gym floor.
LINDA Chad!
Chad Feldheimer, trainer, fortyish and well-muscled, has a gym patron up on a table and is helping him stretch a leg back.
PATRON Ow!
CHAD I'm sorry, was that too much?
PATRON I felt a straining...
PATRON a tightness in the...
PATRON in the front of my ass...
CHAD Well you're pretty tight.
CHAD You have to feel it or----
LINDA Chad Feldheimer.
LINDA Office.
CHAD I'll be back in a minute.
CHAD We'll work on opening those hips.
Linda is tapping at her computer as Chad enters.
LINDA I got a batch from BeWithMeDC dot com.
Chad perches on the desk, chewing gum as he gazes at the screen.
CHAD Oh wow.
CHAD Any good?
LINDA I don't know yet, just looking...
LINDA How do you open this?
CHAD Click on, uh...
CHAD yeah...
LINDA Oh my god!
CHAD What?
LINDA Oh my God, what a loser!
She clicks.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) Loser!
She clicks.
Chad is laughing.
Linda scowls.
...
Loser!...
What is this!
They should call this Mr. Saggy dot com.
Cripes.
Loser!
Did you have to send a picture?
No, only guys do.
I submitted a verbal profile, turn-ons, turn-offs, et cetera.
I'm really looking for someone with a sense of humor.
That guy----wait----that guy wasn't bad.
Him?
No, before.
Him?
Yeah.
He uh, he might not be a loser.
How can you tell?
That's a Brioni suit.
Oh yeah?
Shit yeah.
Does he look like he has a sense of humor?
He looks like his optometrist has a sense of humor.
Linda slaps his arm.
CHAD (CONT'D) ...
CHAD (CONT'D) Huh-huh-huh.
CHAD (CONT'D) What does he do?
LINDA State Department.
CHAD That's cool.
LINDA His hair is...
LINDA what is that?
CHAD Plugs.
Linda is showing someone around the floor.
LINDA This is the cardio area.
LINDA A lot of machines here so that, believe me, there's never a wait.
LINDA What you're seeing now, this is our busiest time, and there's still a couple of open treadmills I see, three Stairmasters---- I call it the Butt-Blaster----couple of LifeCycles----Hi, Chad.
Chad is working with a medicine ball and a heavy young woman.
CHAD Hi Linda.
CHAD Did you call that guy?
LINDA Not yet!
LINDA Chad is one of our trainers.
LINDA I've just started internet dating and I got my first look at the, uh...
CUSTOMER What service?
LINDA BeWithMeDC dot com?
CUSTOMER Nice.
LINDA Have you used them?
CUSTOMER No----two friends did and they're both hooked up.
CUSTOMER With really special guys.
LINDA That's fantastic.
Linda is leaning forward at her desk, phone wedged between ear and shoulder, one hand up at her forehead.
After a long still beat:
LINDA Yes!
Another still beat.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) English!
Beat.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) Agent!
Beat.
LINDA DRIVING ...
LINDA DRIVING Agent!
LINDA DRIVING Agent!
Beat.
LINDA ...
LINDA Yes, hi, this is Linda Litzke, should I give you my account number?
LINDA You have it up?
LINDA Okay.
LINDA I was informed that I needed pre-approval for these surgeries, and then...
LINDA Yes, it was denied.
Listening, then:
LINDA (CONT'D) ...No, those are four different operations...
LINDA (CONT'D) It's very complicated; I'm reinventing myself, it's a whole new look so it isn't just one thing, however, it's all approved by my doctor...
LINDA (CONT'D) But----madam!
LINDA (CONT'D) This is not----my job involves, you know, public interface!
LINDA (CONT'D) This is not...
Her jaw sets.
She controls her fury.
Quieter:
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) Yes I do understand.
LINDA (CONT'D) Could I speak to your supervisor please?
We are on a long lens point-of-view, from several cubicles over, of Linda, now slumped at her desk, head in her arms.
We faintly hear her sobbing.
Reverse shows Ted Treffon, middle-aged, balding, the soulful manager of Hardbodies.
He looks at Linda, puzzled and a little alarmed.
He tenses as if to rise but doesn't, and hovers uncomfortably, unsure of whether to intrude.
Linda walks down the promenade dressed in a smart pant suit.
Her moving POV passes over a couple in conversation, an old woman feeding the birds, a man in a business suit reading a newspaper.
She passes the man and turns around.
He has looked up from the paper and is staring at her.
He wears aviator-shaped glasses with clear plastic rims.
He may have hair plugs.
LINDA Alan?
MAN (ALAN) Are you, uh...
MAN (ALAN) Linda?
A poster advertises Totally Stoked!
with Dermot Mulroney and Claire Danes.
On the screen, Dermot Mulroney, dressed in a tuxedo, cranes his head to look steeply up and off.
Linda sits next to Alan in the half-empty theatre, nervously watching the screen.
DERMOT (OFF) First you tell me that you can't commit, then you----WOULD YOU GET DOWN
Linda laughs raucously, then catches herself and looks at Alan.
The couple sit across from each other at a small table.
They pick at their food.
The couple are making love in the dark room on a frilly comforter.
Alan, still wearing his glasses, wheezes asthmatically.
Alan is snoring.
After a long beat Linda gets up and puts on a robe.
She bends down near the bed and picks something up out of Alan's trousers.
She sits into a chair near the window in the dark room and opens Alan's wallet.
A Discover card, driver's license, a condom.
A photograph of Alan holding a large bluefish.
She unfolds a piece of notepaper.
Written in a feminine hand in pencil:
Please pick up: Plunge Honey Nut Cheerios.
LINDA Oh for Pete's sake!
She catches herself, looks around.
The snoring, off, continues.
She looks out the window.
The lights of the freeway twinkle.
We are in the bedroom.
The boat rides gently at anchor.
Harry has an arm around Katie, in bed.
Both stare at a point in space.
After a beat that is silent except for the faint sloshing of water against hull:
HARRY ...
HARRY and then, you know, you grow up.
HARRY I guess that's what's happened with me.
HARRY You just...
HARRY people change.
HARRY We married when I was, what, in my mid- twenties.
HARRY A kid.
HARRY We were kids.
HARRY Twenties.
HARRY You think it's forever.
HARRY Then, you know, you're older----you begin to feel your mortality, you start to think, well, there's no more time for dishonesty.
HARRY Subterfuge.
HARRY You go, I'm not that person.
HARRY The choices you made, you can't, just through inertia----
KATIE I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.
Harry doesn't react----a careful, studied non-reaction.
After more sloshing:
HARRY ...
HARRY I'm just thinking, Whoa.
HARRY I mean, frankly, I'm thinking, Whoa.
HARRY I, I, I guess that's what I should be thinking about too.
HARRY With Sandy.
KATIE That's what you were just saying.
HARRY Yes!
HARRY Absolutely!
HARRY And you should be getting rid of that bozo.
HARRY No question about that.
HARRY I agree.
KATIE So if I were divorced----
HARRY Well yes, if you were uh, you know, yes.
HARRY Yes, I should settle things.
HARRY With Sandy.
HARRY Because of you and me.
HARRY It just takes, courage, you know.
HARRY To inflict that pain.
HARRY Scary stuff.
HARRY (CONT'D) Scary stuff.
HARRY (CONT'D) You're a brave lady.
HARRY (CONT'D) Well, of course, it would be easier for you.
KATIE Why's that?
KATIE I don't see that.
HARRY Well you know, because he's such a dope.
HARRY But Sandy, she's...
HARRY a good lady.
HARRY A very special lady.
KATIE She's a cold, stuck-up bitch.
HARRY Well that's...
HARRY a little----
KATIE You and I should sort things out.
KATIE I've told you that this is not just frivolity.
HARRY No, that's understood.
HARRY You've been very straight.
KATIE I thought I was loud and clear.
HARRY Absolutely.
HARRY Not just fun and games.
Awkward beat.
The sloshing of waves.
Harry nods.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Absolutely.
Harry Pfarrer pulls a length of metal tubing from a shelf.
He sights down it, examines the gauge, hefts it.
He slides it back in and pulls a length, wider gauge, from the shelf below.
Long lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry is pushing a red shopping cart through the parking lot.
Standing in the cart are lengths of metal tubing that he steadies with one hand as he pushes.
Linda has a hand cupped to her forehead and the phone pressed to one ear.
LINDA English!...
LINDA Agent!...
LINDA Agent!...
After a short beat she hits a button on the phone console and cradles the handset.
From the speaker we hear:
RECORDED VOICE ----important to us.
RECORDED VOICE Please stay on the line for the next available agent.
Music.
Linda listens for a moment, then abruptly lifts the handset and slams it back down.
Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies, stands with one hand on the back of his chair----which Chad occupies----and one hand on the desktop, looking over Chad's shoulder at a computer screen that Chad is scrolling down.
Standing behind both men is a short Mexican Indian man, also in a Hardbodies uniform.
CHAD Holy shit...
LINDA Ted, can I talk to you about our Mickey Mouse health plan?
Ted continues to stare at the computer screen in mounting alarm.
He responds absently to Linda:
TED Uh-huh...
TED Hang on...
TED Yellow Revision 8/24/07 31.
CHAD This is some heavy shit.
LINDA Is that my date list?
CHAD No...
CHAD fuck...
LINDA You know, I'm trying to reinvent myself, and these procedures, which are so incredibly not cheap, this Micky Mouse HMO is saying they're not, they're...
LINDA What is this?
She is looking at the screen.
CHAD I can't believe this...
CHAD This is like...
CHAD intelligence shit.
TED I am not comfortable with this.
LINDA What is it?
CHAD This is, like, I can't believe this shit I'm seeing.
TED Manolo found it.
CHAD Manolo found this, like, CD just lying in a locker.
CHAD Locker floor.
CHAD Ladies' locker room.
MANOLO Jus lie-een there.
CHAD And I'm like, whoa, someone's music or what, so I come in here and it's these files, man.
TED I am not comfortable with this.
TED Yellow Revision 8/24/07 32.
CHAD Like it's talking about SigInt, and signals and shit.
CHAD Which, Signals means code, you know.
MANOLO It was jus lie-een there.
CHAD Talking about like, section heads here, and their names and shit.
CHAD And then these other files are just, like, numbers.
CHAD Arrayed.
CHAD Numbers and dates and numbers...
CHAD And numbers.
CHAD I think * that's the shit, man.
CHAD The raw intelligence.
TED I am not touching this.
TED I want this out of here.
CHAD Wul...
CHAD Throw it out?
LINDA You can't do that!
LINDA You should put a note up in the ladies' locker room.
CHAD Put a note up?
CHAD Highly classified shit found, Signals intelligence shit, CIA shit?
CHAD Hello!
CHAD Did you lose your secret CIA shit?
CHAD I don't think so.
TED Look, you figure it out, I am not comfortable with this.
TED I want this * out of Hardbodies...
As he backs out of the office:
TED (CONT'D) ...
TED (CONT'D) We're running a gym here!
Chad swivels around.
CHAD Look, Manolo...
He zippers his lip.
CHAD (CONT'D) ...you didn't find this.
MANOLO I found it on the floor there.
CHAD Yeah, I know, but-
MANOLO Right there on the floor there.
MANOLO Lie- een there.
A dark blue Ford Taurus, three or four car lengths back on a quiet Chevy Chase street.
Harry Pfarrer glances at the rear view mirror.
Behind him we see the steel pipe from Home Depot laying across the top of the back seat of the station wagon.
Harry is just getting out of the wagon which is parked in the driveway of the suburban house.
Harry is struggling through the front door with the length of pipe.
We hear his wife call down from upstairs:
SANDY Harry?
SANDY Is that you?
HARRY Yeah, yeah, it's me.
He takes the pipe, opens the staircase door to the cellar, sets the pipe inside on the upper stair, and closes the door behind him.
Harry is at a workbench welding a length of trimmed pipe to a short piece of hardware clamped in a table vise.
His home shop is in a caged-off section of the basement.
There is also haphazard storage.
Yellow Revision 8/24/07 34.
One shelf holds stacked boxes labeled with magic marker: "Oliver in the Oval Office," "Yea and Nay for Oliver," "Point of Order, Oliver!"
Harry loosens the vise and takes out the piece of hardware.
He drops it, a small bearing-mounted clip, onto a length of pipe held horizontal in another vise.
He experimentally slides the clip along the length of pipe: it slides smoothly back and forth, nicely balanced.
Linda Litzke and Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies, are at a table in the yuppie bar Monkey Dave's.
To a waitress:
LINDA Absolut Saketini, please?
TED Just a Tab.
LINDA You know, it wouldn't cover all of it, but if I got some advance on my salary I could at least get the surgery ball rolling.
TED Whoa!
TED There's a payroll company, you know.
TED They don't just advance people money.
TED They just don't do that.
TED I mean, sure, I could say, Yes, I * authorize it, but that's not going to mean anything to them.
LINDA Well why do they have us on a cockamamie health plan?
LINDA I need these surgeries, Ted!
TED You're a beautiful woman!
TED You don't need-
LINDA Ted, I have gone just as far as I can go with this body!
LINDA I----
TED I think it's a very beautiful----it's not a phoney-baloney Hollywood body----
TED Yellow Revision 8/24/07 35.
LINDA That's right, Ted, I would be laughed out of Hollywood.
LINDA I have very limited breasts and a gi-normous ass and I have this gut that swings back and forth in front a me like a shopping cart with a bent wheel.
TED Oh come on!
LINDA I am trying to get back in circulation.
LINDA I have appetites and so forth, and, uh----
TED Well there's a lot of guys who'd like you just the way you are.
LINDA Yeah----losers!
TED Well, I don't know.
TED Am I a loser?
TED Lemme tell you something.
TED I wasn't always a manager at Hardbodies.
TED I, um...
He looks at her, appraising.
He decides.
TED (CONT'D) * Let me show you something.
He reaches into his wallet.
He pulls out a picture:
A snapshot of a soulful man in a dark robe and a high caftan standing on a curb in front of a large stone building.
Linda shrieks:
LINDA Omygod----is that you?!
Ted nods gravely.
TED Fourteen years, a Greek Orthodox priest.
TED Congregation in Chevy Chase.
LINDA Well jeez, that's a good job!
TED Mm-hm.
LINDA What happened?
TED Well...
He looks at the picture for a sad beat, then shrugs.
He stuffs it back in his wallet.
TED (CONT'D) ...
TED (CONT'D) It's a long story.
TED (CONT'D) Anyway, lotta ways I'm happier now.
TED (CONT'D) My point is...
TED (CONT'D) my point is...
TED (CONT'D) it's a journey.
LINDA Well that's my point!
LINDA I don't want to stay where I am!
LINDA I want to find someone to share my journey!
TED Well, sometimes, you know, you don't look in your own back yard, you're never gonna see----
LINDA That's right!
LINDA That's why I've started this internet dating!
TED Uh-huh, but I'm saying, maybe you don't have to, you know...
TED to----
LINDA Look Ted, I know you can't authorize an advance on my salary but you can put in a request, can't you?
TED It's not going to do any good, Linda.
LINDA Ted, have you ever heard of the power of positive thinking?
It is night.
Linda sleeps in a darkened bedroom under the frilly comforter.
We hear a distant banging.
Finally the banging stops and a moment later the telephone rings.
Linda stirs, wakes and reaches for the bedside phone.
LINDA Hurrow----
She removes an appliance from her mouth.
LINDA (CONT'D) Hello?...
LINDA (CONT'D) Where are you?...
LINDA (CONT'D) Okay.
LINDA (CONT'D) Just a second.
We hear a door being buzzed open.
At the top of the staircase an apartment door opens and Linda appears in a robe.
Her POV down the steep staircase: Chad Feldheimer is walking up towards the landing dressed in a black lycra bicycle unitard with lime green flames.
He holds a bike wheel in one hand and a plastic squirt bottle in the other.
He looks up, foreshortened.
CHAD Omygod.
Chad enters with his bicycle wheel and squirt bottle.
Linda shuts the door behind him.
CHAD Omygod.
LINDA Chad, you know what time it is?
CHAD Uh-huh.
CHAD So, like, I couldn't tell you this on your totally unsecure phone, but I know who the guy is.
He leans his wheel against the wall and sits on a low chair that brings his knees up near his chin.
He looks smugly at Linda.
LINDA The guy?
CHAD The guy, the secret guy.
LINDA Is he high up?
A beat.
Chad stares.
CHAD Um.
CHAD I don't know if he's high up.
CHAD Probably.
CHAD I mean, I know his name, not like his rank.
LINDA What is it?
CHAD Osbourne.
CHAD Cox.
LINDA Never heard of him.
CHAD Oh, like you're so plugged in to the intelligence community.
LINDA I'm just saying, to the layman----
CHAD Well I think like the quality of the intelligence dictates how high up he is.
LINDA Uh-huh.
CHAD Not what we know.
LINDA Uh-huh.
CHAD And I also got his----do you have any water?
CHAD I gotta hydrate.
LINDA I have tap water
CHAD Are you kidding?
LINDA How did you find out who he is?
CHAD Sources.
LINDA What do you mean sources?
CHAD Do you have like Gatorade?
CHAD Anything besides, like, Maryland swamp water?
He rises and heads for the kitchen.
CHAD (CONT'D) ...
CHAD (CONT'D) You know how far this is from my place?
LINDA How do you know his name?
CHAD I have this geek friend, Ernie Gallegos?
CHAD He does computer stuff, hooks up people's computers and programs their VCRs'n shit?
CHAD So he examines the files and he pulls off the digital watermark that tells what computer they were created on.
CHAD Fucking child's play for Ernie.
LINDA Uh-huh.
Chad opens the refrigerator and starts rummaging.
CHAD I also have his telephone number.
CHAD That was a little harder.
LINDA Omygod!
Chad straightens up with a bottle of orange juice which he rolls across his forehead.
CHAD Shall we give him a tinkle?
CHAD Yellow Revision 8/24/07 40.
LINDA Omygod, why?
CHAD Because he's gonna wanna know that his shit is secure.
CHAD You know, he's gonna be relieved.
CHAD He might even be so relieved he gives us a reward----I would be very fucking surprised if he did not.
LINDA Oh, wow.
CHAD Very surprised.
CHAD Like, you know, the * Good Samaritan tax.
CHAD Which is not even a tax, really, since it's voluntary.
Chad is looking at a crumpled piece of notepaper and punching numbers into a wall phone.
In the background we see Linda watching him from the living room couch.
A beat.
We hear the call ring through.
The click of the connection being made, and Chad silently gestures, with an upward sweep of his hand, for Linda to pick up her extension.
CHAD Hello?
He has the phone pressed groggily to his ear.
OSBOURNE Hello?
CHAD Osbourne?
CHAD Osbourne Cox?
OSBOURNE Yes----uh----Who is this?
CHAD Are you...
CHAD uh...
CHAD Osbourne Cox?
OSBOURNE Who is this?
OSBOURNE What time is it?
OSBOURNE Who are you?
CHAD I'm a Good Samaritan.
CHAD I'm sorry I'm calling at such an hour, but I thought you might be worried.
OSBOURNE Worried?
CHAD About the security.
CHAD Of your shit.
A beat.
OSBOURNE What on earth are you talking about?
OSBOURNE Who am I speaking to?
Katie stirs in bed.
KATIE Who is it?
CHAD Your files----your documents.
CHAD I know these documents are sensitive.
CHAD But I am perfectly happy to return to you your sensitive shit.
CHAD At a time of your choosing.
OSBOURNE What documents?
OSBOURNE What are you talking about?
CHAD ...
CHAD Osbourne Cox?
OSBOURNE Yes!
OSBOURNE Yes, I'm Osbourne Cox!
OSBOURNE Who the fuck-
CHAD Settle down, Osbourne.
KATIE Who is that?
OSBOURNE What documents are you talking about?
OSBOURNE Yellow Revision 8/24/07 42.
(referring to his notepaper) OK.
"The bureau chief in Belgrade we * all called Slovak the Butcher.
He had very little report with his staff, and his despatches were marked by----
Ra-por, very little rapport with his staff, you fucking moron!
How did you get----
Don't blow a gasket, Osbourne.
I have----
How did you get a hold of that!
It's not important where I----
You're in way over your fucking head!
Who the fuck are you?
You have no idea what you're doing!
Oh!
Why so uptight, Osbourne Cox?
I'm just a Good Samaritan, like, a traveler on the road who has happened upon----
We're going to return it, we just thought----
Linda, I'll do it!
Who's this?!
Ozzie, what is going on.
Like a Good Samaritan tax----
Who the fuck----
CHAD You know, this is a major inconvenience for us and we thought, you know, a reward----
OSBOURNE So it's money!
OSBOURNE So it's money!
CHAD Well, yeah, uh...
CHAD why not?
CHAD I mean, this is not----am I out of line here?
OSBOURNE All right, you two clowns listen to me very very carefully.
OSBOURNE I don't know who you are, but I warn you most emphatically----
LINDA You warn us?
LINDA You warn us?
LINDA You know what, Mr., Mr. Intelligence?
LINDA We warn you!
LINDA We'll call you back with our demands!
She slams down the phone.
CHAD Hello?
CHAD We just----
OSBOURNE Who, who----
LINDA Chad!
LINDA Don't play his game!
OSBOURNE Hello!
OSBOURNE Hello!
CHAD Sorry.
He walks back into the living room shaking his head.
CHAD (CONT'D) ...
CHAD (CONT'D) Geeze...
LINDA The nerve of that guy!
CHAD ...
CHAD I am very fucking surprised he did not give us the reward.
Osbourne sits on the edge of his bed in the dark room, shaking his head.
KATIE What in God's name is going on?
OSBOURNE There's some clown----a couple of clowns ----somehow got a hold of my memoir----
KATIE Your what?
OSBOURNE Stole it or----I have no idea how they got it----
KATIE Your what?
OSBOURNE My memoir, the book I'm writing.
KATIE Why in God's name would they think that's worth anything.
OSBOURNE Well they----I...
OSBOURNE I've no idea how they got it.
Chad paces, shaking his head.
CHAD But it doesn't sound like he's gonna play ball.
LINDA Oh, he'll play ball!
LINDA We just have to let him know who's boss.
CHAD Well, that's----he sounds very senior.
CHAD I think this is some senior guy who has screwed the pooch, big-time.
CHAD Blue Revision 8/1/07 45.
LINDA Yeah, that's why we got him, you know, we've caught him with his thing caught in a big fat wringer.
CHAD Yuh-huh.
LINDA And us in the driver's seat.
LINDA This is our opportunity, like, you don't get many of these.
LINDA You slip on the ice outside of, you know, a fancy restaurant.
CHAD Yuh-huh.
LINDA Or this happens.
CHAD Right.
LINDA And right now this has happened.
CHAD Yup.
CHAD It sure has.
LINDA This could put a big dent in my surgeries.
CHAD Big time.
We are dutch on her as she leans down a staircase, one hand on its rail, calling to be heard over the buzz of a bandsaw:
SANDY Honey!
No answer.
The bandsaw whines higher, cutting through steel.
Louder:
SANDY (CONT'D) Honey!
SANDY (CONT'D) Blue Revision 8/1/07 46.
The whine hums down.
HARRY'S VOICE Huh?
SANDY My cab is here, I'm off.
SANDY Mystery man.
Her point-of-view: down the stairs, oddly cropped by the angles of dropped ceiling and walls, we see Harry's lower body as he throws a drape over his project.
He emerges from the shop cage and closes its mesh door and padlocks it.
SANDY (CONT'D) ...
SANDY (CONT'D) What is that thing?
HARRY Oh baby.
HARRY Top secret.
He comes up the stairs, pushing goggles onto his forehead.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) You're gonna knock 'em dead.
At the top of the stairs he kisses her.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) How many cities?
SANDY Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago.
He picks up her bag and they go out.
HARRY Why do they always have you do Seattle.
HARRY Not a big market.
SANDY I don't know, lots of independent bookstores.
SANDY Rains all day, what are people gonna do.
HARRY I can think of a couple of things.
SANDY You can think of one thing.
They are walking to a black Town Car idling curbside.
Pink Revision 8/14/07 47.
SANDY It better be the Peninsula.
SANDY The money I make for them.
SANDY Are you gonna be okay?
HARRY I'll be sad.
HARRY But I'll be okay.
SANDY Not too sad..
HARRY Just the right amount.
He kisses her.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) I am crazy about you, baby.
He slams the car door after her.
As the car pulls out his look travels with it and then lingers up the street, caught on:
A Ford Taurus, parked, dark.
Harry hesitates, then starts walking up the street towards the parked car.
When he has taken several steps the ignition is turned in the car.
A shape briefly visible in the driver's seat is lost when the headlights flash on.
The car pulls out from the curb into a U-turn and drives away.
Harry watches the tail lights recede.
Twisting a gold cufflink like a worry bead.
Wider shows the attorney Bogus Terikhian at a conference table in a book- lined room.
BOGUS Tony Bennett, Toni Morrison and Zoe * Caldwell.
BOGUS It was marvelous.
BOGUS First * time I've attended the Kennedy Honors.
BOGUS Jane Alexander is a client.
BOGUS Old * friend of Zoe's.
BOGUS What an actress.
BOGUS * Anyway...
He leans forward and presses a button on his phone console.
Pink Revision 8/14/07 48.
BOGUS (CONT'D) ...
BOGUS (CONT'D) Connie, could you bring in your copy of the Cox financials?
The secretary rummages through a gym bag that has the Hardbodies logo.
There are gym clothes among the odds and ends.
She picks up her handset.
SECRETARY I thought I had it here on a disk----I don't know where the disk is.
SECRETARY I'm sorry, I'll have to run another off my hard drive.
Bogus is leaning back, expansive.
BOGUS Tony sang "The Best Is Yet To Come."
BOGUS * Mr. Bennett.
He projects toward the phone:
BOGUS (CONT'D) Yeah, okay.
BOGUS (CONT'D) So.
BOGUS (CONT'D) We've drawn up the papers and are prepared to execute service on Osbourne if you so elect, Mrs. Cox.
BOGUS (CONT'D) Our missiles are pointed at his capital, so to speak, and we await only your word.
BOGUS (CONT'D) But, be mindful, madam: once these missiles are launched, there is no recalling them.
BOGUS (CONT'D) We are not picking daisies.
BOGUS (CONT'D) We are declaring war, and hostilities will then impose their own logic.
BOGUS (CONT'D) I think you understand what I'm saying.
KATIE It'll piss Ozzie off.
BOGUS Mm-hm.
KATIE Mr. Terikhian, I have given my husband second chances galore.
KATIE There are limits to my charity.
BOGUS Of course.
BOGUS But since we are at the point of no return, I always urge my clients at this juncture to give it one more day of reflection.
KATIE Yes.
KATIE Understood.
Linda walks down the promenade, dressed in a smart pant suit.
Her moving POV passes over people relaxing in the park: a mother with a stroller, kids running with a ball.
Her look settles on the bench that formerly held her first date, now occupied by:
A man spitting sunflower seeds.
Harry Pfarrer.
The point-of-view arcs past him as Linda gives him the once- over.
She doubles back.
LINDA Harry?
LINDA I'm Linda.
Harry and Linda eat with appetite as they talk.
HARRY Yeah, I did the whole bodyguard thing for years.
HARRY My guy was in State, the Secretary in fact, so of course I traveled a lot.
Harry talks into his sleeve-cuff as if into a radio transmitter:
HARRY (CONT'D) ..."
HARRY (CONT'D) Ironside is leaving the building."
HARRY (CONT'D) We called him Iron Ass.
Linda cackles.
Pink Revision 8/14/07 50.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Not to his face, of course.
HARRY (CONT'D) Not to his ass, either!
Linda cackles again; Harry smiles.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Ah, he was okay.
HARRY (CONT'D) But, Personal Protection----that's a young man's game.
LINDA You wanna try these dumplings?
LINDA They're * delicious.
HARRY Sure...
He reaches but hesitates.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Does it have shellfood in it?
LINDA Shellfood?
HARRY `Cause I have this sensitivity.
HARRY I, uh, * go into anaphylactic shock.
HARRY My larynx * swells up, closes off the----Ah what the * hell.
He spears a dumpling: *
HARRY (CONT'D) * Live dangerously---- *
Through a mouthful: *

HARRY (CONT'D) * Can't always wear a condom.
Linda cackles.
LINDA That's right!
LINDA Not always!
HARRY Anyway, my job's more administrative * now, not so much PP.
HARRY Personal * Protection.
HARRY Though I still carry the gun.
LINDA Omygod, really!

HARRY (CONT'D) in a situation where your man is threatened the training kicks in.
HARRY (CONT'D) Muscle memory.
HARRY (CONT'D) Reflex----Those are outrageous.
He stabs another dumpling off Linda's plate.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Wanna swap?
LINDA No way!
Linda swings the door open, leading Harry in.
Harry talks as he looks appraisingly around the apartment.
HARRY ----but there was just a hell of a lot of political infighting, petty, petty, shit, and then basically the old man stepped on Goldberger's throat.
HARRY Nice...
He is evaluating the place.
He stamps on the floor.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Wide-plank pine?
LINDA I guess.
Harry is taking off his coat.
HARRY Listen, full disclosure here Linda...
He holds up both hands and waggles the fingers.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) I'm not wearing a wedding ring but I am married.
HARRY (CONT'D) Took the ring off, what, eighteen months ago when we agreed to separate.
HARRY (CONT'D) Agreed to disagree.
HARRY (CONT'D) That's about the only thing we ever agreed on.
Linda cackles.
LINDA Thanks for telling me.
LINDA I really do appreciate it, Harry.
HARRY Well, full transparency, the only way to----
As Linda passes he grabs and embraces her.
Linda reacts to his gun in the shoulder holster:

HARRY Well let's go in the other room and find out!

LINDA He's very very communicative.
LINDA Very accessible.
LINDA He has a sense of humor.
LINDA And he agrees one hundred percent about my surgeries.

A rattling knock.
Linda looks over:
Chad Feldheimer, in his trainer's polo shirt, is knocking on the cubicle window.
He gestures urgently for her to come out.
Behind Hardbodies.
Linda and Chad emerge from the health club through a heavy back door.
LINDA No, you can't go like that!
LINDA You gotta wear a suit.
CHAD Well----you mean----go home and change?
LINDA Yeah!
CHAD I was gonna ride my bike.
CHAD Do I have time?
Harry and Katie are at a downtown D.C. restaurant in the middle of lunch.
KATIE ----which to my mind is all the more reason to lower the boom on Ozzie.
HARRY Mm.
KATIE That's it?
KATIE "Mm"?
HARRY I'm just...
HARRY wondering if it's the right time.
KATIE Of course it's the right time.
KATIE Why wouldn't it be the right time.
KATIE Does it threaten you?
HARRY No no.
HARRY No, you and me are rock solid.
HARRY That's why I, uh, I think we can afford to be big.
HARRY We can think about Ozzie, whether maybe we should let him get himself together a little before you hammer him with, um----
KATIE Is that how you see me, "hammering" him?
HARRY Of course not, but----
KATIE Weren't those your words?
HARRY Yes, but----
KATIE I don't "hammer."
HARRY No, uh-huh, of course not.
HARRY But, I'm saying----I'm no friend of the guy.
HARRY You know that.
HARRY I think he's an arrogant little geek.
HARRY But for Christ sakes, you and me have all the time in the world, and he just lost his job----
KATIE He didn't lose it, he quit.
HARRY Yeah.
HARRY Most of the people who "quit" in this town were fired.
Katie looks at Harry, reckoning.
He returns her look with an open one.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) I feel sorry for the guy.
HARRY (CONT'D) And he'll be easier to deal with when he doesn't feel...
HARRY (CONT'D) cornered.
KATIE Maybe.
KATIE As long as we're talking about Ozzie and not you.
HARRY Of course we're talking about Ozzie.
HARRY Baby, I stand by you whatever you do.
HARRY I adore you.
She nods, thinking, still gazing at him.
Her cell phone chirps and she reaches into her purse.
KATIE Please get the check.
She flips open the phone.
KATIE (CONT'D) ...Yes?...
KATIE (CONT'D) Yes?...
KATIE (CONT'D) Is there blood in his stool?...Yes, soon.
She looks at her watch, rises.
KATIE (CONT'D) It's after two.
KATIE (CONT'D) I have to get back to work.
Harry rises to kiss her.
HARRY I love you so much.
Showing 2:20.
Wider shows Osbourne Cox, sitting in a car parked on a downtown street, consulting his watch.
He looks up, irritated, and glances around.
His look is arrested by:
The side-view mirror.
It shows a man approaching on bicycle along the sidewalk wearing a suit and a bike helmet.
The man dismounts several paces behind the parked car, locks his bike to a fence separating the sidewalk from a small park, and takes off his helmet.
It is Chad.
He walks along the sidewalk to the car, opens the passenger door and sits in with his bike helmet clamped under one arm.
CHAD Osbourne Cox?
OSBOURNE And you, I take it, are "Mr.
OSBOURNE Black"?
CHAD Yes I am.
CHAD You have the money?
OSBOURNE The fifty-thousand dollars.
CHAD That's what was agreed upon, Osbourne Cox.
OSBOURNE All right.
OSBOURNE Let me explain something to you, "Mr.
OSBOURNE Black."
OSBOURNE You know who I am; I know who you are.
CHAD Perhaps.
CHAD But appearances can be---- deceptive.
OSBOURNE Yeah.
OSBOURNE What you're engaged in is blackmail, which is a felony.
OSBOURNE That's for starters.
CHAD Appearances can be----deceptive.
CHAD I am a mere Good Samar----
OSBOURNE Secondly, the unauthorized dissemination of classified material is a federal crime.
OSBOURNE If you ever carried out your proposed threat, you would experience such a shitstorm of consequences, my friend, it would make your empty little head spin faster than your Schwinn bicycle over there.
Chad chuckles.
CHAD You think that's a Schwinn?
OSBOURNE Now give me the fucking floppy or the CD or whatever the fuck you have it on, and I will----
CHAD As soon as you give me the money, dickwad!
CHAD I'm not----Huhgf!
Osbourne has punched him in the nose.
Chad stares at him, stunned.
His nose starts bleeding.
CHAD (CONT'D) ...
CHAD (CONT'D) You fuck!
OSBOURNE Give it to me, fuck!
CHAD You fuck!
CHAD You fucker!
He opens the car door and gets out, hand to his nose.
He slams the door.
As Chad goes over to his bike Osbourne leans across the front seat and cranks down the passenger window to bellow:
OSBOURNE I know who you are, fucker!
He pulls out.
CHAD You're the fucker!
There is the honk of a car horn----not Osbourne's.
Chad looks, surprised.
Linda is pulling up.
Her passenger window rolls down.
LINDA Where's the money?
CHAD He hit me!
LINDA Where's the money?!
CHAD He didn't give it to me-
LINDA Oh, for----Get in!
LINDA Chad does.
CHAD That fucker!
He is thrown back against the seat as Linda floors it.
Recovering:
CHAD ...
CHAD Hey----what're you----
CHAD Linda is coming up fast behind Osbourne's car in traffic.
CHAD (CONT'D) Oh shit!
CHAD (CONT'D) The crash of impact----ramming Osbourne.
He recoils from the impact.
OSBOURNE Holy fucking----you fucking morons!
The follow car is speeding up again----but it doesn't hit him.
It swerves out, screeching, to pass, and Linda angrily flips him the finger as she speeds by.
LINDA That'll give him something to think about.
LINDA Chad is chuckling.
LINDA Suddenly he sobers.
CHAD Wait, wait!
CHAD We gotta go back!
CHAD Linda's jaw is set.
CHAD The car is ripping through traffic.
CHAD Yellow Revision 8/24/07 59.
LINDA I knew this would happen.
CHAD We gotta go back!
CHAD My bike!
LINDA It's on to Plan B.
CHAD It's just a Kryptonite lock----you can open those fuckers with a Bic pen!
LINDA Heavens sakes----
CHAD Where we going?
CHAD My bike!
LINDA Some people!
LINDA A skidding turn sends his weight against the door, and the car lurches to a halt.
CHAD ...
CHAD What is this?
LINDA Russian Embassy.
CHAD'S POV THRU WINDSHIELD The hulking embassy building.
Linda stands before a reception desk.
Chad is just behind her, his shirt front spotted with blood and his head tipped back with one hand pressing a hankie to his nose.
His bike helmet is clamped under his other arm.
LINDA I told Mr. Krapkin I might be stopping * by?
CHAD Is there a men's room?
Linda and Chad sit in, Chad with a moistened hand-towel now pressed to his nose.
Behind the desk sits a sixtyish Russian functionary with the beetle-browed sphynx-like look of the Brezhnev-era bureaucrat.
This is Krapotkin.
KRAPOTKIN ----Not exactly.
KRAPOTKIN I am assistant cultural attache.
KRAPOTKIN The organs of state security are not allowed to function within the borders of your country.
LINDA ...
LINDA The organs of state security?
KRAPOTKIN Yes.
LINDA But if I had, oh, say, secrets of a highly, um, secrets that would interest the organs of state security...
She trails off, nodding encouragingly at Krapotkin.
Krapotkin looks blankly back.
A long beat.
KRAPOTKIN Yes.
She rummages in her handbag and pulls out the diskette.
She holds it aloft, waggling it for Krapotkin.
Krapotkin stares.
Linda sets the diskette on the table and slides it across.
LINDA ...
LINDA This is just a taste.
After a beat of looking at the proffered diskette, Krapotkin leans forward to take it.
Linda smiles.
Krapotkin turns the diskette over a couple of times, looks sadly up.
KRAPOTKIN May I ask the source of this...
Linda slowly shakes her head, eyes locked on Krapotkin.
Yellow Revision 8/24/07 61.
LINDA No you may not.
CHAD Very high up.
LINDA Chad!
CHAD I'm just saying he's high up!
A large drop of blood has gathered at the tip of Chad's nose.
It now drops onto his shirt.
Silence.
Finally:
KRAPOTKIN PC or Meck?
LINDA Um.
LINDA PC.
KRAPOTKIN Could you wait please?
He rises.
LINDA Well----
She looks anxiously at her watch.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) I have a date----
Krapotkin leaves.
When the door closes behind him:
LINDA (CONT'D) * The fish.
LINDA (CONT'D) * Has bitten.
CHAD * What?
CHAD * Oh, yeah.
CHAD * Yeah, he seems cool.
A long beat.
Linda looks at her watch.
Chad sighs.
CHAD (CONT'D) ...
CHAD (CONT'D) That fucker really hit me.
Chad is slumped back with his head tilted back.
Linda looks at her watch.
The door opens.
A man in a suit:
MAN Could you accompany me please?
LINDA Well----okay...
The three people----Linda, Chad, the man in the suit----walking.
Linda gazes around; Chad has his head mostly back.
Vladimir Putin glares down from a framed photograph on the wall.
Chad and Linda are sitting before yet another man, even blander than the first.
NEW EMBASSY MAN Can you tell me where this material comes from?
Linda makes a pantomime of zipping her lip.
The man looks at her impassively.
CHAD Name, rank and serial number.
The Russian's focus shifts to the man with the bloody nose:
NEW EMBASSY MAN Excuse me?
CHAD We, um...
CHAD we know our rights.
The man stares at him.
A beat.
LINDA This is just a taste.
The man's look swings back to the woman for another staring beat.
At length:
Yellow Revision 8/24/07 63.
NEW EMBASSY MAN There is more material?
LINDA There's a lot more.
LINDA But we need to be paid.
NEW EMBASSY MAN You are not ideological.
A beat.
CHAD I don't think so.
LINDA Look, I have a date.
NEW EMBASSY MAN Hm?
Linda holds up her watch and taps at it:
LINDA Date.
The man sighs.
NEW EMBASSY MAN ...
NEW EMBASSY MAN We will examine the material.
NEW EMBASSY MAN How do I contact?
LINDA We work at the Hardbodies in Alexandria.
CHAD I'm at 1442 Westerly----
LINDA Chad, not your home address!
Beat.
NEW EMBASSY MAN So...
NEW EMBASSY MAN I call Hardbodies, I ask for...
NEW EMBASSY MAN Chad?
LINDA No.
LINDA Linda.
Point-of-view from a car pulling into Hardbodies.
Ted Treffon, the soulful manager, stands on the sidewalk in front of the gym, squinting into the approaching car, his arms out to either side, palms up: what the hell is going on?
Minutes later.
TED A line to check in, towels piling up.
LINDA I'm sorry.
TED Manolo running around like crazy----what happened to your nose?
CHAD I just----
TED This is not acceptable at Hardbodies.
TED You two know better than that.
LINDA Yes we do.
LINDA I'm sorry, Ted.
TED This is no way.
CHAD It was unavoidable.
CHAD This won't happen again.
A considering beat.
TED But you won't tell me what's going on.
LINDA We can't.
LINDA I...
LINDA I...
LINDA Ted, I know this is terrible, but----I have to run.
LINDA I have a date.
Ted looks at her dolefully.
TED You're changing, Linda.
TED Blue Revision 8/1/07 65.
He shakes his head.
TED (CONT'D) ...
TED (CONT'D) Very sad.
The car is parked in the driveway of the Cox townhouse, its back crumpled.
Reverse shows Katie, looking at it, furious, her jaw set.
Katie marches in the door.
KATIE Ozzie!
KATIE Goddamnit, Ozzie, what have you done to the car?!
Silence.
Katie enters.
KATIE Ozzie!
Osbourne, lightly sheened by sweat, is in the easy chair in his robe, his microcassette recorder under the hand splayed across his chest.
Amber fluid puddles a glass on the side table.
Osbourne snores softly.
Katie's fury mounts.
She visibly fights it down.
KATIE (CONT'D) ...
KATIE (CONT'D) All right.
KATIE (CONT'D) All right.
In Harry Pfarrer's house.
Harry stands before the mirror humming as he meticulously trims his eyebrow hair with a Hoffritz scissors.
We hear his phone ringing, then the answering machine:
HARRY'S VOICE Sandy and I aren't here to take your call.
HARRY'S VOICE Please leave a message.
HARRY'S VOICE Blue Revision 8/1/07 66.
After a beep:
KATIE'S VOICE Can I see you please.
KATIE'S VOICE Harry, please call me.
KATIE'S VOICE I'm very upset.
Harry continues to hum, trimming his eyebrows.
The machine beeps off.
Harry walks into the living room.
He takes some as-yet- unfolded packing boxes and strews them with studied randomness across the floor.
As he does so we hear a cell phone chirp.
Harry fishes the phone out of his pocket and holds it at arm's length, squinting at the number.
Still humming, he stuffs the phone back in his pocket.
Linda meets Harry with a kiss.
LINDA I'm sorry----am I late?
HARRY No no, doesn't start for five minutes.
He is escorting to a movie theater entrance.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) You haven't seen this, have you?
LINDA Oh!
LINDA No, no I haven't.
Our follow-move brings in a light box displaying the one- sheet for Totally Stoked!
with Dermot Mulroney and Claire Danes.
As they tail out of frame:
HARRY I hear it's terrific.
On the screen, Dermot Mulroney, dressed in a tuxedo, cranes his head to look steeply up and off.
DERMOT First you tell me that you can't commit, then you----WOULD YOU GET DOWN
Along with Linda, Harry laughs raucously, tossing popcorn into his mouth.
The door swings in and Harry and Linda enter.
Harry refers to the boxes littering the floor:
HARRY Pardon our dust, I, uh----the ex is in the process of moving out.
HARRY Damn!
HARRY I told her I wanted to expedite this.
LINDA Uh-huh.
HARRY We, uh, you know you try to act like an adult.
LINDA Oh, it's never easy.
HARRY Oh!
HARRY Come on downstairs.
HARRY Do you like surprises?
LINDA Well, I'm very open to new experiences...
The overhead light is switched on.
As Harry and Linda come down the stairs:
HARRY I gotta tell ya----I saw an ad for this in a gentleman's magazine----twelve hundred bucks.
HARRY I take a look at this thing, I think, Jesus, you gotta be kidding----I'm a hobbyist, this is basically nothing but speed-rail, I could probably go to Home Depot and whip this up myself for, like, a hundred bucks...
He sweeps the drop-cloth off his project.
It looks like a rowing machine, though with a higher seat.
Its function is obscure.
LINDA ...
LINDA What is it?
HARRY What is it.
HARRY You siddown, feet in the stirrups, and...
He pushes the seat with his foot.
It slides forward then back, forward and back, rocking.
On its forward arc a dildo emerges from the center of the seat's pipe-track, angled toward the seat-bottom which is cleft to accommodate its entrance.
A long beat as the seat squeaks back and forth, the dildo rhythmically bobbing up and down.
At length:
LINDA Omygod!
Another couple of cycles.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) It's fantastic!
HARRY Isn't that somethin'?
HARRY Hundred bucks all-in if you don't count my labor.
HARRY And the, you know----cost of the dildo.
HARRY Those things are not cheap.
LINDA Uh-uh.
HARRY But I lack the, uh, I'm not set up to mold hard rubber.
Both stare at the rocking love seat:
Squeak.
Squeak.
Squeak.
Sitting in a bar booth, staring, incredulous.
OSBOURNE ...
OSBOURNE The Russians?
Across from him, a man of Osbourne's age.
MAN (HAL) Uh-huh.
OSBOURNE The Russians?
HAL Uh-huh.
HAL Russian Embassy, yeah.
Osbourne stares.
OSBOURNE ...
OSBOURNE You're sure?
HAL Hey, the guy was not hard to follow.
HAL As you know.
OSBOURNE Why the FUCK would they go to the Russians?!
The man responds only with a shrug and a commiserating head- shake.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Why the FUCK...
Osbourne struggles to compose himself.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Thank you, Hal.
HAL Hey.
HAL No problemo.
He leans in, voice lowered.
HAL (CONT'D) ...
HAL (CONT'D) Ozzie, I hate to be the paranoid old spook, but those two guys seem very interested in you.
Osbourne looks.
HAL (CONT'D) ...You haven't gone poofy on me, have ya Oz?
There are two men with drinks at a booth.
At Osbourne's look one of them, who has been staring, looks hastily away.
OSBOURNE Can I help you?
The man meets his look again.
He smiles, rises, ambles over.
MAN (PROCESS SERVER) Sorry to stare, I just couldn't place the...
MAN (PROCESS SERVER) You're Princeton, aren't you?
MAN (PROCESS SERVER) My year?
MAN (PROCESS SERVER) '73?
OSBOURNE Yeah.
PROCESS SERVER I just didn't remember your...
Osbourne extends a hand.
OSBOURNE Osbourne Cox.
PROCESS SERVER Thought so.
He smiles as he deposits a large manila envelope in Osbourne's extended hand.
PROCESS SERVER (CONT'D) ...
PROCESS SERVER (CONT'D) Served...
He nods toward his companion, watching from the booth.
PROCESS SERVER (CONT'D) ...
PROCESS SERVER (CONT'D) and witnessed.
PROCESS SERVER (CONT'D) Have a good evening.
The man walks off; his friend hastily knocks back the rest of his drink and rises to follow him.
Osbourne stares stupidly at the envelope in his hand.
HAL Ouch.
Night.
Rain.
The car corners into a driveway and its headlights rake the front of the Cox townhouse, which is dark.
A couple of pieces of luggage and several cardboard boxes are stacked on the stoop, most of them protected from the rain by the eave but some not.
OSBOURNE'S VOICE What the fuck?
The car stops.
Osbourne emerges, runs through the rain to the front stoop.
Rain drums against cardboard.
OSBOURNE What the fuck?
He puts his key in the lock and----it doesn't turn.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Fucking...
He nudges a cardboard box with his toe.
He looks up at the dark house, squinting against the rain.
Linda and Chad sit at the counter, Linda drinking a large protein shake, Chad idly twirling a straw wrapper around one finger.
CHAD Why did you tell him we could get more stuff?
LINDA Well maybe we can.
CHAD That's all Manolo found!
CHAD That was everything!
CHAD What're we, gonna tell Manolo to scoop some more secret shit off the locker room floor!
LINDA Hey!
LINDA Yellow Revision 8/24/07 72.
What.
I don't like the snideness!
Nor the * negativity!
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to work this thing!
If I'm going to reinvent myself I need those surgeries.
And those surgeries cost money!
This is not just fun and games!
Yuh-huh.
I'm sorry.
So let's figure this thing out!
Chad, your Berry Blast is ready.
We know who he is
Right: Osbourne Cox.
So we can find out where he lives, right?
Um.
I guess.
You should change.
Into your suit.
Why?
So you don't look out of place in the neighborhood.
There are certain elementary things.
His neighborhood?
Yellow Revision 8/24/07 73.
LINDA Yes.
LINDA We'll remove the laundry marks and labels.
LINDA And you should not be carrying ID.
CHAD Laundry marks?
LINDA Deniability.
CHAD Okay.
PUBLIC ADDRESS Chad, your Berry Blast is waiting.
A car is pulling into the driveway.
Katie Cox emerges from the driver's side.
Reverse shows Chad, in his suit, watching from a parked car across the street.
Now Harry Pfarrer emerges from the passenger side wearing a brown pin-striped suit.
Encumbered by something bulky he follows Katie up the walk.
It seems to be some kind of pillow or cushion under his arm, but very large, and wedge-shaped.
Katie is letting herself in; Harry gives a furtive glance around----as Chad sinks back in his car seat----before entering with the wedge-cushion.
The door closes.
Chad relaxes, straightens up.
A beat.
He looks idly around.
He notices:
Another car, parked on the same side of the street, further up.
Someone is just straightening from a slouch to become visible over the driver's headrest.
Chad looks, puzzled.
Chad is sucking the dregs of his Jamba Juice up a straw when a noise brings his look around:
The door to the townhouse is opening.
Katie emerges, in a change of clothes.
Harry follows in sweats.
They get into her car.
It pulls out.
Chad watches it go up the street.
He is about to open his door but pauses, seeing:
The parked car up the street.
Katie's car having passed, it now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance.
Both cars disappear.
Chad opens his door and gets out.
He is crossing to the townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other side of the street.
A man sits in the driver's seat, smoking.
Chad proceeds on to the house.
There is a barred garden- level door tucked under the stoop.
Chad checks out the caging on the door.
He looks up the facade of the house.
It pulls over at one end of the Potomac bridge that we have seen before.
Harry emerges.
HARRY What's the odometer say?
KATIE Five.
HARRY About five or approximately five?
HARRY I mean----about f----
KATIE For fuck's sake, Harry, it's five miles.
KATIE Five point two.
HARRY Okay, fine----I gotta do at least five.
HARRY Five and a deuce is okay.
KATIE I'm surprised you have any energy left.
HARRY You kiddin'----pull around the corner we'll do it again in back!
KATIE You are very coarse.
HARRY No, back of the car.
HARRY I didn't mean a rear-entry, uh----
KATIE Ach.
KATIE I'm late----
KATIE The car squeals away, leaving Harry on the shoulder.
Chad is cornering the house on the driveway side, appraising.
A low wall separates driveway from back garden.
Chad gives a quick glance around.
Chad vaults the wall to land in the garden.
The garden steps down to a back door.
Chad checks out the windows in back, then goes to the door.
It is locked.
It has a large window.
We can see Chad's form outside the door.
Its pane is tapped once...
twice...
it breaks.
HARRY JOGGING He spins, jogs backward.
HARRY JOGGING His point-of-view: a car, traveling slowly.
HARRY JOGGING Following?
HARRY JOGGING Harry cuts across a park lawn.
Chad is nosing around the basement.
He notices Ozzie's office set-up.
HARRY Emerging from the park onto another street.
HARRY He looks around and, satisfied that he has lost the tail, jogs on.
Chad is looking at the screen of Ozzie's computer.
He fishes a CD out of his suit pocket, feeds it into the computer.
HARRY Jogging, entering a residential area.
Chad is emerging from the basement.
He is looking idly around, heading toward the front door when a shape materializes in its frosted glass sidelight.
Chad freezes.
There is scraping at the lock.
Chad quickly mounts the stairs.
Chad freezes, listening.
The downstairs door swings open, shut.
Footsteps.
A tread on the stairs: Chad scurries into the first open door.
Chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the way shut.
The footsteps mount the stairs.
Chad peeks out.
His POV: The bed, bedclothes rumpled.
In the middle of the bed, a wedge-cushion.
Beyond, the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and stairs.
Harry arrives at the top of the stairs.
He nudges back a drape on the window at the top of the steps.
He looks down one way, then the other.
He lets the drape fall back and seems to relax.
Harry enters the bedroom.
He strips off his shirt and steps out of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master bedroom.
He leaves the door open.
Chad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but stops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the curtain whipped back.
Harry emerges from the shower.
He rinses off, humming "Born Free," and walks into the foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress pants that was draped across a bureau.
Chad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches.
Harry stops, just outside the cracked door.
Through the crack we see only the white of his shirt.
Abruptly Harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room and bends to pick something off the floor.
Chad leans in ever so slightly to see, but draws back again as Harry approaches.
Chad looks over to his right: on a hanger, the brown pinstripe coat that matches Harry's pants.
The closet door is thrown open.
CHAD Nuhhh!
Harry jerks up the gun which he's pulled from the shoulder holster in his other hand and----BAM----shoots Chad in the face.
The gun bucks.
Unused to the recoil and still screaming, Harry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and drops the weapon.
He crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles off on all fours.
In the hallway he rises and tramples down the stairs.
He stops at the bottom of the steps, panting.
He looks back up the steps, trying to control his heavy breathing so that he can listen.
A long silence.
HARRY ...
HARRY Hello?
HARRY No answer.
HARRY He looks around.
Harry enters.
He opens a drawer, closes it, opens another.
Harry enters from the kitchen and starts slowly mounting the stairs, a chopping knife in one hand.
HARRY ...
HARRY Hello?
Harry tops the stairs.
He pauses, looking at:
The bedroom door, ajar.
Inside, his gun lies on the floor.
Harry takes cautious steps toward the door.
He pauses at the cracked door.
Suddenly:
HARRY Hungh!
HARRY He plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops it, dropping the knife.
HARRY He stands and spins, panting.
HARRY His point-of-view: the closet.
HARRY Its door ajar.
HARRY Legs protrude into the room as if Chad, hidden within, is sitting with his back against the closet wall contemplating his next move.
Harry walks cautiously over.
With a bare foot he experimentally waggles one of Chad's feet.
Limp.
Harry nudges the door.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Hello?
It creaks fully open.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Omygod.
HARRY (CONT'D) Omygod.
Chad's face is a powder-burned, chewed-up mess.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Omygod who are you.
HARRY (CONT'D) You fucker.
HARRY (CONT'D) Omygod.
He gingerly crouches down.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) You fucker...
He tries to avert his eyes as he feels in Chad's suit pockets.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Omygod, my god...
HARRY (CONT'D) Ungh...
He comes away with a wallet and hastily stands.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Omygod...
Inside are a few dollars and nothing else: no credit cards, driver's license; empty.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) What the fuck...
He leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason feeling obliged to return the wallet.
As he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside pocket he notices:
The suit label has been cut away.
He fingers the raveled fringe.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Oh my fuck...
He straightens up again.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) I killed a fucking spook.
HARRY (CONT'D) You fucker...
HARRY (CONT'D) He gazes down at the body.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) What are you doing here, you fucker.
We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of someone walking down the well polished hallway.
We are low, outside an office door.
The shoes enter frame and the door is swung inward, away from us, to show Palmer DeBakey Smith seated behind his desk.
He looks up.
PALMER Olson.
PALMER What's up.
PALMER The door slams shut.
Some time later.
Our camera position is higher.
At the cut the door swings open and Palmer Smith strides out, grim-faced.
Tracking behind his shoes down a different piece of hallway.
Palmer Smith's back enters and he swings the door open.
A silver-haired man looks up from his desk where he is leaned back, eating orange sections off a paper towel on the desktop.
MAN Palmer.
MAN What's up.
PALMER Not quite certain, sir, but it's...
PALMER messy.
He seats himself facing the desk.
A desktop nameplate identifies his superior as Gardner McC.
Chubb.
Palmer hands a folder across, grimacing.
PALMER (CONT'D) ...
PALMER (CONT'D) Kolyma-2 tells us that they have computer files from an ex-analyst of mine, Osbourne Cox.
GARDNER CHUBB Kolyma-2?
PALMER Our man in the Russian Embassy.
GARDNER CHUBB Mm.
PALMER It was brought to them by a woman who----
GARDNER CHUBB The Russians?
PALMER Yeah.
PALMER It was brought in by Linda Litzke, an associate of a guy named Harry Pfarrer.
PALMER Picture's in the folder.
PALMER With Pfarrer's.
GARDNER CHUBB The Russians.
PALMER Yeah.
GARDNER CHUBB Who's Pfarrer?
PALMER Treasury agent who's been, um, screwing Mrs. Cox.
PALMER Must be how they got the files.
PALMER Or maybe Ozzie knows about it, they all seem to be sleeping with each other.
GARDNER CHUBB All right.
GARDNER CHUBB Spare me.
PALMER Yes sir.
PALMER But this Treasury guy----it's gotten...
PALMER complicated.
PALMER He just shot somebody in Ozzie's house.
GARDNER CHUBB Shot----your analyst?
Palmer shakes his head.
PALMER Ozzie wasn't there.
PALMER Our man surveying hears a gunshot, sees the Treasury guy wrestle something into his car, follows him; he dumps a body in the Chesapeake Bay.
GARDNER CHUBB Well----what'd he do that for?
PALMER Don't know sir.
GARDNER CHUBB Oh for Christ sake.
GARDNER CHUBB Anyone fish the body out?
PALMER Mm-hm.
GARDNER CHUBB Russian?
GARDNER CHUBB American?
PALMER Don't know.
PALMER Scrubbed of ID.
GARDNER CHUBB And this...
GARDNER CHUBB Linda...?
PALMER Linda Litzke.
GARDNER CHUBB She's Treasury?
PALMER No, we're----um...
PALMER fuzzy on her.
Gardner Chubb is flipping bemusedly through the contents of the folder.
GARDNER CHUBB Well----so----we don't really know what anyone is after.
PALMER Not really, sir.
GARDNER CHUBB This analyst, ex-analyst, uh...
PALMER Cox.
GARDNER CHUBB Yeah.
GARDNER CHUBB What's his clearance level.
PALMER Three.
GARDNER CHUBB Okay.
GARDNER CHUBB Okay, no biggie...
GARDNER CHUBB He reaches the folder back to Palmer.
GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D) ...
GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D) for now just keep an eye on everyone, see what they do.
PALMER Right, sir.
PALMER And----we'll interface with the FBI on this, uh, dead body?
GARDNER CHUBB No!
GARDNER CHUBB No, we don't want those idiots blundering around in this.
GARDNER CHUBB Burn the body.
GARDNER CHUBB Get rid of it.
GARDNER CHUBB And keep an eye on everyone, see what they do.
GARDNER CHUBB Report back when, um, I don't know.
GARDNER CHUBB When it makes sense.

LINDA We are on a long lens point-of-view, from several cubicles over, of Linda slumped at her desk, head in her arms.
LINDA We faintly hear her sobbing.
LINDA Reverse shows Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies, looking at her, unsettled.
CLOSE ON LINDA We are in her cubicle now, her weeping bumping up at the cut.
CLOSE ON LINDA A tap against the cubicle window brings her head up.
CLOSE ON LINDA Ted Treffon opens the door.
TED Linda.
TED You okay?
LINDA I'm fine, Ted, I'm sorry.
LINDA He sits at the chair alongside her desk.
TED You don't look fine.
LINDA No no, I'm...
LINDA I'm...
TED You won't tell me what it's about.
TED You never let me in, Linda.
LINDA Oh, I know you're trustworthy, I just...
LINDA don't want to endanger other people with----I mean, it's a path I've chosen, it's not, you have to isolate, you know, a firewall.
Ted sighs.
TED Uh-huh.
TED Well, I don't know what to think.
TED You both go AWOL on Friday; today Chad doesn't bother to come in at all----
LINDA I know, Ted.
TED Linda, I can't run a gym this way.
LINDA I know, Ted.
TED I'm going to have to fire him.

TED Linda.
TED I have to tell you.
TED A man was here earlier asking about you.
TED Yellow Revision 8/24/07 86.
Linda looks at Ted for a beat, thinking.
LINDA Foreigner?
TED Linda, are you in some kind of trouble?
TED Is Chad running from something?
LINDA Ted, we know what we're doing.
LINDA Let me ask you this: did he know my name.
TED Whuh----yes, he was asking about you.
TED Employment history, et cetera.
TED Real jerk.
TED I told him to get lost.
She takes his hand.
LINDA Thank you, Ted.
Ted swallows.
He looks down.
TED Well, we...
Linda still has his hand.
He tries to cover his reaction to the physical contact.
TED (CONT'D) ...
TED (CONT'D) we just don't give that out at Hardbodies.
The phone beeps.
A voice comes through the intercom:
VOICE Linda, there's a Mr. Krapotkin on line * two.
LINDA Omygod!
She punches a button on the phone.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) Hello?

VOICE Returning your call.
LINDA Yes, yes!----hang on.
LINDA Ted, I'm sorry.
LINDA This is private.
Looking at her, Ted sighs.
He shakes his head sadly, rises and goes.
Linda pushes the door of the cubicle shut with her foot.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) Hello.
LINDA (CONT'D) Is this a secure line, Mr.

LINDA No!
LINDA I----I'm terribly worried about my associate.

KRAPOTKIN Why is that?
LINDA Do you have him?
KRAPOTKIN Do we have him?

LINDA Blue Revision 8/1/07 88.
KRAPOTKIN Um...
KRAPOTKIN Linda glances up.
KRAPOTKIN Outside her cubicle window Ted waits; at Linda's look he turns palms up: What's going on?
KRAPOTKIN Linda holds up a finger: one second.
LINDA Do you know where he is?
KRAPOTKIN Is he not...
KRAPOTKIN at Hardbodies?
LINDA No, I----look, can I come in and discuss this?
Harry Pfarrer stands at the kitchen counter chopping carrots.
He is intensely focused and chops very, very quickly, producing slices in high volume.
Reverse shows Katie Cox in a chair in the living room, frozen in a look up, a file of papers forgotten in one hand as she gazes over half-glasses at Harry.
His chopping continues unabated.
After a long look and much chopping:
KATIE You seem distracted.
HARRY Do I?
KATIE Very distracted.
KATIE The last two days.
HARRY Nn.
HARRY Work.
HARRY The chopping continues.
HARRY Katie's eyes shift down to the countertop, back up to Harry.
HARRY Another beat.
KATIE ...
KATIE That's enough carrots, don't you think?
HARRY Huh?
KATIE For the salad?
The chopping stops.
Harry slaps the knife down.
He stares at Katie, jaw grinding, for a beat.
HARRY You know: you're really a very negative person.
KATIE ...
KATIE What?
Through grit teeth:
HARRY I've tried.
HARRY To ignore it.
HARRY And stay upbeat.
Katie, unused to backtalk from Harry, is stunned.
She returns in a manner as hard as his:
KATIE Harry: stop the foolishness.
HARRY Stop the foolishness?
KATIE Yes.
KATIE And behave.
KATIE You are not talking to one of your...
Her fingers form quotes:
KATIE (CONT'D) ...
KATIE (CONT'D) "shithole buddies."
Harry glares at her, vibrating with rage.
Her look at him is equally hard.
Harry abruptly turns and stomps up the stairs.
Brief tromping on the second floor.
Katie sits in puzzled suspense.
Footfalls descend the staircase.
Blue Revision 8/1/07 90.
Harry reappears at the foot of the stairs with his wedge- cushion tucked under an arm.
He flings the front door open, goes out, slams it shut.
Harry stomps to his car in the driveway and flings in the cushion.
He gets in, seething.
After a beat he pulls out his cell phone and dials.
A ring.
Pick-up.
A female voice:
SANDY Hello?
HARRY Honey.
HARRY It's so good to hear your voice.
SANDY Something wrong, Harry?
HARRY No.
HARRY Yes.
HARRY Can you come home?
HARRY Your baby needs you.
HARRY A beat.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Can you please come home?
SANDY Harry, you know I----
HARRY I can show you your present.
HARRY It's finished.
SANDY Oh Harry.
SANDY I can't just leave the book tour.
SANDY Harry sags.
HARRY Yeah.
SANDY There are two days left.
SANDY There's still Seattle.
HARRY Yeah.
HARRY Blue Revision 8/1/07 91.
SANDY I love you, Harry.
HARRY Okay.
HARRY Yeah.
HARRY Love you too.
HARRY He folds the phone, miserable.
HARRY As he pockets it his attention is caught by something in the
side-view mirror:
The car parked across the street.
A man's shape in the driver's seat.
Harry, jaw set, gets out of the car and starts down the drive.
The parked car starts.
HARRY Hey!
HARRY Fucker!
HARRY The car tries to pull out but is closely hemmed in by cars front and back; it will need a couple moves.
HARRY Harry runs back to his own car, starts it, throws it into reverse and backs straight down the drive toward the frantically shuttling car.
HARRY He t-bones it.
VOICE FROM WITHIN CAR Fucker!
VOICE FROM WITHIN CAR Harry, amped, throws his car into drive, pulls halfway up the driveway.
HARRY Fucker!
HARRY Fucker!
HARRY He again throws the car into reverse.
HARRY The man in the other car abandons his attempt to pull out and scrambles frantically toward the passenger side.
HARRY Harry again smashes into the car.
HARRY Blue Revision 8/1/07 92.
The other man emerges from the far side.
He flees down the sidewalk as fast as his weight will permit, pocket change jingling, yelling as he runs:
MAN Fucker!
Harry runs after him, calling:
HARRY Who do you work for?!
HARRY Who do you work for?!
HARRY Pounding footsteps.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Tell me!
HARRY (CONT'D) The overweight man does not have Harry's stamina: Harry closes, leaps, and tackles.
He crawls up the man's body, hand-over-hand, panting:
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Who do you work for?
HARRY (CONT'D) CIA?
HARRY (CONT'D) NSC?
The other man is panting much harder:
MAN Tuchman Marsh!
MAN This stops Harry.
MAN He isn't sure what he's heard.
HARRY What?
MAN Tuchman Marsh!
HARRY ...
HARRY Tuchman Marsh?
MAN Yes!
HARRY Your name is...
HARRY Tuchman Marsh?
MAN Tuchman Marsh Hauptman Rodino!
Harry stares at the man underneath him.
The gasping man explains:
MAN (CONT'D) ...
MAN (CONT'D) I work for them!
HARRY You...
HARRY work for Tuchman Marsh.
MAN Yes!
HARRY Which is a law firm.
MAN No!
MAN A rock band!
MAN Yes, it's a law firm!
HARRY Well...
HARRY why are you following me?
MAN Divorce action, numbnuts!
Harry is blindsided.
He stares.
He slowly sits up, digesting:
HARRY My...
HARRY my wife hired you?!
The freed Tuchman Marsh man also sits up, still panting heavily.
MAN No.
MAN Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh.
MAN Tuchman Marsh hired me.
MAN I work for Tuchman Marsh.
HARRY You're----you're----a divorce detective.
MAN Not just.
MAN Credit, missing persons, whatever.
HARRY But this is divorce.
MAN Well...
MAN yeah.
Harry rises and walks stiffly, zombie-like, up the street.
The man watches him go.
After a few paces Harry stops and sits on the curb.
He starts weeping.
The man, still breathing heavily, calls out:
MAN (CONT'D) ...
MAN (CONT'D) Jesus----grow up, man!
MAN (CONT'D) It happens to everybody!
Harry's cell phone chirps.
He fishes it out and unfolds it, sniveling.
HARRY Yeah?
VOICE Harry, it's Osbourne Cox.
Harry stares, trying to fit this in.
Osbourne prompts, after a silent beat:
VOICE (CONT'D) ...
VOICE (CONT'D) Harry?
HARRY Yeah?
OSBOURNE Harry, could I get your wife's number?
OSBOURNE This is Osbourne Cox, could I trouble you for your wife's----
HARRY You can't tell her anything she doesn't already know, fucker.
OSBOURNE What?
Harry again stares: maybe he has this figured wrong.
After a silence:
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...Is this...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Harry Pfarrer?
HARRY You want...
HARRY Sandy's number?
Echoing up the street:
Blue Revision 8/1/07 95.
MAN Can I use your phone?
MAN To call a tow?
Osbourne paces the cramped cabin belowdecks, a phone to his ear.
He is unshaven, wearing a robe.
Filtered rings, then a connection:
SANDY'S VOICE Hello?
OSBOURNE Sandy?
SANDY Yes?
OSBOURNE Hi, it's Osbourne Cox, how are you.
OSBOURNE Hi.
SANDY ...
SANDY Hi.
OSBOURNE Hi.
OSBOURNE Sorry to call out of the blue but I have a, well, a publishing question and I thought you might be the person to ask, I have this manuscript, something to do with my professional experiences, not to go into too much detail but I think it's pretty explosive stuff and I think that it could merit a fairly wide readership handled properly and it isn't quite finished yet but there's a situation where I'm worried about it leaking now and maybe excerpts being published or on the internet, whatever, without my permission, and a lot of the impact being, um, blunted, so I'm actually anxious to bring it to market sooner than I'd planned----I mean, like now, in fact----so I was thinking, I know you, and you seem to do well, so I was wondering if you were happy with your publisher.
OSBOURNE The people you use.
OSBOURNE A long beat.
SANDY You've written a children's book?
OSBOURNE No!
OSBOURNE No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but ----doesn't your company have an adult arm?
OSBOURNE Or isn't it, uh, the children's arm?
OSBOURNE Of a regular publisher?
SANDY Pappas & Swain do children's literature.
OSBOURNE Uh-huh.
OSBOURNE I see.
OSBOURNE So they don't---- okay...
OSBOURNE Are you well?
SANDY Very well thank you.
SANDY And you.
OSBOURNE Yes.
OSBOURNE Good.
OSBOURNE Okay, well, thank you Sandy.
SANDY Yes.
SANDY Good talking to you.
SANDY Disconnect.
SANDY Osbourne yanks the rubber band off a bundle of mail.
OSBOURNE Bitch.
Two pairs of footsteps echo down a long hallway as Linda Litzke is escorted by a solemn Russian staffer.
A waiting room.
A long beat; Linda sits waiting.
A door opens.
Mr. Krapotkin emerges.
Linda stands to go to the inner office but Krapotkin motions her back down.
KRAPOTKIN Yes, madam.
KRAPOTKIN Can we help you?
LINDA What kind of Mickey Mouse embassy are you running?!
LINDA I've been waiting here for fifty-five minutes, and I'm----
KRAPOTKIN I am so sorry, madam.
KRAPOTKIN An urgent matter.
LINDA Well this could be urgent too, since, you know, Chad has been missing for forty-eight hours now and----
KRAPOTKIN I don't know the whereabouts of Chad, madam.
LINDA Well he was gathering information for you when he----
KRAPOTKIN We're not interested in such "information".
KRAPOTKIN It was drivel.
Linda is dumbfounded.
A silent beat.
LINDA ...
LINDA Dribble!
Krapotkin fishes something from his pocket.
KRAPOTKIN Would you like your disk back?
LINDA ...
LINDA Dribble!
Krapotkin stands with the disk extended toward her.
KRAPOTKIN I'm so sorry I can't help you.
Linda recovers from her astonishment and is moved to outrage:
LINDA I'll tell you what's dribble!
LINDA You listen to me, Mr. Krapkin!
LINDA I am----
LINDA Blue Revision 8/1/07 98.
Looking the opposite way.
We hear two pairs of footsteps.
They approach for several beats and then Linda and her escort enter frame and recede, footsteps echoing.
The staffer's hand is on Linda's elbow.
As we hold on their backs and they continue to walk, Linda jerks her arm away; the staffer regrabs it.
She jerks away again.
LINDA Cut it out.
An exercise show plays on the TV, unwatched.
Osbourne sits at a little table looking at a notice torn from a windowed envelope.
OSBOURNE ...
OSBOURNE What?
OSBOURNE He brings the notice close, squints at it.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) What the fuck?
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) He quickly shuffles through the rest of the mail, pulls out another envelope, rips it open.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Blue Revision 8/1/07 99.
A MINUTE LATER Osbourne paces, drink in hand, staring at another piece of mail.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) What the fuck?
A MINUTE LATER Osbourne is back at the table, drink half-consumed, listening at the phone.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Yes...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) No...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Yes, I want to know why the check for my slip fee was returned for insufficient funds...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Slip fee, for docking my boat, the check was returned...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) No, m'dam, it's not zero, I have about forty thousand dollars in that account...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) When?
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) When?...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) But she can't do that----no, yes, technically it may be a joint account but she doesn't use it, it's not her money...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) No!
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) No!
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) What access, it's not possible!
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Without my permission?
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) What about the, my, the, our savings account?
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) My savings account?...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I don't know the fucking number!
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) You think I memorize the fucking numbers on my fucking bank accounts!
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Moron!...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Hello?
We are looking at the exterior of the house in wide shot.
* Peaceful neighborhood.
Birds chirp.
From inside the house, though, we can faintly hear sobs, * punctuated by sounds of exertion.
Each gasp of effort ends * in a dull clang.
The wracking sobs bump up loud at the cut inside.
Harry is weeping as he demolishes the love seat with a * sledgehammer.
Blue Revision 8/1/07 99A.
Ted stares, horrified.
After a beat:
TED No-o-o-o-o-o way.
TED No way.
TED Whoa.
TED No way, Linda...
TED She sits opposite him in his office.
TED Ted shakes his head.
TED (CONT'D) ...
TED (CONT'D) No.
LINDA But Ted, I can't do it, I don't know anything about computers.
Linda, the whole thing is crazy.
It was crazy the first time, and you want to do it again?
Break into the man's house?
And why would----why would----you said the Russians didn't even want this stuff!
My world is bigger than that, Ted.
There's other people.
There's the Chinese.
Linda, these surgeries----
It's not just the surgeries, Ted!
It's not just the money!
We can use it as leverage!
To get Chad back!
What do you mean "get him back"!
Information is power, Ted!
Hel-lo!
What do you mean "get him back"!
You don't know where he is!
Somebody has him.
And we can----
You ask the police to help you find missing people!
And you----
I can't take it!
I can't take it!
I can't take it!
You know I can't do that!
We're operating off the map here, Ted!
This is way higher than the police, it's higher than that!
Linda, I----
I need a can-do person, Ted!
I hate your negativity!
I hate all your reasons why not!
I hate you!
I hate you!

Weeping, she storms out.
Ted stares, shell-shocked.
In close shot, Ted sits onto a bar stool.
Dim bar, tinkling piano.
BARTENDER'S VOICE What'll it be.
BARTENDER'S VOICE Ted stares straight ahead.
BARTENDER'S VOICE A long beat.
BARTENDER'S VOICE He finally focuses on the bartender, off.
BARTENDER'S VOICE He swallows.
BARTENDER'S VOICE Another beat.
TED Seven & Seven.
Night.
Linda is asleep in her bedroom.
The buzz of the in- house intercom.
Linda stirs, wakes and reaches for the bedside phone.
LINDA Hurrow----
LINDA She removes an appliance from her mouth.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) Hello?
FILTERED VOICE It's Harry.
Minutes later.
Harry is gazing off, slack-jawed, haunted.
After a beat:
HARRY You think a marriage is...
HARRY and then you...
HARRY The thought drifts off.
HARRY A sad shake of the head.
Linda enters, handing him a drink.
She sits opposite.
LINDA But this was a long time coming.
Harry looks up, surprised.
HARRY Was it?
He catches himself.
His gaze wanders back to the haunted, empty spot.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Well, yeah...
HARRY (CONT'D) right...
LINDA You're depressed, Harry.
HARRY I am depressed.
HARRY I gotta exercise.
HARRY I haven't run in three days...
HARRY butt- crunches...
HARRY anything...
HARRY Do you think I could stay here for a little while?
Linda starts quietly weeping.
This focuses Harry's attention.
He looks at her as if just now noticing her.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) What?
HARRY (CONT'D) What's wrong, baby?
LINDA It can't always come from me, Harry!
LINDA I'm not that strong!
Harry moves next to her and puts an arm around her.
HARRY What's wrong, baby?
HARRY Harry's here.
LINDA You're not here for me!
LINDA I need a can- do person!
LINDA You're all...
LINDA defeated!
HARRY I'm sorry, baby----
LINDA Chad is the only can-do person I know and he's gone, Harry, he's gone.
HARRY I'll be good.
HARRY I'll be better.
HARRY I just need to exercise.
HARRY Are there pedestrian paths around here?
He squeezes her shoulder, takes a gulp of the drink.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Who the fuck is Chad?
LINDA Could you help me find him?
LINDA He's a friend from work.
LINDA You know law enforcement people, right?
LINDA You could call, unofficially?
HARRY Wait a minute, what's his name?
HARRY What happened?
LINDA Chad Feldheimer.
LINDA He just disappeared.
LINDA He hasn't been at work or at home for two days.
HARRY Okay.
LINDA He----
HARRY You know his social security number?
LINDA Huh?
LINDA NO!
LINDA I----
HARRY It's okay.
HARRY That's okay.
HARRY What's the last place you saw him?
LINDA I don't know!
LINDA He just disappeared!
LINDA The last place I saw him was the Jamba Juice on K Street.
LINDA And he's gone.
Harry squeezes her shoulder again.
HARRY Okay baby.
HARRY We'll find your friend.
HARRY Missing person.
HARRY Piece of cake.

The hatch is thrown open and Osbourne emerges from below.
There is a large built-in toolbox just by the hatch.
He yanks it open and pulls out a hatchet.
OSBOURNE New keys...
Osbourne strides grimly down the dock in his bathrobe, hatchet in hand.

DEL We're gonna go to a station break and then be right back with Bud Fraighling, the Sultan of Salad, and Part Two of our special interview with Dermot Mulroney.
DEL So keep it where it is!
Del and Connie and Sandy all wear smiles that stay fixed a beat too long.
Then Del relaxes and turns to Sandy.
DEL (CONT'D) ...Great segment.
SANDY Thank you.
DEL Yeah, you know we thought it might be fun if you joined us with Bud Fraighling and help make the Fiesta Salad, when we move over.
CONNIE Over on the kitchen set.
SANDY That wasn't discussed.
DEL Oh, sure!
DEL No!
DEL Only if you want to!
DEL Your segment went great, we just thought----
SANDY I'm sorry, I made plans.
DEL Okay, great!
CONNIE Great to see you again, Sandra!
She gives them a cold smile as a technician finishes unclipping her lavaliere and she leaves.
Connie looks at Del and mouths "Bitch."
Osbourne's crumple-backed car roars up.
It cuts a corner of the lawn and squeals to a halt in the drive.
Osbourne emerges, still in robe and pyjamas, with the hatchet.
He goes to the front door and bashes at the knob with the blunt end of the hatchet.
OSBOURNE New...
OSBOURNE fucking...
OSBOURNE keys...
OSBOURNE How's this for access...
OSBOURNE Hardware starts to fall off and jangle onto the stoop.
OSBOURNE Osbourne tries the sharp end of the hatchet a couple times, decides he prefers the blunt end.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) How's this for motherfucking access...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) More things fall off.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) The knob wobbles in the door.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Osbourne pushes the door open.
Sandy Pfarrer is accompanied by a bright young PR woman.
PR WOMAN That was way out of line.
PR WOMAN We were so unbelievably clear with them: just an Oliver segment.
SANDY It's fine.
PR WOMAN Del and Connie are such putzes.
SANDY It's fine.
SANDY Thank you.
SANDY We're finished.
PR WOMAN Huh?
PR WOMAN Well, okay.
PR WOMAN Great, uh----
PR WOMAN Sandy, entered her dressing room, is already shutting the door on her.
Inside a man lounges reading a magazine.
He looks a little like Harry but younger.
SANDY Thought that would never be over.
SANDY The man rises and kisses her.
MAN Mmm.
MAN Me too.
SANDY Let me scrub this crap off my face.
Osbourne opens a cabinet, muttering:
OSBOURNE Just for starters...
OSBOURNE He takes out liquor bottles and starts putting them in a packing case on the kitchen counter.
People sit on benches eating lunches.
Harry Pfarrer is on the bench where he and Linda met, once again spitting sunflower seeds.
Linda walks up.
They greet each other with a kiss.
HARRY Hello there sunshine.
HARRY You look great.
LINDA Well you seem better.
LINDA Harry does indeed seem more like his old self.
HARRY Yeah, I snuck in a little gym time this morning.
HARRY And our exercise last night didn't hurt!
Linda is shocked but secretly pleased:
LINDA Harry!
HARRY Boy, I am through banging my head against the wall.
HARRY I am gonna start doing what's right for me.
LINDA That's how I believe, also.
LINDA You have to do what's right for----
HARRY Yeah!
HARRY Hell yeah!
HARRY I mean I had a shock recently, and I realized you know, life is not infinite.
HARRY No one's immortal.
LINDA No one's immortal.
HARRY You have to get from each day its full, uh, squeeze the juice from every day because there but for the grace of God----
LINDA Exactly.
LINDA The important thing is to maintain a positive outlook.
LINDA Always up.
LINDA Always ebullient.
HARRY That's right, don't sweat the small stuff...
Linda chimes in:
Linda and Harry
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) and it's all small stuff.
Harry reaches for Linda and she slides closer.
He puts an arm around her.
HARRY (CONT'D) This is where we first met.
HARRY (CONT'D) Remember?
LINDA Of course I do.
HARRY You never know what the important days are, until...
HARRY until, um...
The thought drifts away as his gaze fixes on something.
With his look still fixed:
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) I told myself I was gonna stop being paranoid, but...
HARRY (CONT'D) is that guy looking at us?
Linda follows his look.
On a bench a short distance away a middle-aged man with aviator glasses and hair plugs is staring at them.
LINDA No, no.
A slightly overweight woman stops tentatively in front of the man in the aviator glasses and they start to talk.
Linda turns to Harry.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) Have you found out anything about Chad?
HARRY Nothing yet, I've made a couple calls.
HARRY I don't think it'll take long.
LINDA Really?
HARRY Oh yeah, there are so many data bases now it's a joke...
Relaxing now that he sees the man in aviator glasses engaged in conversation, Harry warms to his theme.
HARRY (CONT'D) ...
HARRY (CONT'D) Back when I was in PP there was still some art to finding people.
HARRY (CONT'D) Not any more.
HARRY (CONT'D) And now with the cell phones?
HARRY (CONT'D) Pretty soon they're gonna know where everyone is.
HARRY (CONT'D) Everyone.
HARRY (CONT'D) At any given moment.
HARRY (CONT'D) I mean it's almost the reality now.
HARRY (CONT'D) You would be amazed.
LINDA Uh-huh.
HARRY Did he----when you left the Jamba Juice ----did Chad say anything about where he might be going?
LINDA Oh, I know where he was going.
HARRY Oh yeah?
LINDA A residence in Alexandria.
LINDA On Hillsboro Drive.
Harry has stopped chewing.
He is staring at her.
Linda feels obliged to fill the silence.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) 2055 Hillsboro.
Harry stares.
Linda doesn't know what to make of his fixed stare.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) It's, um.
LINDA (CONT'D) The residence of a guy named Osbourne Cox.
Harry is beginning to look sick.
A long silence.
Then, quietly:
HARRY Who are you?
Now Linda stares, unsure of what to make of the question.
Linda's eyes widen.
She is a little frightened.
People nearby turn to look.
It is a scene.
Harry reaches up.
He grabs her by the shoulders and shakes.
Linda is at sea.
She answers in a small voice:
LINDA I'm ...
LINDA just ...
LINDA Linda Litzke.
LINDA Harry stares at her.
LINDA A long beat.
LINDA He leaps to his feet and looks around in a panic.
LINDA His point-of-view, sweeping the park.
LINDA Nearby, the man with plugs, though talking with his date, is looking at him again.
LINDA Farther away, a man sits in a curbside sedan.
LINDA Watching?
LINDA Hard to say.
LINDA Harry turns and runs.
LINDA Linda gapes.
LINDA (CONT'D) ...
LINDA (CONT'D) Harry!
Osbourne sets the packing box heavily down on a bureau in the upstairs bedroom.
The box is a third loaded up with liquor bottles.
It also holds a mixed drink which Osbourne now takes out.
The ice cubes clink as he sips, poking through things in the bureau.
One drawer holds scarves and accessories and a large case.
He opens the case and starts dumping jewelry from it into the cardboard box.
Suddenly:
OSBOURNE Ow!
OSBOURNE Fuck!
OSBOURNE He yanks his hand back and shakes it.
OSBOURNE He looks at the ball of his thumb.
OSBOURNE He sucks it.
OSBOURNE He carefully picks a brooch out of the jewelry case and flings it across the room.
OSBOURNE He resumes dumping jewelry into his box.
He suddenly stops:
A faint knock.
The front door.
Osbourne waits.
The knock repeats.
113. Another beat.
113. The front door creaks open.
113. Osbourne carefully sets down his drink.
113. He steps quietly to the closet and pulls a small cedar chest off a high shelf.
Linda flings open the door to her car parked on the street bordering the mall.
She gets in and turns the ignition.
Pulling into traffic she checks her rear-view, and her look snags on:
A dark four-door sedan pulling out a few cars back.
It falls in behind her.
Its driver is a man in sunglasses.
He reaches up and touches fingertips to one ear.
Linda frowns.
She looks forward, glances again at the mirror.
Another dark car pulls into the lane next to the first.
Its driver is also a man in sunglasses.
Downstairs, Osbourne rounds the corner from entryway to living room, a handgun at the ready.
His drink is in his other hand.
Ice cubes clink as he moves.
The living room is empty.
Osbourne advances cautiously.
A quick sidelong look at the kitchen.
Empty.
He proceeds to the basement door.
LINDA DRIVING She gives worried glances at her rear-view.
LINDA DRIVING The light ahead turns yellow, red.
LINDA DRIVING Cars ahead stop.
LINDA DRIVING Linda stops.
LINDA DRIVING A rhythmic thudding sound.
LINDA DRIVING It almost makes her car vibrate.
114. She looks around.
114. She rolls down her window, sticks her head out, looks up.
114. A black helicopter hovers overhead, rotors thudding.
114. A black- clad body leans partway out.
114. The person seems to be looking down.
114. Linda draws her head back in.
LINDA Oh for Pete's sake.
Osbourne is slowly descending the stairs, gun and drink in either hand, gun up, ice cubes clinking.
The basement comes slowly into view.
Someone stands behind his desk, at the computer.
Osbourne descends further.
He stops on the bottom step and stares at Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies.
Ted stares at him.
A long silence between the two men.
Then, quietly:
OSBOURNE And you are...
OSBOURNE my wife's lover.
TED No.
OSBOURNE Then what are you doing here.
OSBOURNE Silence.
OSBOURNE Osbourne takes the last step down.
OSBOURNE He advances slowly, gun trained on Ted.
OSBOURNE Osbourne's look, holding on Ted, changes.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) I know you.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) You're the guy at the gym.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Ted licks his lips.
TED I'm not here representing Hardbodies.
OSBOURNE I know what you represent.
OSBOURNE You represent the idiocy of today.
Ted shakes his head.
TED I don't represent that, either.
OSBOURNE Oh yes.
OSBOURNE You're the guy when I went to ask about that moronic woman.
TED She's not----
OSBOURNE You're in league with that moronic woman.
OSBOURNE You're part of a league of morons.
TED No.
OSBOURNE Yes.
OSBOURNE You're one of the morons I've been fighting all my life.
OSBOURNE My whole fucking life.
OSBOURNE But guess what.
OSBOURNE Guess what.
OSBOURNE Today I win.
TED Ah!
Ted is shot in the upper chest.
He grabs a three-hole punch from the desktop and flings it at Osbourne and charges.
OSBOURNE Oh!
BANG----another shot goes off.
Ted barrels into Osbourne, knocking him over----
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Oooph!
----and goes on past him, lumbering up the stairs.
Osbourne gets to his feet.
Pink Revision 8/14/07 116.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ...
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Stop!
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) Intruder!
Ted staggers out of the house, a hand pressed to his chest.
He has reached the front lawn when Osbourne emerges, robe flapping, pursuing with the hatchet.
OSBOURNE Intruder!
OSBOURNE He quickly catches up to Ted and whacks at him.
TED Oh!
TED Osbourne whacks him down.
TED He keeps whacking at him.
Gardner Chubb is behind his desk.
GARDNER CHUBB Wait.
GARDNER CHUBB Palmer DeBakey Smith is seated across from him.
GARDNER CHUBB He freezes.
GARDNER CHUBB A beat.
GARDNER CHUBB Gardner Chubb rubs his forehead.
GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D) ...
GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D) Wait a minute.
GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D) Where's the treasury guy?
GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D) Pfarrer?
PALMER Right now?
GARDNER CHUBB Right now.
PALMER In a detention room at Washington Dulles.
GARDNER CHUBB ...
GARDNER CHUBB Why?
PALMER He was trying to board a flight to Venezuela.
PALMER (CONT'D) We had his name on a hot list, the INS pulled him.
PALMER (CONT'D) Don't know why he was going to Venezuela.
GARDNER CHUBB You don't know.
PALMER No sir.
GARDNER CHUBB We have no extradition with Venezuela.
PALMER Oh.
PALMER Uh-huh.
PALMER Well----what should we do with him?
GARDNER CHUBB For fuck's sake, put him on the next flight to Venezuela!
PALMER Yes sir.
PALMER Okay.
Gardner Chubb is weary.
GARDNER CHUBB Okay.
GARDNER CHUBB So the gym manager is dead.
PALMER Yes sir.
GARDENER CHUBB The body is----
PALMER Gone, sir.
GARDENER CHUBB Okay----
PALMER But----there was a, uh...
PALMER snag...
GARDNER CHUBB What.
PALMER Well.
PALMER This analyst, Cox, was attacking the gym guy.
PALMER It was broad daylight, on the street.
PALMER Our man there didn't know what to do.
PALMER He felt he had to step in.
GARDNER CHUBB Yes?
PALMER He, uh...
PALMER He shot the analyst.
PALMER He shot Cox.
GARDNER CHUBB Good!
GARDNER CHUBB Great!
GARDNER CHUBB Is he dead?
PALMER No sir.
Gardner Chubb grimaces.
PALMER (CONT'D) ...
PALMER (CONT'D) He's in coma.
PALMER (CONT'D) They're not sure whether he'll make it.
PALMER (CONT'D) They think, they're pretty sure he has no brain function.
GARDNER CHUBB Okay.
GARDNER CHUBB Okay.
GARDNER CHUBB If he wakes up we'll worry about it then.
GARDNER CHUBB Jesus, what a clusterfuck.
GARDNER CHUBB That's it then.
GARDNER CHUBB No one else really knows anything.
GARDNER CHUBB Okay.
PALMER Um.
PALMER Well sir, there is...
GARDNER CHUBB What.
PALMER Um...
GARDNER CHUBB What.
PALMER There is the woman.
PALMER The gym woman.
PALMER Linda Litzke.

GARDNER CHUBB Fuck.
GARDNER CHUBB Where is she.
PALMER We picked her up.
PALMER We have her.
GARDNER CHUBB Can we, uh----
PALMER She, she, she says she'll play ball if we pay for some...
PALMER I know this sounds odd----some surgeries she wants.
PALMER Cosmetic surgery.
PALMER She says she'll sit on everything.
GARDNER CHUBB How much.
PALMER There were several procedures.
PALMER All together they run to, um----
GARDNER CHUBB Pay it.
PALMER Yes sir.
PALMER Should I pay it out of, should it be from----
GARDNER CHUBB One of the black accounts, I don't give a shit.
GARDNER CHUBB The January fund.
GARDNER CHUBB Whatever.
PALMER Okay.
GARDNER CHUBB Jesus.
GARDNER CHUBB Jesus fucking Christ.
He shakes his head.
GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D) ...
GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D) What did we learn, Palmer.
PALMER I don't know, sir.
GARDNER CHUBB I don't fucking know either.
GARDNER CHUBB I guess we learned not to do it again.
PALMER Yes sir.
GARDNER CHUBB Although I'm fucked if I know what we did.
PALMER Yes sir.
PALMER Hard to say.
120. We pull back from Gardner Chubb, shaking his head.
GARDNER CHUBB Jesus.
GARDNER CHUBB Jesus fucking Christ.
We pull up, back through the clouds, away.
