Sleepy thick fatigue, the end of a red-eye flight.
Most passengers still asleep, a few read, or stare blankly.
In business class, A HUSBAND and WIFE, mid-30's.
He's awake, reading a document.
She sleeps nestled against his shoulder.
He's trim, sharp, good looking in an academic way.
Even in sleep, she's beautiful.
Wide-mouthed and honey-haired.
The plane's aspect SHIFTS, the pilot's voice comes on in German.
The man lifts his window shade, peers out at the first rays of sun touching the skyline of Berlin.
Halo of lights.
Giant talons, the airplane's LANDING GEAR appears through cloud.
Tires hit slick asphalt.
The couple.
Dr. Martin Harris and Elizabeth Harris.
WIDER: a German IMMIGRATION OFFICER glances up at MARTIN and LIZ.
KA- CHUNK!
KA-CHUNK!
Stamps both passports, swipes the bar codes over a scanner, hands them back.
Martin slips his into a leather briefcase.
Raining.
A melee of travelers and vehicles.
Liz beside him, Martin wheels a baggage cart through the crush.
An ATTENDANT ushers them toward a waiting cab and DRIVER...
a CRASH of THUNDER -- the rain suddenly triples in strength.
A DELUGE.
The taxi driver hustles Martin and Liz towards his car.
He shields his head with a newspaper, piling their bags into the trunk, cursing.
Martin sets down his case, moves to help the driver...
The DRIVER merges onto the autobahn.
Liz yawns with jet-lag, studies Martin who stares out at the passing city.
LIZ Hey...
LIZ You're gonna do great.
LIZ You always do.
Modern 'Deco Revival' hotel/conference center.
A banner welcomes delegates to the World Biotechnology Forum.
The Harris' taxi pulls up in the forecourt thick with red-eye travelers arriving for early morning check-in.
Martin takes out his billfold.
MARTIN I'll do this.
MARTIN You check in.
MARTIN Liz pecks his cheek, gets out.
MARTIN Martin leans forward.
MARTIN (CONT'D) How much do we owe you?
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME Liz presses up to the crowded desk.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME A busy RECEPTIONIST takes Liz's booking slip.
LIZ The Eisenhower suite.
LIZ Dr. and Mrs. Harris.
A BELLHOP holds a large umbrella up to the rain, loads the Harris' bags onto his cart.
Shuts the trunk, the taxi pulls away.
Heading for the entrance...
Welcome to the Hotel Imperial.
Have you stayed with us before?
MARTIN No, this is our first visit to Berlin.
MARTIN We're -- -- he stops short, staring at their bags, stacked on the luggage cart.
MARTIN He turns, tracks the their taxi, already pulling out of the drive...
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME a stab of concern on Liz's face.
LIZ What do you mean the suite may not be available?
RECEPTIONIST I have to check with the manager.
RECEPTIONIST Security inspections of the rooms are still being completed.
LIZ But we confirmed two months ago.
LIZ Receptionist raises an apologetic hand as she attends to a ringing phone.
LIZ Liz sighs, glances back toward the entrance.
LIZ Suddenly curious as she sees...
Martin standing in the open door of the next taxi in line.
He speaks to the bellhop who nods, quickly pushing the cart in through the doors, headed for Liz...
Martin getting in, agitated.
MARTIN Tegel airport.
MARTIN Arrivals.
MARTIN Quick.
MARTIN The driver pulls out into traffic.
MARTIN The rain still heavy.
MARTIN Martin stares out at the wet city.
MARTIN Eyes track as the shadowy columns of the Brandenburg Gate pass by.
MARTIN He lets himself relax a little, enjoying this moment of forced calm.
MARTIN He catches sight of the driver in the rear-view.
MARTIN Young, female, shortish hair.
MARTIN Tomboy cute.
MARTIN Smart eyes, older than her years.
MARTIN Layers of clothing.
MARTIN GINA.
MARTIN She glances into the mirror, catches Martin watching her.
GINA Everyone says how much it's changed.
GINA Berlin.
GINA Eyes connect, brief.
GINA Wipers flip-flap.
MARTIN .I wouldn't know.
MARTIN First time.
GINA Yes, me too.
GINA I mean, I wouldn't know either.
GINA You're American?
GINA He looks back at her, inquisitive...
GINA (CONT'D) For the airport, it's always Americans in the morning...
GINA (CONT'D) Asians at night.
Martin nods, pulls out his phone.
Service dies as Gina downshifts, Doc Martins working the pedals, accelerates away from the large "Flughafen" (Airport) sign, down a cobbled road next to main route.
MARTIN I think you missed...
MARTIN He stops, smiles as he realizes she's navigated around a large construction back-up, saving them time.
GINA You do what you do, I do what I do, right?
MARTIN What do you do, when you're not...?
MARTIN She laughs.
MARTIN He smiles, nods.
MARTIN Okay, dumb thing to say.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Sorry, I didn't mean anything --
GINA It's okay.
GINA I know what you meant.
GINA Her eyes meet his in the mirror.
GINA She swings the taxi onto Wilhelmstrasse.
GINA Stops at a red light.
GINA Ahead, the Marshall Bridge over the River Spree.
Gina moves the taxi mid-stream in the traffic heading onto the bridge.
Martin checks his phone, he's got service.
He starts to dial...
Suddenly -- the cars in front of her start VEERING WILDLY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, just missing the boxed REFRIGERATOR tumbling off the truck in front of them.
The box BURSTS open.
Gina swerves to avoid it, CLIPS the corner...
front tire BLOWS OUT...
taxi skids crazily, HITS the CURB.
Tires SHREDDING...
shower of SPARKS.
Taxi SLAMS over the curb, THROUGH the rail.
Plunges off the bridge.
Strangely serene.
Intense vivid IMAGES...
the playing card 'ACE TAXIS' logo on the dash...
GINA'S EYES in the MIRROR...
Silent free-fall dive.
Timeless.
Dreamlike.
Martin's head SMACKS against the side window.
Gina cushioned by the airbags, which she wrestles back.
WATER SPRAYS IN.
Gina can't open her door.
Steel steering-lock on the floor.
Grabs it, SMASHES the side window.
Hauls herself out...
gasping.
On the bridge above, people frantically flag down traffic...
Gina turns, sees the Taxi, midstream, sinking.
Martin still in back, unconscious.
No time.
Gina gulps air, dives.
She reaches into the front of the cab, grabs the steering lock, HAMMERS it against the passenger window, glances up: THE SURFACE, starts to recede as the taxi slips underneath, sinking...
Gina hammers at the glass again, it BREAKS.
Grabs Martin's limp body, drags him up to the surface.
A CROWD ON the bank.
People wading out to help.
Taking Martin from her, carrying him up onto dry land.
LIGHTS, SIRENS...
The POLICE arriving, pushing back the crowd.
PARAMEDICS quickly laying Martin out on the concrete.
Everyone's focus on the unconscious man.
Gina eases back...
melts away into the growing horde of on-lookers as the paramedics rip open Martin's shirt...
feeding a tube down his throat.
Pushing on his stomach.
DEFIBRILLATOR paddles.
WHINE as defibrillators charge.
A PARAMEDIC lifts Martin's eyelid, shines a flashlight...
in a dark fog.
Distant voices --
UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL.
Youthful MARTIN speaking on the spotlit podium.
Intense, energized.
A college age LIZ in the audience.
LAUGHTER of rapt students.
Loud APPLAUSE.
A jovial older COLLEAGUE eagerly shaking Martin's hand...
Paddles on Martin's chest.
Paramedic calls out:
Achtung!
WHOMPF!
The charge surges into Martin's body.
a CONSERVATORY.
Martin as a CHILD.
Fascinated, delighted as his FATHER shows him the opening bud of a blossom.
Butterflies' wings SHIMMER in sunlight...
Martin's chest heaves up.
Slumps back down...
Liz and Martin making love.
Passionate, intertwined.
Martin's chest rising up...
half-dressed, hair ruffled and wet.
Towelling it.
Turning toward us.
Smiles.
Her lips moving...
Martin's body slumping back.
Sudden QUIET now, the world removed.
Just his face.
His eyes.
They say your whole life flashes before you...
but it's the little things...
the details...
the moments.
Its like looking at a painting.
Stand close, all you can see are the brush strokes.
It's only when you step back that you get the whole picture...
of light seen from behind closed eyelids.
Quiet...
except for a distant sound.
CRACKLING.
Like falling rain.
The sound growing.
Close now.
Filling our ears, as...
.a tiny pin-hole of light, TOO BRIGHT.
GLIMPSES of a NURSE as she tears the wrapping off a fresh drip sac...
BLACK .A man's voice...
BLACK distant.
BLACK German words.
BLACK Small, faded image of a German DOCTOR, speaking with the nurse...
BLACK .again, a pin-hole of consciousness.
BLACK The Nurse, taking a private moment, speaking in German on her cell-phone.
BLACK The Nurse looks over, straight at us, realization in her face, she hurries from the room.
BLACK We REVOLVE...
BLACK finding...
BLACK MARTIN HARRIS.
BLACK Arms by his sides.
BLACK A few days beard.
BLACK A sutured cut on his temple.
BLACK His eyes fluttering, barely open...
BLACK then closing.
BLACK Clipboard beside the bed.
BLACK An admission form.
BLACK In German.
BLACK Where Martin's name should be: "unbekannte maennliche Person", and the SUBTITLE becomes our MAIN TITLE...
Squeak of a door.
Distant FOOTSTEPS.
Quiet again.
Just the distant PULSE of his heartbeat.
His eyes...
flick OPEN.
Vision BLURRED, BLINKING to focus.
Scrubbed floor, white walls, Banks of drips and monitors, his possessions on a table near him...
VOICE Konnen Sie mich horen?
Daylight through a window.
Sitting by the bed is a dark- haired man with a van Dyke beard.
DR.
FARGE.
FARGE Wenn Sie mich horen konnen, blinken Sie zweimal.
FARGE He watches as Martin's eyes tilt.
FARGE Look directly at him.
sound.
A dry croak...
slowly forms itself into speech:
MARTIN I...
MARTIN I don't...
MARTIN speak German...
FARGE Are you English?
MARTIN American...
MARTIN A beat.
MARTIN Farge signals the Nurse to come in.
MARTIN Speaks to him
slowly and clearly in English:
FARGE My name is Doctor Farge.
FARGE You are in the Waldfriede Hospital.
FARGE I'm the head neurologist here.
FARGE You have been in an accident.
Can you tell me your name?
Beat.
Martin nods.
Voice weak.
MARTIN Martin...
MARTIN Harris.
MARTIN Doctor...
MARTIN Martin Harris...
MARTIN Farge exchanges a look with the nurse.
MARTIN To Martin...
FARCE Where are you staying?
FARCE Is there anyone here, in Berlin, that we
Martin suddenly looks around, struggles to sit up.
MARTIN My wife..
Where's my wife?
Liz...?
Is she hurt?
Where is she --?!
FARGE Doctor Harris, it's all right.
FARGE The taxi you were in went into the river.
FARGE You were the only passenger.
FARGE Your heart stopped for six minutes.
FARGE It is Thursday, November 27th.
FARGE For four days you have been in a coma.
MARTIN Thanksgiving...
MARTIN but my wife...
MARTIN she's in Berlin with me.
MARTIN Where is she?
MARTIN Why isn't she here?
FARGE We didn't find any identification with you, Doctor Harris...
FARGE the driver, who saved your life, disappeared soon after the accident and no one else has come forward.
FARGE I must apologize, but we had no idea who you were.
FARGE It sinks in.
FARGE Martin shakes his head wretchedly.
MARTIN Oh, Jesus...
MARTIN Liz doesn't know...
MARTIN She'll...
MARTIN she'll be worried sick.
FARGE Calm down, Doctor Harris, please.
FARGE Where can we reach your wife?
FARGE Does she have a cell phone?
MARTIN Yes...
MARTIN yes, she does...
MARTIN it's...
MARTIN I can't remember...
His voice trails off.
A long beat.
Farge asks gently:
FARGE Can you tell me what you do remember, Martin?
FARGE Do you remember what day it is?
A beat.
Giving it thought...
then:
MARTIN Thanksgiving.
MARTIN You told me that.
MARTIN I remember...
MARTIN almost everything.
MARTIN But I don't know how I got here.
MARTIN Another beat.
MARTIN He shakes his head.
MARTIN Scared...
FARGE It's called retrograde amnesia.
FARGE With severe trauma of this kind, memories get lost, or fractured.
FARGE Most return...
FARGE although it's unlikely you'll ever fully recall the events around your accident.
In the meantime, let us see if anyone has filed a report looking for a Martin Harris, okay?
MARTIN Yes, yes...
MARTIN okay.
The light outside greying into dusk.
On the TV, a German chef showing how Americans prepare Thanksgiving dinner.
The NURSE comes in; starts to makes a note in Martin's chart.
MARTIN My wife...?
MARTIN Meine Frau...
MARTIN Beat.
MARTIN The nurse shakes her head, apologetic.
MARTIN Martin watches a FAMILY, a wife and children, pass his door, visiting another patient.
MARTIN He turns his head, stares at his belongings...
His clothes, Neatly laundered and folded, shoes beneath them.
A Rolex with a stainless steel band, a ballpoint pen, a wad of CASH in a billfold.
Three hundred or so Euros, a small blue BOOK.
Crinkled, water-stained.
Painful effort, he rises, reaches out and picks up the watch.
It's 6.48.
He turns the watch over.
An engraving on the backplate: "E.H.
to M.H. 7.18.03".
Snow falling outside a warmly lit living room.
A fire crackles.
Martin unwraps a present: The Watch.
He turns it over, reads the engraving, smiles up at Liz across from him, beautiful, also smiling...
MARTIN (CONT'D) .She gave it to me, our anniversary.
MARTIN (CONT'D) The Nurse smiles, shakes her head, not understanding.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Martin sets the watch down, picks up the little blue book beside the watch -- 'Horticus' -- the classic botanical reference.
MARTIN (CONT'D) He flicks through it, reads the handwritten inscription: "For Martin, that he may discover the worlds inside..."
MARTIN (CONT'D) A distant smile...
Martin as a child sits with his father in his father's study.
His father shows him the illustrations in the new book.
Martin's eyes are wide.
BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM Martin starts to close the book, tracks some NUMBERS, handwritten on the endpaper.
BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM A beat.
BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM He shuts the book, glances at the TV, silently playing the local English language TV News: "Prince Fahad arrives in Berlin..."
BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM Biotech Forum logo.
BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM A striking 30-something Saudi man shakes hands with German dignitaries.
BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM A shot of the Hotel Imperial...
MARTIN (CONT'D) Hotel Imperial...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I'm here for the Forum...
Doctor!
Please, get the Doctor.
A high-end suite, empty, but with the signs of someone staying there.
The phone rings...
and rings...
Martin fully dressed.
Farge has just hung up the phone, trying to reason with him.
FARGE -- you have to realize the risk --
MARTIN Doctor, I've been gone for four days.
MARTIN My wife is out there, in a city she doesn't know.
MARTIN She must be terrified...
MARTIN I need to find her before --
FARGE -- Let me call the hotel again.
FARGE We can leave a message...
MARTIN Yes, fine, but look, I know her.
MARTIN She's looking for me.
MARTIN You're married, aren't you?
MARTIN What would you do?
MARTIN Farge tracks his own wedding band.
MARTIN A long beat.
MARTIN He sighs.
MARTIN Not happy about this at all.
FARGE This is my card.
FARGE Any nausea, dizziness, difficulty with speech, you contact me immediately.
FARGE Do you understand?
A Taxi pulls up.
Familiar biotechnology forum banner.
Martin gets out, strong Deja Vu.
Trying to orient.
Eyes peeled for a possible glimpse of Liz, Martin heads for elevators.
HOTEL SECURITY is everywhere.
An entrance to a ballroom is flanked by guards, checking IDs and invitations.
DING.
Martin steps out into carpeted silence, makes his way down the hall to the 'Eisenhower Suite.' About to knock when he sees the door is ajar.
A beat.
Martin pushes it open...
MARTIN .Liz?
INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS hallway leads into the spacious sitting room.
INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS No one there.
INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS Draped over a chair, Martin recognizes Liz's jacket.

MARTIN I'm here, I...
MARTIN A HOTEL MAID appears from the bedroom door.
MARTIN Startled as she sees Martin...
MARTIN (CONT'D) My wife...
MARTIN (CONT'D) Meine Frau...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I'm looking for Mrs. Harris...
MARTIN (CONT'D) She suddenly gets him...
MARTIN (CONT'D) nodding, pointing down.
Ah.
Entpfang...
reception...
World MUSIC.
GUESTS flow in through the ornate doors.
Martin moves among them.
Significantly under-dressed in his tattered jacket, the sutured head injury.
Almost at the doors...
when a hotel SECURITY GUARD intercepts him.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have an invitation, sir?
MARTIN No...
MARTIN I mean yes...
MARTIN Distracted, still looking at passing faces...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I don't have it with me.
MARTIN (CONT'D) My name's Harris, Dr. Martin Harris.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I'm on the list.
MARTIN (CONT'D) My wife is Elizabeth Harris.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I'm trying to find her.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I've been in the hospital.
MARTIN (CONT'D) As the guard checks a screen, a crop-haired man in a cheap suit nearby tracks them: HERR STRAUSS, head of hotel security.
MARTIN (CONT'D) He approaches, also checks the screen as the guard speaks to him quietly in German.
STRAUSS Dr. Harris.
STRAUSS Do you have any other identification?
STRAUSS Passport?
STRAUSS Drivers license?
MARTIN I've already told this gentleman, I've been in the hospital.
MARTIN I was in an accident...
MARTIN Martin sees someone through the crowd...
a striking, intense-looking man with dark, wiry hair, a designer laptop bag slung over his shoulder.
Smiling, arms around his two ten year old daughters, twin GIRLS, prettily dressed.
Immediately the center of attention.
People moving forward to meet him.
Flashguns POP...
MARTIN, raises his hand, calling out:
MARTIN (CONT'D) Professor Bressler!
Words lost in the noise.
Martin pushes toward him.
But:
STRAUSS I'm sorry, sir...
MARTIN That's Professor Bressler, right there.
MARTIN He knows me, he can confirm who I am.
STRAUSS If you would be patient, sir.
MARTIN No, I'm done being patient...
Martin stops short.
Staring past them:
MARTIN (CONT'D) That's her, that's my wife.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Over there.
MARTIN (CONT'D) By the buffet table.
Liz.
Looking superb in a black evening dress.
In conversation with a group of men and women.
MARTIN Seeing her.
MARTIN The look on his face.
MARTIN Processing...
MARTIN an overwhelming mixture of confusion and relief.
MARTIN (CONT'D) That's her.
MARTIN (CONT'D) That's Liz, my wife.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Strauss stares at him blankly.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Martin starts to lose it.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Look I have been missing for four days and she has no idea what happened to me!
MARTIN (CONT'D) So you need to take me to her, right now.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Heads are turning.
MARTIN (CONT'D) A beat.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Herr Strauss mutters to the guard, then beckons Martin to accompany him inside.
thread through the crush.
Martin ignoring the glances he's getting.
His eyes fixed on Liz...
her back to him.
A glass of wine in her hand...
her golden hair...
the ivory skin of her shoulders.
Strauss taps her on the arm.
She half turns...
STRAUSS Excuse me Madam.
STRAUSS Your husband is here.
STRAUSS He needs to --
MARTIN Liz...
MARTIN Liz turns fully.
MARTIN That beauty.
MARTIN A flash of surprise as she sees Martin.
MARTIN His clothes.
MARTIN The suture on his head.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Oh, Jesus Liz, I -- Moving in to embrace her...
MARTIN (CONT'D) abruptly she steps away from him, a flustered look of confusion on her face.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Beat.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Liz, I...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I was in an accident.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I was in the hospital, in a coma I'm so sorry, they didn't know who I was ---
LIZ Excuse me...
LIZ do I know you?
CONTINUED (3) Liz stares at him, nonplussed.
CONTINUED (3) Her group also staring.
MARTIN Liz...?
MARTIN Please.
MARTIN It's me.
LIZ And just who might 'you' be?
LIZ Amused whispers.
LIZ Martin, bewildered, growing angry.
MARTIN It's me.
MARTIN Martin.

MARTIN Liz half smiles, glances around.
MARTIN Is this a joke?
MARTIN To the
security guard, flustered:
LIZ This is a...
LIZ misunderstanding.
LIZ I...
LIZ I don't know this man.
LIZ This is my husband...
LIZ Martin.
LIZ She calls to a MAN nearby engaged in conversation.

MARTIN B There it is: 'Dr Martin Harris.'
MARTIN B (CONT'D) Yeah...
MARTIN B (CONT'D) still me.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) More laughter.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) Martin pales.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) A beat.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) Turns to Liz.
MARTIN Is this some kind of a joke?
LIZ What are you talking about...
MARTIN -- because it really isn't funny.
LIZ joke about what?
MARTIN Do you have any idea what I've been through?
LIZ No.
LIZ I have no idea what you've been through.
MARTIN I've been in the hospital for four days!
MARTIN Where were you?
MARTIN Were you even trying to find me --?!
MARTIN Moment's strained silence.
MARTIN Strauss unsure what to do, signaling a guard.
MARTIN Martin B steps in...
MARTIN B Look, You seem like you've had an accident, or perhaps --
MARTIN -- who the hell are you!?
MARTIN B Okay, okay.
MARTIN B Can you please just get him out of here?
MARTIN B Martin rounds on Martin B. Jabs a finger.
MARTIN You.
MARTIN Whatever you think you're doing, you need to stop it.
Liz, please.
This is...
He tries to put his hand on her arm.
Liz shies away.
Martin B between them now.
Martin shoving him back.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Get out of my way --!
MARTIN (CONT'D) Guard GRABS Martin's shoulder.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Martin shakes him off.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Guard grabs him again.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Martin elbows him.

STRAUSS Martin pulling free, steps away.
MARTIN Great!
MARTIN That's the first good idea anyone's had.
MARTIN Call the police.
MARTIN Call the God damn Army!
MARTIN (CONT'D) It's not funny.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I was hurt...
MARTIN (CONT'D) Liz just stares at him, afraid, anchored to Martin B's arm.
Seen through glass.
A WALL OF MONITORS show images from around the hotel.
Inside, Martin sits, surrounded.
INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME Martin rocks in a chair; restless, hands knotted.
INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME A FEMALE DETECTIVE watches him.
INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME An OLDER DETECTIVE is on the phone.
INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME Strauss sits near him, studying him, while a TECHNICIAN fast- forwards 4-PANE video of the hotel reception area, the drive in front of the hotel...

MARTIN Liz, arriving at reception, speaking with the Receptionist, gesturing outside.
MARTIN (CONT'D) That's Liz, and I...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I must have been outside, I...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I can't remember.
MARTIN (CONT'D) The video plays on.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Liz thanks the receptionist, leaves.
STRAUSS As you can see...
STRAUSS you're not there.
STRAUSS Martin STARES at him, helpless.
STRAUSS The Older Detective hangs up the phone...
OLDER DETECTIVE Immigration confirms the arrival of a Doctor and Mrs. Harris on November 23rd at 16.37.
OLDER DETECTIVE An hour later they checked into their suite at the Hotel.
OLDER DETECTIVE Martin breathes in.

MARTIN He's not Martin Harris.
MARTIN I am Martin Harris.
MARTIN The man downstairs is pretending to be me.
OLDER DETECTIVE And this impostor...
OLDER DETECTIVE may I ask?
OLDER DETECTIVE Did he also steal your wife?
Silence.
Martin searching for a response.
The hint of a smile on the female detective's face.
MARTIN He's forcing her...
MARTIN he must have--
STRAUSS -- but why?
STRAUSS Exactly?
STRAUSS .Why?
STRAUSS There's no answer to that.
STRAUSS Martin looks down.
STRAUSS A beat.
MARTIN This...
MARTIN this is insane.
MARTIN He stares at their faces.
MARTIN He calms himself, trying to get a grip.
MARTIN A memory resurfacing...
MARTIN (CONT'D) My lab number...
MARTIN (CONT'D) at Dartmouth...

Then a jovial male voice:

I'm having an out-of-office experience right now, so...
leave a message.
Click.
Awkward SILENCE.
Martin flailing...
MARTIN Professor Bressler, talk to him.
MARTIN He's why I'm in Berlin.
STRAUSS You want us to disturb a Nobel prize winning scientist, simply to attest to your story...
STRAUSS when no crime has been committed?
MARTIN But it has!...
MARTIN That man has taken everything from me, don't you see?
MARTIN You have to arrest him...
STRAUSS For what?
STRAUSS Entering the country legally?
STRAUSS Presenting all the correct documentation?
STRAUSS ON ONE OF THE MONITORS: A view of the Rose Room: Liz and Martin B visible in the corner, dining.
.And sharing a hotel suite with his wife?
Excuse me, your wife?
She is my wife!
OLDER DETECTIVE Even if she is your wife, sharing a room with her is not illegal.
OLDER DETECTIVE Not in Germany.
Look at her.
Soon we'll have twenty more men claiming to be her husband.
The room tries not to laugh, can't help smiling.
The monitor image flips, now just a corridor.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize this was funny to you.
The Older Detective frowns, offended.
The Female Detective speaks into her radio.
Martin tracks, panicking.
OLDER DETECTIVE Listen...
OLDER DETECTIVE you have no proof you are even American.
OLDER DETECTIVE We can arrest you only for that.
MARTIN I told you, I was in an accident.
MARTIN I lost...
MARTIN I lost all my -- Wait, what are you doing...?
MARTIN The Female Detective listens to the radio response, nods to the Older Man who checks in with Strauss.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Oh God...
MARTIN (CONT'D) You're going to arrest me.
MARTIN (CONT'D) You're going to --
OLDER DETECTIVE On Monday, you can speak with a lawyer.
OLDER DETECTIVE Tell him who you are.
OLDER DETECTIVE The Older Detective confers with the Female Detective.
OLDER DETECTIVE ON THE MONITORS: the image from the Rose Room reappears: Liz and Martin B visible: laughing, drinking.

OLDER DETECTIVE The detectives.
OLDER DETECTIVE Strauss.
OLDER DETECTIVE Martin...
OLDER DETECTIVE coming to a decision...
MARTIN I'm sorry...
MARTIN you're probably right.
MARTIN Faces look over, interested.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I...

MARTIN (CONT'D) I haven't been remembering things, very well.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Perhaps this is just...
MARTIN (CONT'D) perhaps I'm confused.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Martin remembers something, fumbles in his jacket and produces Farge's card.
MARTIN (CONT'D) This is my doctor, at the hospital.
MARTIN (CONT'D) He warned me this might happen.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I should go back there.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I'm really embarrassed...
MARTIN (CONT'D) Strauss LEANS in, half convinced.
STRAUSS So...
STRAUSS now you are saying that you are not Dr. Martin Harris?
STRAUSS ON MARTIN.
STRAUSS Eyes tight.
STRAUSS Point of no return.
MARTIN I...
MARTIN I don't know.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Please, I won't be any more trouble.
MARTIN (CONT'D) You can call the doctor.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Please.
Martin in a humiliated daze as TWO HOTEL GUARDS escort him out of a service entrance.
Dirty pavement, a few bellhops smoke in the cold by a propped-open door.
The guards move Martin along, out towards the hotel taxi stand.
INT. TAXI CAB - SAME Martin climbs into the back seat.
INT. TAXI CAB - SAME One of the guards hands Dr. Farge's business card to the driver, speaks to him in German.
INT. TAXI CAB - SAME Door slams, cab starts to move.
Even as they pull away, several high-end Mercedes are sweeping up.
SAUDI SECURITY get out of the first and last cars, check around before opening the doors of the center car.
The man we saw on TV gets out.
PRINCE FARAD, flanked by bodyguards and gorgeous female companions.
The HOTEL MANAGER and CONFERENCE HEAD greet him, smiles and handshakes, they usher his entourage inside.
Martin tracks the Prince, then FOCUSES BEYOND: A view into the hotel bar.
Liz and Martin B entering...
MARTIN His gaze FIXED on them as the cab starts to move again...
MARTIN Wait!
MARTIN Stop!
MARTIN I've changed my mind...
MARTIN Martin thrusts a few bills forward, steps out...
SCRRECH!
A large brown Range Rover locks up tires as Martin steps out in front of it.
A brief moment, Martin staring up into the tinted front glass...
can't make out the driver.
He holds up his hand, apologizing, makes his way to the street.
weaving back through pedestrians, eyes fixed on the bar...
FREEZES as he sees them.
He leans into her, speaks quietly.
She nods, intimate, smiles and shakes her head.
What an evening...
Liz and Martin B get up, leave.
She takes his arm, intimate, heading out to the lobby.
P.O.V.
DARTING, SEARCHING...
PICKS them up again in...
an EXTERIOR ELEVATOR rising up the side of the building.
The two of them inside.
Alone...
Martin walks fast, blind, lost.
Miasma of LIGHTS and SOUNDS.
Frozen MANNEQUINS in windows...
the din of CLUBS and BARS...
sex-shop neon SIZZLING.
Nowhere to go but to keep going.
The river.
Martin gazes at the dark water...
silent free-fall.
WHAM!
The taxi hits the water.
The RATTLE of a U-BAHN TRAIN on a bridge snaps him back.
Its PULSING LIGHTS STROBING like a silent movie.
Faint VOICE in Martin's ear as Rodney Cole recites his message.
Hands numb with cold, Martin pumps in change.
MARTIN Rodney it's me, Martin.
MARTIN Rod, I'm in Berlin for the conference, but it's Liz.
MARTIN She's...
MARTIN I'm in trouble, Rod...
MARTIN Phone issues a DEMAND for more money.
MARTIN Martin fumbles for change, drops a crumpled ball of Euros into the GUTTER.
'Hotel' is a charitable description.
Martin counts out sodden bills, hands them to a WOMAN behind the desk.
She in turn gives Martin a form to fill.
WOMAN Fur Reisepaf3...
WOMAN passport...
WOMAN A beat.
WOMAN Martin looks at her, helpless.
WOMAN The woman sighs.
WOMAN Pushes back his money.
Nicht Reisepal3, nicht Hotelzimmer.
Police...
very bad.
Martin exits, pulling dirty clothing closed against the cold.
He scans the street, unnerved, frowns as he spots A BROWN RANGE ROVER, up the street, parked, idling.
He squints, paranoid, checks the other way...
His eyes lock on a lit S-BAHN station across the Platz.
Martin pushes through the turnstiles, his footsteps echo in the empty tile corridor as his eyes play over the advertisements.
Happy sexy Germans smile back at him...
The SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS behind him, matching his.
He slowly becomes aware, glances back.
MARTIN'S P.O.V.: The empty corridor, curving away...
Martin STOPS, listens...
nothing.
He starts to move again, aware that the delicate "click" of the following steps also begins again.
UP AHEAD, the corridor straightens out at the train platform, several late-night travelers waiting.
Martin begins to hurry...
the FOOTSTEPS also increase in speed.
Another sound: A TRAIN APPROACHING.
Martin gives up cool, starts to run as the train barrels into the station, its noise eclipsing all sound.
Doors open and Martin leaps in, turns to face the open door...
.moments pass, the car's bell signals.
Then a MAN appears, rushing from the corridor, one hand raised.
MAN Please!
MAN Hold the door!
MAN He's mild-faced, glasses, carrying a shopping bag in one hand.
MAN He FROWNS as Martin does nothing to stop the door.
MAN The two men stare through the glass as the train begins to move.
MAN The man shakes his head: foreigners.
Martin shivers with cold and exhaustion, eyes play over the few passengers in the car...
a nondescript man a few benches down who stares at him, then back to his paper.
Martin eyes him, paranoid.
Slowly gives up, lets his gaze plays over the adverts.
Times, dates...
Nov 26th.
Memories reawakened...
Has to write something down.
Fumbles in his jacket for his the copy of 'Horticus,' looking for a blank page to write on.
A piece of CARD falls from between its pages.
Something printed on one side.
Martin flips it over, scribbles on the other: "28th.
Bressler.
12.30..."
Other times, dates, numbers.
Everything he can remember...
Sudden overwhelming fatigue.
The roar of the train.
VOICES.
Lights racing by the windows.
Martin's eyelids droop.
Flickering.
Closing...
LECTURE HALL, younger Liz in the audience.
Students CLAPPING.
Smiling older colleague SHAKING his hand...
becoming...
bees' WINGS swarming in their hive...
YOUNG MARTIN watching mesmerized through a magnifying glass...
their movement morphing into NAKED BODIES.
Urgent, passionate.
Martin and Liz making love.
Liz towelling her hair.
Only now it's dark, and cut short.
Turns, smiles at him.
Face close.
Lips moving.
LIZ Are you ready...?
Martin's eyes creak open.
The train is still moving, but everything has changed.
Morning passengers crowd the car, giving him space.
An AMERICAN COUPLE, their bags tucked tight.
The WIFE staring down at him.
Martin runs water, combs his hair with his fingers.
Tries to press creases out of his stained suit.
He stares into the graffiti-stained metal mirror of the bathroom.
MARTIN Are you going to give up?
okay.
Solve the problem...
Martin sits in front of a stickered and stained monitor, eyes glued to the screen as he types in an URL.
The Dartmouth Mail website appears.
Martin types in his login, password.
"Login failed.
Please try again."
Another attempt.
Same results.
He switches tactics.
Types "Martin Harris" into Google...
605,000 results come back at him.
On an impulse, he clicks "IMAGES."
...
.page after page of men young and old.
Getting married, posing, partying, historical illustrations...
Behind Martin, door jingles, a YOUNG MAN comes into the cafe, seats himself across and to the side of Martin.
Martin focuses, tries 'Martin Harris, Phd'...
Cursor clicks.
A new window opens.
'The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in Drakea pollination.' 'Research Faculty information: Dr.
Martin Harris...' Contact numbers.
No picture.
He stares in disbelief...
suddenly becomes AWARE of the man across: Young, nondescript, his head bobbing gently to whatever his Ipod earbuds are playing, staring into his computer...
The young man looks over, meets Martin's eyes, holds for a long moment, small smile, looks back.
Martin studies him for a moment, forces his gaze back to the page, the negation of his life on a small screen.
Glances over again.
Martin catching him.
MARTIN Can I help you?
MARTIN Hello?
MARTIN The guy points to his headphones, shrugs.
MARTIN Martin STARES at his screen, ears listening for the tell tale sound of music seeping from the earbuds...
MARTIN nothing.
MARTIN Martin rises suddenly, looks to the bored ATTENDANT who nods towards the back.
MARTIN Martin moves past college kids on Facebook, to a dim back corridor, a door marked "Manner," and what's he's looking for: a back door, cracked.
Martin slips into the alley, trots towards the street, glancing back.
No one is following.
He moves onto the street, waits at a light...
eyes lock onto the familiar "Ace Taxi" logo of a taxi passing...
Silent freefall dive.
The 'Ace Taxis' logo...
The face in the mirror.
Looking back at him.
Gina.
Eyes meet...
Revving ENGINES.
Echoing VOICES.
Hunched against the drizzle, Martin pauses outside it.
The playing card 'Ace Taxis' logo.
Martin ducks under the open steel shutters...
The DEPOT MANAGER, a bully with a face like boiled meat, rants at Martin in German.
BIKO, a gentle-looking Somalian, translates.
His English is impeccable.
BIKO He says he doesn't care if she saved your life...
BIKO the bitch cost him 20,000 Euros...
BIKO the insurance won't cover the cab because she had no license...
BIKO the driver who was letting her moonlight in his taxi, skipped town...
BIKO The depot manager's rage reaches a Hitlerian climax...
BIKO (CONT'D) He says illegal immigrants are destroying German society...
MARTIN So.
MARTIN I'm guessing he doesn't know where she is.
No one knows where she is.
Martin studies Biko, nods.
MARTIN Please thank him for his time.
Biko exits the depot, starts to tuck in Ipod earphone when Martin catches up with him, meets his pace.
BIKO Hey, American.
BIKO I'm sorry we couldn't help you --
MARTIN You know where she is.
MARTIN You paused.
MARTIN I could tell.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Please, I just want to thank her.
MARTIN (CONT'D) She saved my life.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Biko eyes him, wary...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I thought, maybe she could use my help.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Maybe I could give her some money...
I just want to thank her.
Please.
Martin puts out his hand, sincere.
Biko sizes him up, then takes his hand, shakes it.
BIKO Solomon...
BIKO Solomon Obiko.
BIKO My friends just call me Biko.
MARTIN Martin.
MARTIN Martin Harris.
Berlin's 'Little Istanbul'.
A Turkish working man's joint.
Steam rises around a busy food counter.
Condensation on the windows.
GINA picks up steaming food from the kitchen, drops it off with two Turkish men, chats with them briefly in fast Turkish.
There's a bruise around her eye, now healing.
She moves to the register where a beefy OWNER counts off a week's pay and stuffs it in an envelope for her.
She thanks him in German, tucks it away and ducks behind the counter to steam milk for a coffee.
Glances up...
freezes.
Stares at her, gauging her reaction.
A long moment, she looks back down to her work.
MARTIN You remember me.
MARTIN You know who I am.
MARTIN She finishes the Turkish coffee, starts another.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I was in your taxi.
GINA I don't drive a taxi.
GINA She takes the two drinks towards a table.
GINA He follows.
GINA Across the room, the owner eyes them.
MARTIN No, you do.
MARTIN I was in your taxi, we crashed.
MARTIN Why did you leave?
MARTIN Why didn't you talk to the police?
MARTIN Hey!
MARTIN She puts up a hand, calming him.
GINA Okay.
GINA Okay.
GINA How did you find me?
MARTIN Your friend, Biko.
MARTIN It's not his fault.
MARTIN I told him I had money for you.
GINA Do you?
MARTIN No.
MARTIN I mean, not now.
MARTIN I -- Gina laughs, shakes her head, tries to push by him.
MARTIN He gets in her way.
MARTIN Eyes from around the room track.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Please.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Listen to me, I've been in the hospital, since the accident.
MARTIN (CONT'D) My memory, it's...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I don't remember what happened but something is going on and there are some people I need you to speak to.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I need you to tell them what happened.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Gina ducks back behind the counter.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Look, things have been happening to me.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I think I'm being followed.
MARTIN (CONT'D) That got her attention.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Her eyes lift, scan outside.
MARTIN (CONT'D) You're my only link to before everything went...
Crazy?
MARTIN Yes, crazy...
MARTIN but it's true.
CONTINUED (2) The Owner is now.really watching.
MARTIN (CONT'D) You have to help me -- She rounds on him.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Patience snapping.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Pushes through doors, gesturing him with her into...
.pots, pans, food bubbles.
Immigrant cooks work, glace up but speak no English.
Gina, really angry.
GINA What do you expect me to do?
GINA I'm an illegal, driving a taxi without a permit, in an accident without insurance.
GINA If the cops catch up with me they'll throw me in jail.
GINA If I'm in jail, I lose everything, understand?
GINA If I'm in jail, they deport me.
MARTIN You're not listening to me --
GINA No!
GINA It's you who is not listening.
GINA You're an American.
GINA Go to your fancy embassy.
GINA Go to the Police.
GINA There a million people here who will help you.
MARTIN But you know who I am.
GINA No, I don't.
GINA What's your name?
MARTIN Martin Harris, Doctor M --
GINA Okay, fantastic, you're Martin Harris.
GINA You're whoever you say you are.
GINA Yes, I picked you up and we crashed.
GINA It doesn't mean I know who you are!
GINA She backs off, a hand raised against him.
GINA He STARES after her, the truth of what she's said hitting him.
Where was I going?
In the taxi?
GINA What...?
GINA To the airport.
GINA Arrivals.
GINA You were in a hurry.
MARTIN But I'd just arrived.
MARTIN It doesn't make any sense...
MARTIN She raises her hands, enough.
MARTIN He looks at her, takes in the bruise on her face.
MARTIN (CONT'D) You got hurt, too.
MARTIN (CONT'D) In the crash.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Thank you.
MARTIN (CONT'D) For saving my life.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Thank you.
GINA You'd have done the same.
MARTIN No.
MARTIN You can't be sure how you'll act.
MARTIN Not until something like that happens.
GINA Well...
GINA I know me.
GINA I jump in without thinking.
GINA It causes me lot of trouble.
GINA She looks up at him.
GINA Meets his eyes square for the first time.
GINA Then...
GINA (CONT'D) So please.
GINA (CONT'D) Just leave me alone.
GINA (CONT'D) He nods.
GINA (CONT'D) She turns, pushes back into the restaurant.
GINA (CONT'D) He watches her explaining to her boss...
GINA (CONT'D) Then turns away, towards a back door.
Fluorescent lights.
Linoleum floor.
Martin sits in a small plastic chair filling out paperwork.
Alone.
The place is closing early for the long weekend.
A man opens a door, looks at Martin.
Martin Harris?
MARC SPIEGLER is German, fluent English.
Patient, but wishing he was on his way home as well.
He looks over Martin's paperwork as Martin places his watch and the "Horticus" book on the table.
Where the form asks for a complaint, Martin has written "Identity Theft."
SPIEGLER Have you contacted your Credit Card companies?
MARTIN No.
MARTIN You don't understand.
MARTIN As I explained to the last guar -- who went home by the way -- it's not about Credit Cards.
MARTIN Someone has taken over my identity.
MARTIN Someone is pretending to be me.
MARTIN Here.
MARTIN In Berlin.
MARTIN Spiegler nods, sensing this won't be an easy one.
SPIEGLER Did you contact the local authorities?
MARTIN Yes.
MARTIN They...
MARTIN They believe the other man.
MARTIN I need a new passport, papers to prove -- Spiegler sighs, a mixture impatience and sympathy.
SPIEGLER Why do they believe the other man?
MARTIN Because...
MARTIN Because my wife.
MARTIN He's staying with my wife.
MARTIN They must be forcing her -- Spiegler suppresses a small laugh, looks away.
MARTIN (CONT'D) You don't think I know how it sounds?
MARTIN (CONT'D) Let me ask you this, if my wife was having some hot and heavy affair with another man, why not just leave me?
MARTIN (CONT'D) Why this?
MARTIN (CONT'D) After all, we're in Europe, right?
Spiegler burns, nods.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Look, I need a passport.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I need the documents that this embassy is supposed to provide.
SPIEGLER Do you know, the things people will do to get a US Passport...?
Anyway, we're closing until Monday.
If you come back then --
MARTIN Monday?!
MARTIN They've kidnappedmy wife.
MARTIN You need to find out who this other man is, you need to be in contact with my wife -- Spiegler exhales, cuttint Martin off.
MARTIN He picks up Martin's Rolex, glances at the initials.
MARTIN Looks at his copy of 'Horticus', the inscription on the inside cover.
MARTIN As he does, a slip of paper comes loose, Martin picks it up.
SPIEGLER You understand, we're not a detective agency, we...
SPIEGLER Spiegler stops, sensing Martin isn't listening anymore.
SPIEGLER Martin's staring at the slip of paper where on one side is scribbled: "28th.
SPIEGLER Bressler.
SPIEGLER 12.30 pm..."
MARTIN I have a meeting with Bressler...
SPIEGLER What?
Never mind.
You've been very unhelpful.
Earlier a woman yelled at me because I had it so easy...
being an American.
Have a nice day...
Spiegler watching him.
Second thoughts.
Consults his address book.
Scribbles down a number...
SPIEGLER Hey.
SPIEGLER Martin Harris.
SPIEGLER Here...
SPIEGLER Martin takes it.
An old friend.
He needs work, and he's good at finding things.
He may be able to help you.
Cavernous lobby, echoing VOICES and FOOTSTEPS.
Ancient brickwork and tile contrast with new-age furniture and technology.
An atomic clock reads 12.35.
Martin heads to the desk.
MARTIN Excuse me.
MARTIN I need to find Professor Bressler's lab.
MARTIN I have an appointment at 12.30...
MARTIN I'm late...
MARTIN The female RECEPTIONIST behind the desk consults her screen.
MARTIN Beat.
MARTIN Frowns.
RECEPTIONIST Your name please?
MARTIN Dr. Martin Harris.
MARTIN The professor knows who I am.
MARTIN We scheduled this meeting weeks ago.
RECEPTIONIST The professor knows you?
MARTIN Well, we haven't met, but we've been corresponding.
MARTIN He invited me here to discuss my thesis.
MARTIN Dr. Martin Harris...
MARTIN She frowns, rises from the desk.
RECEPTIONIST Wait here please.
MARTIN Is there some sort of problem?
MARTIN No answer, she disappears into a back office.
MARTIN Martin shakes his head, exasperated.
MARTIN He scans the building plan on the wall...
MARTIN 'Bressler.
MARTIN L.P - Molekulare Botanik - 305'...
MARTIN Suddenly about-turns, heads for the stairs.
MARTIN The woman out of the office.
MARTIN SEES him.
Nein...
eingang ist verboten:
She quickly grabs the phone on the desk, speed-dialing.
Surreal.
Rows of head-height CORN in a large humid chamber under bright lights.
Above, ancient rusting girders and brick.
Insects HUM.
RESEARCH STUDENTS clip seed spikelets, bagging and logging the samples.
Martin slips quickly in through a door, unseen.
Heat and moisture hitting him.
Above the drone of bugs...
VOICES.
Martin tenses.
He recognizes one of them...
Drakea, named after Anthea Drake, the English botanist who wondered how it manages to reproduce when it doesn't appear to attract any insects...
A wave of anger...
that's Martin's work he's discussing!
BRESSLER It's puzzling, one wonders how -- Bressler stops talking.
BRESSLER Stares past Martin B at MARTIN, heading toward them down a corn row, eyes burning.
MARTIN Professor Bressler...
MARTIN Martin B turns, sees him.
MARTIN His eyes harden.
MARTIN But it's
Bressler who speaks first.
Alarmed, indignant:
BRESSLER This laboratory is a restricted area.
BRESSLER Who are you?
MARTIN It's all right, Professor...
MARTIN B What the hell are you doing here?
BRESSLER You know this man?
MARTIN B -- how did you get in here?
MARTIN B Are you absolutely out of your mind?
MARTIN Professor.
MARTIN He is not Martin Harris.
MARTIN I am Martin Harris.
That's a conversation stopper.
Bressler looks to Martin B...
who shakes his head, embarrassed.
Martin pointing:
MARTIN B oh, Jesus...
MARTIN B A phone RINGS somewhere in the room.
MARTIN B It's picked up.
BRESSLER So what is this?
BRESSLER Some sort of hybridized propagation?
BRESSLER There are two Martin Harrises?
MARTIN B No...
MARTIN B let me explain.
MARTIN B This man showed up at the hotel last night.
MARTIN B Security had to remove him.
MARTIN B The police were called...
MARTIN I called the police, you sonofabitch --!
MARTIN B -- seems he checked himself out of the hospital.
MARTIN B He was in an accident of some sort.
MARTIN B one of the research students CALLS to Bressler in German.
MARTIN B Martin catches the word "polizei".
MARTIN B A surge of panic.
MARTIN B He looks around.
MARTIN B Sees a straw he can grasp at...
MARTIN Drakea Drakensis...
MARTIN Miss Drake was wrong...
MARTIN the PLANT SAMPLE on the table behind Bressler.
MARTIN (CONT'D) A single insect was attracted, but she couldn't see it.
MARTIN (CONT'D) It's too small and it moves too fast.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Thynnidae.
MARTIN (CONT'D) It's a kind of wasp, but it looks like an ant.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Only the males have wings.
MARTIN (CONT'D) The orchid re-produces the pheromones of the female wasp to lure it in.
MARTIN (CONT'D) It's a trick.
MARTIN (CONT'D) It's pretending to be something it isn't...
MARTIN (CONT'D) Bressler looks to Martin.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Surprised...
MARTIN (CONT'D) curious now.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Martin sees his opening.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Hope in his voice...
MARTIN (CONT'D) We talked...
MARTIN (CONT'D) you and I...
MARTIN (CONT'D) on the phone...
MARTIN (CONT'D) we discussed your interest in alternative forms of propagation.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I told you about my father, a school teacher...
MARTIN (CONT'D) his passion for science...
MARTIN (CONT'D) how he passed that on to me...
MARTIN B -- I don't believe it!
MARTIN B You've been listening to my calls?
MARTIN B Just who the hell are you?
MARTIN I said I'd like to do the same for my kids.
MARTIN You talked about your children...
MARTIN Two girls...
MARTIN right?
MARTIN Yeah...
MARTIN their -- His voice falters...
MARTIN tails off into silence.
MARTIN Searching his memory.
MARTIN Expression shifting to one of panic...
MARTIN (CONT'D) You...
MARTIN (CONT'D) you told me their names...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I can't...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I know them...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I...
Martin B picks up for him.
Icy clarity:
MARTIN B ...
MARTIN B Laurel, and Lily.
MARTIN B Martin frozen as Martin B goes on...
MARTIN B (CONT'D) Twins...
MARTIN B (CONT'D) ten years old.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) The same age I was when I told my father I wanted to be a botanist.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) We discussed that on the phone, Professor...
MARTIN B (CONT'D) how I'd never seen him so happy.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) Martin sways on his feet, sweat beading...
MARTIN No!
MARTIN That wasn't you.
MARTIN Don't you remember?
MARTIN We spoke of how brave our wives were to marry ---
MARTIN B -- to marry scientists.
MARTIN B I told you about our honeymoon --
-- our honeymoon in Paris.
My wife and I. Liz wanted to go to the museums.
All I wanted to do was visit the --
but she insisted and .
but she insisted and that's how I first saw that's how I first saw Leonardo's Vitruvian Man!
Leonardo's Vitruvian Man!.
A beat, a breath.
Bressler looking between them.
Wow...
MARTIN B (CONT'D) Look STOP IT!
MARTIN B (CONT'D) Martin B suddenly seems to SNAP.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) This is my wife we're talking about!
MARTIN B (CONT'D) My father, whom I loved.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) You may think it's funny, but it's my life.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) Whatever sick pleasure this gives you -- I'm tired of it.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) I'm done.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) You need to...
MARTIN B (CONT'D) STOP.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) Martin just STARES at the Martin B who's shaking, upset.
MARTIN B (CONT'D) Like looking in a mirror that has taken your emotions.
MARTIN I...
MARTIN this isn't happening...
MARTIN the POLICE suddenly there.
MARTIN Two OFFICERS.
MARTIN Bressler signals for them to stay back.
MARTIN Martin lifts his eyes...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I'm...
MARTIN (CONT'D) He's not...
MARTIN (CONT'D) A beat.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Martin B shakes his head.
MARTIN B I can't believe I need to do this...
MARTIN B He reaches in his jacket.
MARTIN B Produces a passport.
MARTIN B Martin B's face.
MARTIN B Dr. Martin Harris.
MARTIN B Then he opens his wallet.
MARTIN B Credit cards, New Hampshire driver's license...
MARTIN B a PHOTOGRAPH in the wallet's plastic sleeve...
MARTIN B Martin sees the photograph.
MARTIN B His EYES WIDEN...
dog-eared with age.
A younger Martin B with Liz.
In the Tuileries in Paris, his arm around her.
The image CLOSER BLURRING out of FOCUS...
VERTIGO SPIN...
The floor RUSHING UP...
WHAM!
Then NOTHING.
Flickering like a candle in darkness.
Suddenly CLOSER.
BLINDING.
Voices behind the light.
A distorted form slowly TAKES SHAPE.
A familiar bearded FACE...
DR.
FARGE fans a penlight across Martin's eyes.
Propped up on a gurney.
Flinches at the glare.
FARCE The police brought you here.
FARCE The mistake was mine.
FARCE I should never have let you leave.
FARCE Martin blinks, bleary.
FARCE Farge talks briefly to the nurse in German.
FARCE She nods, starts prepping a hypodermic at a table.
Farge looks back to Martin.
Explains gently:
FARGE (CONT'D) Confusion...
FARGE (CONT'D) memory loss...
FARGE (CONT'D) the complete or partial loss of identity...
FARGE (CONT'D) these are common stages in recovery.
FARGE (CONT'D) Some temporary, others longer term.
FARGE (CONT'D) We're going to do an MRI.
FARGE (CONT'D) Try to find out what's happening.
FARGE (CONT'D) Martin stares out the window, not fighting, hardly listening.
FARGE (CONT'D) A bird alights on a branch.
FARGE (CONT'D) The mind is like a jigsaw puzzle.
FARGE (CONT'D) The pieces fit together to create the person we are.
FARGE (CONT'D) With major trauma, the puzzle is shattered.
FARGE (CONT'D) But the brain's ability to recover is remarkable.
FARGE (CONT'D) The mind needs a narrative, an identity...
FARGE (CONT'D) a soul.
FARGE (CONT'D) Without memory, without a past, we are nothing.
FARGE (CONT'D) In the coma state, memories are rebuilt.
FARGE (CONT'D) In some cases the pieces move.
FARGE (CONT'D) In others they go missing.
FARGE (CONT'D) And sometimes...
FARGE (CONT'D) completely new pieces are found.
FARGE (CONT'D) The bird flies off.
FARGE (CONT'D) Martin's eyes track...
FARGE (CONT'D) empty.
FARGE (CONT'D) Comas sometimes perform a kind of alchemy.
FARGE (CONT'D) A patient awakes convinced of a reality that was previously only fantasy.
FARGE (CONT'D) New men, in effect, with new lives...
FARGE (CONT'D) new loves.
MARTIN Doctor...
MARTIN Do you know what it feels like, to become insane?
FARGE ..There is quite a lot of literature on the subject.
FARGE But finally, I would say it's a
MARTIN I can tell you.
MARTIN Martin looks over, Farge almost RECOILS at the intensity in Martin's eyes.
MARTIN Fear.
MARTIN Loss.
MARTIN Anger.
It's like a war, between what you know...
He taps his forehead.
MARTIN (CONT'D) .and what you believe.
MARTIN (CONT'D) His hand moves down his body to his chest, taps his heart.
MARTIN (CONT'D) He LEANS towards Farge.
MARTIN (CONT'D) .who do you think wins?
MARTIN (CONT'D) Martin SMILES.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Tight, hurting, fatalistic.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Farge, almost afraid, nods to the nurse who slips the needle in.
Far-off VOICES.
Gurney MOVING beneath him.
Looking up.
Lights passing.
RHYTHMIC SOUND of the wheels becoming...
.Claustrophobic nightmare; a support holds Martin's head rigid, earphones piping soothing CLASSICAL MUSIC, but the noise of the machine is all-engulfing.
DUNN-DUNN-DUNN.
The sound DEAFENING.
Scanner moving over him...
Martin's eyes empty...
far far away.
Undulating bodies moving over each other, Martin and Liz making love.
Urgency building.
Suddenly SHIFTING...
Martin B and Liz drinking in the hotel bar...
she leaning over, whispering to him, intimate.
an abrupt jolt.
Electric WHINE.
Platform moves, sliding Martin out of the tube.
His eyes open, take in the room.
.tending to him.
One raises a needle, injects a CLOUDY SUBSTANCE into Martin's IV bag...
.The MRI Control Booth, empty.
Martin squints, a little confused.
He raises his eyes, looks into the face of the man from the Internet Cafe!
Call him JONES.
MARTIN his mind struggles to compute.
MARTIN The sudden overwhelming realization that he's not insane.
MARTIN This man is HERE.
MARTIN His eyes DART as the other orderly glances over, the man from the train tunnel.
MARTIN Call him SMITH.
MARTIN He smiles at Martin, polite, nondescript.
MARTIN Ghostly in his disinterest.
JONES Hello, Martin.
JONES This won't take very long.
JONES Martin tries to raise up but can't move -- his arms and legs are like lead.
JONES He opens his mouth to call out, his voice barely a murmur.
JONES His eyes lock on the IV bag, the steady drip...
JONES drip...
JONES down the line into his body...
JONES The two men quickly lift Martin, hefting him face-down onto a gurney.
JONES One arm dangles.
-- The Men's shoes, thick soled, black.
Linoleum Tile.
Wheels of the gurney.
-- Jones, stuffing his clothes and effects into a plastic bag, tossing them under the gurney.
Smith pushing...
NURSE Excuse me, where are you taking this patient?
NURSE Martin's vision RACKS, traces the Nurse's white sneakers, standing in the now open doorway to the room.
NURSE Martin STRAINS to yell, to speak, nothing.
NURSE He can just move his head enough to eyeball the IV.
NURSE Drip...
NURSE drip...
NURSE drip...
JONES We have instruction to move this patient to the American Hospital at Wiesbaden.
JONES Here are the papers.
JONES The rustle of paper.
JONES Martin CONCENTRATES, eyes on the IV tube, hanging between the bars of the gurney and his arm.
JONES Great Effort, He LEANS, pinching the tube closed.
JONES CLOSE ON THE IV: The drips...
JONES stop.
NURSE I'm surprised I wasn't informed...
NURSE Let me check with -- A SOUND, like paper torn quick...
NURSE and THE NURSE FALLS TO THE FLOOR, STARING UP AT MARTIN,
Martin gazes down at her in HORROR as she bleeds out, staring upwards at him, the light in her eyes dying.
Around him Smith and Jones start to MOVE, locking the door, opening cabinets, working fast, Martin's eyes lock on: a pair of scissors, tucked in her apron.
Eyes watering, adrenaline surging, Martin WILLS his hand to reach down, palm the scissors, just as the Nurse's body is dragged away, leaving a trail of red...
The MRI ROOM door opens, the two 'orderlies' wheel the barely conscious Martin out into the corridor.
Behind them, the room is spotless.
They round a corner, almost at the EXIT...
Doors ahead BLOW OPEN.
Doctors, Paramedics rushing forward with various WOUNDED on gurneys.
Something big has happened.
Smith and Jones eye the madness coming their way, command decision, they duck into
where a feeble OLD MAN mumbles at them from his bed.
They ignore the man, go about checking Martin.
Jones lifts his head, pries open one eyelid after the other while Smith ties down his arms, covers him with a sheet.
Suddenly, the door OPENS.
A DOCTOR, breathless.
You two.
We need help!.
Right now!
No choice.
They exit after the doctor, Jones glancing back at Martin as the door swings shut behind them.
A beat.
The covered shape on the gurney starts to MOVE.
Martin's hand saws back and forth, using the scissors to cut the straps that bind him.
ACROSS, the Old Man tracks the motion...
scared.
Success!
A strap gives way.
Martin paws the blanket weakly away.
Feels along his arm, and pulls out the IV.
Blood drips.
He rises up, trying to orient...
the old MAN staring at him...
DAZZLING daylight framed by a window...
strange reverberating ECHOES...
MARTIN pulls himself upright.
MARTIN Tries to stand, but his body is like Jello.
MARTIN Reaches out, grabs the leg of a steel equipment trolley which TEETERS...
MARTIN CRASHES to the floor, showering Martin with a CASCADE of instruments and dressings.
ALARMS RING.
Emergency team clusters around a lifeless PATIENT, working fast.
Smith and Jones, resentfully holding drip bags.
They heard that.
Turn, eyes meeting.
Set down their drip bags.
Edge back toward the door...
Smith and Jones, hurrying down the hall.
Quick check into the patient's room reveals Martin GONE, the old man GESTURING, panicked...
They moves on, fast, around a corner into...
Very busy.
Patients...
doctors and nurses.
Smith and Jones push into the room, scanning...
see:
shuffling towards the doors!
Given away by the plastic bag and the hospital gown showing under the jacket.
BAM!
Entrance doors SLAM OPEN.
PARAMEDICS charge in, wheeling in MORE ACCIDENT PATIENTS on a gurneys past Martin as he exits.
Smith and Jones break into a run, trying to press through TWO MORE CREWS coming through with more CRASH
CHAOS here.
Ambulances arriving, departing.
Crews slamming their rigs closed, taking off, SIRENS WAILING.
Other arriving with wounded...
Smith and Jones rush out of the hospital doors, pull up.
The many ambulances, the crowds...
no sign of Martin.
Cop cars and fire trucks surround an accident scene where a truck has side-swiped a trolley-car.
Ambulance pulls up behind them.
PARAMEDICS jump out, one of them pulling open the back doors...
startles as he finds Martin, now dressed back in his clothes, a reassuring hand held up, climbing out unsteadily:
MARTIN It's okay...
MARTIN I'm fine...
MARTIN Paramedic would do something, but his colleague's YELLING at him to hurry.
MARTIN Just has to watch Martin go...
weaving down the busy sidewalk, buffeting against annoyed shoppers.
Looks behind to see if he's being followed.
Nobody.
Keeps pressing on, finally arriving at
tended by a Middle-Eastern Man who stares at Martin.
Martin eyes warm Gyros and Souvlakis, rummages for money...
comes out with just a slip of paper with writing on it: The slip the man from the embassy wrote on.
He focuses, his mind clearing: A name: Jurgen.
An address.
It's something.
A CORONER's hand slides a zipper closed, past the lifeless eyes of the Nurse.
The two DETECTIVES from the Hotel Imperial sit with Farge who pours himself a drink with remorseful hands.
The entire scene in German, subtitled:
FARGE .The man's condition was unusual, yes.
FARGE But there was nothing to indicate violence.
OLDER DETECTIVE Is he still dangerous?
OLDER DETECTIVE Farge watches the Coroner wheel away the Nurses's body.
FARGE To someone who threatens that fantasy...?
FARGE Yes.
FARGE I believe he is.
Metro train car almost empty, save for a few noticeably down- at-heel passengers.
Martin looks up at the map.
Bleak, uniform blocks of Communist-era housing.
Graffiti- covered walls: hammers and sickles, swastikas...
Martin stops outside one, checks the address on the card.
Urine stench.
Water pooling on concrete.
'Gebrochen' sign blocking off the elevator.
Martin climbs the steps.
Approaching FOOTFALLS, SHOUTS from above.
A group of young SKINHEADS thunders past him, on downward...
Martin presses a bell.
Hears it RINGING.
No answer.
A door behind him OPENS.
A grey-haired LADY peers out.
A beat.
Martin tries the BELL again.
COUGHING from inside, the sound of a LOCK.
The door half opens...
revealing ERNST JURGEN.
Piercing eyes in a face far older than its sixty-some years.
Frayed suit jacket, stained shirt; grey hair yellowed by nicotine.
JURGEN Alles in ordnung, Frau Brunner.
JURGEN He smiles.
JURGEN Frau Brunner retreats back behind her door.
JURGEN Jurgen turns to Martin.
JURGEN Eyes reading him.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Come in.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Come in.
Jurgen leads Martin down a hallway piled with books.
JURGEN Siegler used to work for me.
JURGEN Did he tell you that?
JURGEN His laughter becomes a COUGH that racks his body.
JURGEN Lets it pass, before ushering Martin into a tiny living room.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Sit down...
JURGEN (CONT'D) Points Martin toward a battered chair.
JURGEN (CONT'D) opens a bottle of cheap brandy, pours two glasses.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Turns to find Martin looking at FRAMED PHOTOS on the sideboard...
JURGEN (CONT'D) a YOUNGER JURGEN in East German army uniform...
JURGEN (CONT'D) in a large office...
JURGEN (CONT'D) smiling beside a Russian-made sedan...
JURGEN (CONT'D) The Staatssicherheit.
JURGEN (CONT'D) The Ministry for State Security.
MARTIN That's where Spiegler worked for you?
MARTIN The secret police?
JURGEN A true believer, like the rest of us.
JURGEN Now look at him.
JURGEN I should have had him shot.
JURGEN Another laugh, more COUGHING.
JURGEN Hands Martin a brandy.
JURGEN (CONT'D) He forgot.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Germans are experts at forgetting.
JURGEN (CONT'D) We forgot we were Nazis.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Now we've forgotten forty years of Communism.
JURGEN (CONT'D) All gone.
JURGEN (CONT'D) But it's not just history that's forgotten.
JURGEN (CONT'D) It's people, too.
JURGEN (CONT'D) He sinks into a chair.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Tired smile.
JURGEN (CONT'D) But enough of me...
Jurgen jots notes in a pad.
Hand unsteady, he perches his cigarette on the ashtray, picks up the 'Horticus'.
MARTIN I always have it with me.
MARTIN It was a gift from my father...
MARTIN Jurgen flips it open.
MARTIN Notices the inscription, the NUMBERS written inside the front endpaper.
MARTIN A beat.
JURGEN These mean anything to you?
MARTIN No.
MARTIN It's my wife's handwriting.
JURGEN So, they mean something to her.
JURGEN He looks to Martin.
JURGEN Direct.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Her involvement in this.
JURGEN (CONT'D) There must have been something...
JURGEN (CONT'D) in the past...
JURGEN (CONT'D) some indication?
JURGEN (CONT'D) A beat.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Martin shakes his head, at a loss.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Jurgen leafs on...
JURGEN (CONT'D) the piece of CARD drops from between the pages.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Jurgen picks it up.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Martin's notations from the night before in the train: times...
JURGEN (CONT'D) dates...
JURGEN (CONT'D) places.
MARTIN My schedule...
MARTIN for this week.
MARTIN It's everything I remember.
MARTIN Jurgen turns over the card.
MARTIN German print.
MARTIN A cheery cartoon Uncle Sam: 'Uncle Sam's Bowling & Billiards'.
MARTIN (CONT'D) My friend Rodney Cole told us to go, said it was a blast.
Tapping his pencil on the pad...
intrigued.
JURGEN Passport, credit cards, family photos...
JURGEN things like these take time to prepare.
JURGEN You say this man has detailed knowledge of your research, of your relationship with...
MARTIN Professor Bressler.
MARTIN He knows everything...
JURGEN Including the fact that you were going to have a random accident that would allow him seamlessly to take your place?
JURGEN These people may be good, but they're not God.
JURGEN The question is, why would they want to take your place?
JURGEN What could they gain from being you?
MARTIN They tried to kill me.
JURGEN Yes, did you a favor I'd say.
JURGEN Now you have...
JURGEN Redlichkeit...
JURGEN Now you know you are right.
MARTIN Do you believe me?
MARTIN A beat.
MARTIN Jurgen pours them both another brandy.
JURGEN In the Stasi, we had a basic principle: Ask enough questions and a man who is lying will eventually change his story.
JURGEN But a man who tells the truth cannot change his, however unlikely his story sounds.
JURGEN I believe you are telling the truth, Doctor Harris.
JURGEN A long beat.
JURGEN Jurgen closes the notebook.
JURGEN (CONT'D) I'll start by calling these numbers again...
JURGEN (CONT'D) as you say, it's Thanksgiving...
JURGEN (CONT'D) and there's the time difference, so it may take time to make contact.
JURGEN (CONT'D) And then there is the question...
MARTIN of money...
JURGEN Yes.
JURGEN Of money.
JURGEN Martin takes off his Rolex.
JURGEN Sets it on the table.
MARTIN It's all I have.
MARTIN I'll pay you in cash as soon as I can.
MARTIN Jurgen nods, picks up the watch.
MARTIN Turns it, looks at the engraving on the back.
MARTIN As Martin turns to leave...
JURGEN Doctor Harris...
JURGEN A wince of pain as Jurgen gets up.
JURGEN Lifts a tea tin off the shelf.
JURGEN Opens it.
JURGEN Takes out a hundred Euros...
JURGEN (CONT'D) A loan against your guarantee.
MARTIN Thank you.
JURGEN I'll need twenty-four hours.
JURGEN Call me tomorrow afternoon.
JURGEN Do you have a place to stay?
JURGEN A long beat.
JURGEN Off Martin's FACE...
INT. HASIR CAFE - NIGHT Gina is cleaning up for the night, counting her tips, jotting numbers in a small notebook.
INT. HASIR CAFE - NIGHT The television plays the evening news quietly.
INT. HASIR CAFE - NIGHT In a corner, her boss is tallying the days receipts at a table.

GINA Hey, friend.
GINA We're closing...
GINA The man looks up: It's Martin.
GINA He's exhausted, wet.
GINA His eyes full of need and fear.
I thought I told you to --
MARTIN I'm sorry.
MARTIN Please.
MARTIN I had nowhere else to go...
MARTIN She starts to respond, holds it back.
MARTIN Nods.
GINA I know the feeling.
MARTIN I just need to know.

MARTIN She looks down at him, moved.
MARTIN Eyes track his wedding ring.
GINA You're married.
GINA What about your wife?
MARTIN I...
MARTIN don't know.
Can you imagine what it's like, to wake up one day, and your life...
has been erased.
Beat.
He starts to rise, collect himself.
GINA It was you.
GINA Martin Harris.
GINA You.
Thank you.
He starts to go.
She puts a hand on his arm.
He stares at it.
Human contact.
GINA Don't be an idiot.
GINA Come on...
GINA He hesitates, then lets her lead him out of the cafe.
GINA In the corner, the owner watches them go.
GINA The TV NEWS
changes, flashes a special.
The Owner looks up: ON TELEVISION: Martin's face, caught by a camera at the hospital.
Juxtaposed next to it, a smiling picture of the Nurse.
German text scrolls: "Wanted for Murder..."
The Owner's hand moves, picks up the phone.
The Brown Range Rover idles on the street.
Exhaust plumes.
Inside, two figures statue in silence.
Smith and Jones.
Waiting.
The engine idles, the vents blow heat.
Suddenly, an ELECTRONIC SCRAMBLER on the dashboard SQUAWKS in German.
Martin and Gina walk side by side, unused to the company.
GINA So, how long are you married?
MARTIN .Five years.
GINA Where did you meet her?
MARTIN Yale...
MARTIN I was a teaching assistant.
MARTIN Liz heard me lecture.
GINA And there's no way she just didn't...
GINA recognize you?
GINA He shakes his head.
GINA They reach the cement steps of an overpass, climb.
MARTIN .You don't have to believe me.
MARTIN It's crazy, I know.
MARTIN Gina pauses, stares through chain-link at the cars below.
GINA Everyone has a story...
GINA Where they came from, where they are going, what happened to them.
GINA Why they're not happy, or alone.
GINA Who cares what I believe.
GINA It's bullshit.
GINA All that matters is...
GINA Who you are, what you do, right now.
GINA She reaches in her jacket.
GINA Opens the notebook she was writing in.
GINA Columns of figures.
GINA (CONT'D) This is me.
GINA (CONT'D) 2,259 Euros and counting.
GINA (CONT'D) The number's the only thing that changes.
GINA (CONT'D) I reach 4000, I can buy papers...
Or maybe I'll come home one day and find a stranger who claims to be me.
I'd like that.
Walk away.
Leave it all behind.
You could do that.
Martin shakes his head.
MARTIN I'd still have my memories.
GINA You see?
GINA We're different.
GINA You like your memories.
GINA very American of you.
GINA He nods.
GINA She shrugs, turns away.

GINA but it's home.
GINA Another smile, tired.
GINA A long beat.
GINA Abruptly, Gina gets up and leaves the room.
GINA Sound of drawers opening.
GINA (CONT'D) You can sleep on the floor in there.
GINA (CONT'D) I have an extra mattress.
She reappears...
tosses something to Martin.
A sweater, a pair of man's jeans.
Before he can speak...
GINA (CONT'D) Don't ask.
Night-owl STUDENTS and BACK-PACKERS at rows of terminals, fingers tapping.
The unlikely figure of Jurgen waits in the line at the counter.
Signs in, gets his swipe key.
Moment's thought, Jurgen types Martin Harris Ph.D into the search window.

GINA I should what?
GINA Have been an artist?
GINA Perhaps in Bosnia...
GINA "Can you imagine what it's like, to wake up one day.

GINA That connection again.
GINA He looks away.
GINA Looks back again...
GINA (CONT'D) What is it?
MARTIN Your eyes...

MARTIN Face-to-face...
MARTIN BANG!
MARTIN BANG!
MARTIN Pounding on the door.
MARTIN Gina motions Martin out of sight as she opens the door...
MARTIN .It's Biko, the soft-spoken Somali taxi-driver.
MARTIN He grins.
MARTIN Tries teasingly to peek past her into the apartment.
BIKO You got company?
BIKO She puts her foot against the door, inscrutable.
BIKO Biko drops a set of keys into her hand.
BIKO (CONT'D) Bring it back to my place.
BIKO (CONT'D) Leave the keys on the TV.
BIKO (CONT'D) And don't forget to reset the meter.
GINA You're the best.
GINA She pecks him on the cheek.
GINA Biko pushes in the door, just a little, but enough to catch Martin, in his undershirt, carrying the rest of his clothes, halfway to the shower.
MARTIN I'm...
MARTIN I'm just going...
MARTIN in here.
MARTIN Biko looks at Gina, raises an eyebrow.
GINA Yes, that's right.
GINA I sleep with every married American you send my way -- Thank you for that, by the way.
BIKO Hey, no need to explain to me.
GINA Get on your way!
GINA Go!

GINA Watching them work is awe-inspiring, chilling.
GINA There's no wasted motion whatsoever.
GINA Their faces calm, observant.
GINA Jones holds Gina, gun covers the dark entrance to the bathroom where the shower still runs as Smith turns the music up LOUD, then opens the oven, blows out the pilot light, turns on the gas...
GINA CLOSE ON THE GAS -- A hazy layer, rippling over the floor...
GINA Smith grabs a candle off Gina's table, lights its wick, sets it on top of the stove.
PRESSED against the wall, trapped, fully aware of what's _ going on, Martin.
He's pulled on clothes.
By looking in the small mirror over the sink, he can see the men going about their work.
He can see their weapons.
His eyes SEARCH for anything useful, anything at all.
There's nothing.
He reaches towards the small window to the exterior.
It swings open, revealing the FIRE ESCAPE beyond.
The gas HISSES as it spills into the room.
Smith grabs the bottle of alcohol, douses Gina as with one hand Jones produces a hypodermic...
A LOW THUMP from the bathroom.
Smith REACTS instantly, KICKS in the bathroom door, gun lined...
on NOTHING.
The empty shower runs.
The window to the exterior swings gently.
GINA Terror-stricken, realizing Martin has abandoned her.
GINA Jones nods to Smith who goes out the door, covers the hall.
GINA Jones FLIPS Gina onto her stomach, presses her face to the floor, pulling down the top of her pants as he prepares to inject her with the hypodermic.
GINA She struggles, SCREAMS IN RAGE, chokes on the gas.
GINA Her EYES WIDEN as Jones slides the needle in, starts to PRESS...
GINA CRASH!
GINA Martin blasts in from the fire escape, through the window nearest them, catching Jones in the face, cutting his face.
GINA He tumbles over -- his gun sliding away...
Tumble together, SMASH into the sideboard which collapses, splintering into the kitchen.
Martin tries to hit Jones who easily deflects the blow, leaps cat-like to his feet, moving towards his gun as Smith re- enters, weapon drawn, and FREEZES, his eyes tracking: THE CANDLE, teetering on the stove...
now falling over...
rolling...
Jones, Smith, Martin...

MARTIN She tracks his gaze: Down below, Jones exits the building, looks up amidst other onlookers.
MARTIN Wipes blood from his face.
MARTIN Martin looks around, wild, for anything, his gaze settling on: the far wall.
MARTIN Flames FLARE in, growing.

A mortal fall.
Martin's hands grip a ledge, pull him over.
He reaches back, pulls her across.
They keep moving...
Crowds parting as FIRE TRUCKS scream around the corner.
Smith comes out, the last to exit the building.
He meets eyes with Jones, satisfied.
Martin and Gina emerge from the neighboring building.
See Smith climbing into the Range Rover.

MARTIN Martin reaches into her pockets.
MARTIN Finds Biko's keys.
MARTIN He HAULS broken panes, debris off the car, manages to get it open.
MARTIN He bundles her inside.
Martin fumbles the key into the ignition.
He turns it.
Warning light delay as the diesel's glow-plugs warm up.
MARTIN C'mon.
MARTIN C'mon...
MARTIN IN THE REARVIEW: The Range Rover, making a U-Turn, heading their way...
Jones drives, Smith shotgun.
They cruise slowly, keeping an eye peeled.
Pass the debris-covered taxi, empty.
They keep moving, gaze still tracking.
Smith pops his cell phone.
Crouched down, Martin watches in the mirror as the Range Rover turns a corner.
He restarts the engine, puts the car in gear and pulls them away from the curb.
Gina still in stunned silence.
Wipes tears and grime off her face.
She looks across at Martin.
He glances up at the mirror...
sudden change in his expression.
Gina turns, sees...
Four cars back.
Jones driving.
Smith riding shotgun.
Faces expressionless as they swerve out into traffic, deftly cut back in one vehicle closer to Martin and Gina.
Gina turns back to Martin.
Eyes wide.
This can't be happening.
Adrenaline clearing her mind...
GINA Left --!
GINA Turn left...
GINA Martin spins the wheel.
GINA Taxi swerves across oncoming traffic into a SIDE-STREET.
GINA Gina waving frantically...
GINA (CONT'D) Left again!
GINA (CONT'D) Left again!
GINA (CONT'D) Now right.
GINA (CONT'D) Here.
GINA (CONT'D) HERE!
GINA (CONT'D) Just in time, Martin pulls a right.
GINA (CONT'D) Cab drifts, SLAMS a wall side-on...
GINA (CONT'D) bounces back into the center of the road.
GINA (CONT'D) Jesus!
GINA (CONT'D) A look from Martin: What?
GINA (CONT'D) Gina glances behind.
GINA (CONT'D) No sign of them.
GINA (CONT'D) Moment's relief.
GINA (CONT'D) Turns to her right.
GINA (CONT'D) Sees the RANGE ROVER racing down the parallel side-street...
GINA (CONT'D) They're going to cut us off!
GINA (CONT'D) Right.
GINA (CONT'D) Turn right -- !
GINA (CONT'D) Martin SCREECHES into a turn.
GINA (CONT'D) Heads for the parallel alley.
GINA (CONT'D) Range Rover FLASHES through the intersection just ahead.
GINA (CONT'D) Taxi cuts across feet behind them...
Jones spots the taxi in the mirror.
BRAKES, high speed 180...
races back up the alley.
Martin floors the gas.
SCREAMS out into oncoming traffic, across a red light.
Zig-zags past cars.
Edge of control.
Zooms through open gates into...
Tree-lined avenue.
Closed GATES at the far end...
Range Rover moving fast down the street alongside the cemetery.
Suddenly cutting left across traffic.
Bounces over the curb, full-speed into the grounds.
4WD slaloming past gravestones, rapidly closing on the taxi...
Closed gates ahead.
No choice.
Martin puts his foot down.
SMASHES through the gates.
Flying hinge SLAMS the windshield -- glass instantly spidering opaque...
Martin driving blind.
Careens against the embankment, WHIPLASHES up, spin on its axis.
Rolling...
over the edge of the embankment, TUMBLING over and over.
SLAMS DOWN right way up, axles crumpling.
QUIET.
Steaming HISS of the engine.
Martin's hands still locked on the wheel.
Gina next to him.
Martin shoves open the door.
Clambers out.
A maze of tracks and power lines below street level.
S-Bahn, U-Bahn, high-speed ICE trains, freight...
tracks disappearing in each direction into tunnels.
A sound.
Martin turns, looks up...
THE RANGE ROVER, Jones at the wheel...
SPOTS THEM.
Engine GUNS, Range Rover plunges headlong down the embankment...
Whistling ROAR...
as a HIGH SPEED TRAIN hurtles out of the one of the tunnels.
Martin grabs Gina's hand.
MARTIN C'mon...!
MARTIN Running side-by-side.
MARTIN Train horn BLASTS as they cross right in front of it as the Range Rover, cut off, SPINS 90 degrees, races down the tracks alongside it.
MARTIN Martin and Gina scramble across tracks, towards a tunnel...
MARTIN the Range Rover passes the back of the train.
MARTIN HARD right, over the tracks.
MARTIN Too Fast.
MARTIN The car catches air...
MARTIN BELLIES down hard onto the next set of tracks.
MARTIN Front tire EXPLODES...
MARTIN Range Rover SPINS...
MARTIN rear wheels SLAM into the track.
MARTIN Another tire BURSTS.
MARTIN Scraping STOP, car straddling the rails.
MARTIN Jones shifts into reverse.
MARTIN Rims SPIN against metal.
Martin and Gina sprinting towards the tunnel.
Smith jumps out of the Range Rover, lines his weapon.
BLAM!
BLAM!
Martin and Gina hit the ground, bullets chipping ceramic off the walls.
Up ahead, illuminated, some utility stairs.
Gina GASPS air, spent.
Martin looks behind them...
Martin GRABS Gina, pulls her after him.
Jams shift into 'drive.' Pedal to metal.
Four wheel drive rims SCREAM on the rails, inches forward.
Almost off the tracks.
A vibration.
Jones looks around...
Shunted by a rear engine; no way the driver can see him.
Scrambles for the door.
Too late - !
FREIGHT TRAIN PLOWS INTO THE RANGE ROVER!
Coupling smashes through the window.
Impales the car, CRUSHING Jones, pushing the mangled wreck along the tracks...
Range Rover scraping along the wall in a tail of SPARKS.
Smith dives out of the way.
Car wreck and freight cars THUNDERING past him...
.toward Martin and Gina, pelting full-speed...
almost on them...
last second, they DIVE into the alcove...
through the steel door into the utility access STAIRS.
Gina doubled, gasping for breath...
but they've got to keep going.
Both staggering up the zig-zag iron steps...
Jumps up.
Sprints after them.
Through the steel door...
Smith sprinting up to a landing.
Another landing.
Narrow tunnel.
Booming ECHOES.
Rush of AIR.
Smith dashes around a corner.
Slows...
breathless.
Station JAMMED with SOCCER FANS.
The bars have let out.
Faces painted.
Singing, drinking, a swarming party.
A train just emptying, the mass crowding out.
Martin and Gina, squeezed together between laughing faces, drunken youth, singing, chanting...
Both of them in this chaotic oasis.
Almost peaceful.
Gina struggling to catch her breath.
Relief.
Shock.
Grief.
Anger.
Martin, looking at her.
He knows what she's feeling.
She meets his eyes a moment, glances back...
.sees Smith, caught in the crowd, but pushing his way towards them.
GINA Come on...
GINA They push their way forward through the crush.
The crowd dissipates into the night.
Gina takes Martin's hands, pulls him along a street of neon club signs, lines of youth waiting to get in.
BEHIND THEM.
Smith emerges from the station, tracks them.
Gina hurries them past bars and clubs.
They come to a door crowded with youths, Middle-Eastern and Balkan.
Gina pulls Martin to the front.
Unfriendly eyes STARE down Martin, the huge BOUNCER nods recognition to Gina.
Smith stops, takes in the many clubs, the various Bouncers guarding their doors.
Looks down at his boring suit, nods defeat.
Turns and walks away.
The club is barely-lit, punctuated by beams of moving light, constant music.
The bar a glowing oasis.
Gina leads Martin through.
They pass down through old WWII bomb shelter construction, through curtains, into...
Even darker, only small glowing lights, candles, neon tubing casts shadows.
Quiet almost, only the dull 'thud" of the bass reaches them.
He puts a hand on her shoulder...
she pushes it off.
MARTIN Gina...
and she LOSES IT.
Flies at him, slapping clumsily.
Like an enraged child.
Martin grabbing her...
holding her tight.
Bodies pressed together...
as her anger and fear and grief dissolve into sobbing...
GINA His family is in Africa.
GINA The money will just stop coming...
GINA they'll never know why...
GINA Martin calming her, stroking her head.
GINA Her hand finding his, gripping it tight, wanting the contact.
GINA Martin looking down at the face buried in his chest.
GINA Feeling versus memory.
GINA Gina...
GINA Liz...
GINA Torn.
GINA A long beat.
GINA Her control returning.
GINA And her strength.
GINA She separates from him.
GINA (CONT'D) You saved my life.
GINA (CONT'D) No response.
GINA (CONT'D) Eyes locked.
GINA (CONT'D) .You never know, what you will do, until the time comes, right?
GINA (CONT'D) Martin looks down, unsure.
GINA (CONT'D) She stays on his face.
GINA (CONT'D) Looking
for...
Her eyes shift:
A young Serbian MANAGER speaks with a female BARTENDER.
Both cool, young, tough.
Gina makes eye contact, heads nod in recognition.
GINA (CONT'D) Wait here...
GINA (CONT'D) Martin watches her go, speak with them through low light and smoke.
GINA (CONT'D) His gaze wander...
GINA (CONT'D) into the strobing lights...
.all WHITE.
It's snow, drifting down...
settling on a small idyllic home.
Picket fence.
Lights glow inside...
Suddenly INSIDE.
Liz sits on the edge of a bed, glass of red wine in her hands.
Martin enters the frame, his clothing and hands covered in drywall dust.
LIZ Are you ready...
LIZ Liz rubs dust off his face, leans in to kiss him...
Martin's eyes flick open and the SOUND and LIGHT of the club come flooding back in...
Low, moving lights pass across her body, wifebeater undershirt and jeans.
She unzips the jeans, pulls them down long legs, pulls off the wifebeater, no bra...
hesitates.
Looks back, sees that Martin is watching her.
Beat.
Beat.
Lights catch glimpses of her body, her breasts, the arch of her back.
She turns slightly away from him, pushes a pile of borrowed clothing towards him.
A heavy coat, some jeans.
GINA .Put these on.
GINA She pulls a mod shirt on, glances back as he now undresses.
GINA (CONT'D) Were you happy?
GINA (CONT'D) He looks up, shirt in his hands.
GINA (CONT'D) She doesn't waiver.
GINA (CONT'D) Your marriage?
GINA (CONT'D) Was it happy?
MARTIN .Yes.
MARTIN I think so...
MARTIN I don't remember...
MARTIN how it felt exactly.
MARTIN She approaches him, leans in so she can see his eyes...
GINA So why would she do this to you?
MARTIN .For the same reason I would.
MARTIN If I thought it was the only way to protect her.
MARTIN Gina nods, distant.
MARTIN Martin presses on, difficult.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I keep having a dream.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Liz is in the bedroom of our home, although it's different somehow.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Her hair's different...
MARTIN (CONT'D) she's smiling, about to say something.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Then it ends.
MARTIN (CONT'D) I can remember places, details...
MARTIN (CONT'D) I just can't remember...
MARTIN (CONT'D) how I felt.
MARTIN (CONT'D) He stops.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Just the low pulsing BEAT from the other room The lights revolving over them.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Gina watching him.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Looking back at her.
MARTIN (CONT'D) That connection again.
MARTIN (CONT'D) He looks away.
MARTIN (CONT'D) She shakes it off, produces a borrowed joint, offers it to him.
MARTIN (CONT'D) He shakes his head no.
MARTIN (CONT'D) She shrugs, sparks it.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Inhales deeply, eyes close.
MARTIN (CONT'D) She leans back.
MARTIN (CONT'D) You'll need to get out of town.
MARTIN (CONT'D) There's a man who's helping me.
MARTIN (CONT'D) He can --
GINA In Bosnia...
GINA It was not like you probably imagine.
GINA It was nice.
GINA .there were cherry blossoms.
One day, I was sixteen.
My sister and my brother came to me and said hey let's play hide and seek, down by the creek.
He had ten Marka for whoever won.
It was amazing, the way he just said it...
Beat.
She raises the joint, hits it again.
Her eyes open, but she's deep in the memory and it's intense.
GINA (CONT'D) .So I went down to this place I knew, under the small bridge over the creek.
GINA (CONT'D) And I hid and waited.
GINA (CONT'D) Not really that long...
GINA (CONT'D) Then I went back home, to find my brother and collect my money.
He, and my father and my uncle were dead.
And so was my mother.
My sister was alive...
for a little while.
She turns her head, eyes blaze straight at Martin.
GINA (CONT'D) It was not enough, to kill us.
GINA (CONT'D) They wanted us to remember, every day, for the rest of our lives.
MARTIN We're you...
GINA What?
GINA Raped?
No.
No one touched me.
But now...
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not running anymore.
She nestles in under his arm.
Closes her eyes.
He lets his hand gently stroke her hair.
MARTIN I won't let anything happen to you.
Liar...
Say it again.
MARTIN I'll protect you.
MARTIN She opens her eyes again, looks up at him, smiles, on her way to sleep.
GINA .Cool.
Gina sleeps, at peace.
Martin leans over the one object he has left, his copy of "Horticus."
He studies the number markings on the flap, working...
Vast windowless cylindrical building on the city's edge.
Cheering CROWD; a sound like THUNDER.
A massive indoor STADIUM, CYCLISTS racing on a reverberating wood track below a suspended lighting rig the size of a spaceship.
MARTIN at the counter of a busy bar.
Jeans, T-shirt, Bomber Jacket.
Different look, to say the least.
Across the bar, GINA nurses a coffee.
They exchange looks, briefly.
A familiar grey-skinned figure settles next to him: JURGEN.
MARTIN Thank you for coming.
MARTIN Martin glances around, edgy.
MARTIN Jurgen watches him, glances at Gina long enough to let Martin know he's spotted her.
JURGEN You know, the most dangerous man in the world is the man who feels that he is drowning.
JURGEN He will drag under anyone who tries to help him.
JURGEN Jurgen sets his newspaper on the bar.
JURGEN A picture and article about the murdered nurse.
JURGEN Martin's picture, fuzzy.
MARTIN I...
MARTIN I didn't do it.
MARTIN Jurgen studies him, hard.
MARTIN Looks back at Gina.
JURGEN You said you had something.
JURGEN Martin feels in his pockets, takes out the copy of 'Horticus', turns to the numbers on the end papers.
MARTIN These numbers, are a code.
MARTIN The first number refers to the page of a given book.
MARTIN The second to a specific line on that page.
MARTIN The third number to words on that line.
MARTIN If I didn't have the exact edition of the book, the code would be unbreakable.
JURGEN And what do the numbers refer to?
MARTIN That's where it breaks down -- the words are the Latin names of two plant species...
MARTIN Calochortus Albus...
MARTIN and Umbellularia Californica.
MARTIN Fairy Lantern...
MARTIN and California Bay.
MARTIN Both common flowering plants...
JURGEN Not part of your work?
JURGEN Or Professor Bressler's?
JURGEN Martin shakes his head.
JURGEN Jurgen grunts.
JURGEN Pencils notes...
JURGEN (CONT'D) Your thesis.
JURGEN (CONT'D) The one you sent Bressler.
JURGEN (CONT'D) What was the title?
MARTIN "The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in Drakea pollination."
JURGEN And it was after reading it that he invited you here.
JURGEN Correct?
MARTIN Correct.
MARTIN Yes.
MARTIN Look --
JURGEN Did you ever know someone called Laurence Darnell?
JURGEN Martin looks at him quizzically.
JURGEN Shakes his head.
JURGEN (CONT'D) He was a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin.
JURGEN (CONT'D) He died in an auto accident earlier this year.
JURGEN (CONT'D) He was doing research very similar to yours.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Jurgen studying him closely.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Martin shakes his head.
JURGEN (CONT'D) What is Professor Bressler's relationship with Prince Fahad?
Fahad's sponsoring the Forum, Bressler's the keynote speaker.
JURGEN So they're not close?
MARTIN In a way...
MARTIN they're opposites.
MARTIN Bressler wants to end world hunger.
MARTIN Open research...
MARTIN universal access to all his data on crop cultivation...
JURGEN But Fahad's just a businessman.
MARTIN They're both progressives.
MARTIN Fahad knows we'll need food long after oil.
MARTIN New agricultural patents are worth billions...
JURGEN But his progressiveness has cost him...
JURGEN his own people hate him...
JURGEN the attempts on his life...
MARTIN He's got balls, that's for sure.
MARTIN Another beat.
MARTIN Jurgen slides the 'Uncle Sam' bookmark card from the pages of the 'Horticus'...
MARTIN turns it over, Martin's remembered schedule scribbled on the back.
JURGEN There's a cocktail party, before Bressler's speech tonight?
MARTIN It's in our suite.
MARTIN Champagne and hors d'oeuvres for Bressler and a few of his guests.
JURGEN Is Fahad going to be there?
MARTIN Yes.
MARTIN Bressler invited him...
MARTIN Martin trails off.
MARTIN Starting to get there...
JURGEN Martin Harris...
JURGEN with just a few guests, in a confined space with Prince Fahad.
JURGEN For some, that might be a very good reason to want to be you.
MARTIN Oh, Jesus...
MARTIN You can't -- Jurgen flips his notebook shut.
MARTIN Gets up.
JURGEN -- I need a few more hours.
JURGEN You need to go somewhere you will not be seen.
JURGEN Then meet me outside the Cafe Adler on the Kochstrasse.
JURGEN 6.30 sharp.
Martin and Gina thread their way through streets teeming with AFRICAN and MIDDLE EASTERN immigrants, music blasting from storefronts.
An ELECTRONICS STORE.
In the window a muted TV flickers with the NEWS: A report on the hospital murder.
Martin's image.
Gina glances around...
a COP up the street.
GINA We have to go.
GINA We have to do what Jurgen said, stay out of -- She starts to pull him away, but he's not moving.
GINA He's staring at the pre-paid cell phones on display.
MARTIN Jurgen may have nothing.
MARTIN I need your help.
Liz sits in front of the bedroom vanity in her bra and skirt, putting on makeup.
The room's shower is on.
CLOSE as she applies mascara.
The Camera searches her face, her small gestures, looking for clues...
Shower stops.
IN DEEP FOCUS behind her, Martin B comes out of the bathroom, nude.
He picks a robe up off the bed, pulls it on as he approaches her, places his hands on her shoulders.
They stare at each other in the vanity mirror...
RING!
RING!
Martin B picks up the phone.
MARTIN B Dr. Harris speaking.
Yes, hello, Dr. Harris.
This is Else Adlam from Dr. Bressler's office.
Dr. Bressler was wondering if you might be able to meet with him today...
Gina, dressed in the modish cap and shades, on a new pre-paid
.No, I don't know, but he stressed it was important.
Eleven o'clock, if that's all right?
Weinhaus Huth on Tiergarten...
yes.
She closes the phone.
Across from her, Martin, a cap pulled low over his features.
He opens another phone, dials...
MARTIN Yes, hello, this is Dr. Harris.
MARTIN I have a message for Dr.
MARTIN Bressler...
Jurgen hands over a library card.
A LIBRARIAN finds his request slip, slides two documents across the counter.
One a printed monograph; the other a photocopy in brads.
He finishes reading the printed monograph.
Closes it.
Looking down at the cover...
"The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in Drakea pollination" by Martin Harris, PhD.
He slides the bound photocopy next to it.
"The process of Drakea pollination" by Laurence Darnell, University of Wisconsin.
A long beat.
The two titles side-by-side.
Sudden thought...
Jurgen takes something out of his pocket; the card that was inside Martin's 'Horticus'.
The scribbled schedule notations on one side...
turns it over: the bowling alley's Uncle Sam logo.
Jurgen holds closer, studying it.
His mind clicking...
printed German text.
A number: 21.
And right at the bottom, a small time-clock stamp...
Martin and Gina stand amidst a flow of tourists and locals, near the entrance to Berlin's equivalent of Central Park and its zoo.
Across, the Weinhaus Restaurant is a fin-de-siecle style brasserie bordering the avenue.
GINA Why here?
MARTIN .The zoo.
MARTIN She loves Polar Bears.
MARTIN I never knew exactly why.
MARTIN Gina nods, looks over to the restaurant.
MARTIN Looks back at Martin who hasn't moved.
MARTIN She checks her watch.
GINA Okay, go.
GINA You're going to be late for your date.
Martin nods, heads into the park.
Long, curving paths bordered by green.
A labyrinth.
Gina watches, sunglasses on, as a taxi pulls up and a wiry haired man steps out, pays the driver.
Lap-top bag over his shoulder.
BRESSLER.
Another taxi arrives, Liz and Martin B get out.
MARTIN This shouldn't take long.
MARTIN I just need to see what Bressler wants.
MARTIN Liz's gaze settles on the painted sign for the zoo.
LIZ Take your time, I want to see the zoo anyway.
LIZ ON LIZ.
LIZ Memory, or nostalgia, touch her cool face.
LIZ (CONT'D) I love the Polar Bears...
LIZ (CONT'D) Martin B nods, watches her go.
LIZ (CONT'D) He checks his watch and heads inside.
GINA, doing her best to casually window-shop at a designer storefront.
Stolen glance across the street...
The WAITER offers to take Bressler's lap-top bag.
Bressler politely declines him...
The waiter nods, leaves.
Bressler opens the computer bag, checks on the lap-top inside.
Zips it back up.
Positions the bag by his elbow.
Smiles to Martin B.
BRESSLER I thought we might have a table for three, in case you still had your alter ego with you.
MARTIN B No, thank God.
MARTIN B I assume he's safely back in the hospital.
BRESSLER Well, it's a lesson.
BRESSLER You never know what people will do.
BRESSLER All my work used to be on-line, my e- mails on an open server.
BRESSLER A year ago, someone broke into my office and stole my computer.
BRESSLER I believe they were after my research.
BRESSLER Luckily, I split my data up and double encrypt it until I put it all together and make it public.
BRESSLER That's why this stays with me until tonight's over...
BRESSLER Martin B nods, starts to look at his menu...
BRESSLER (CONT'D) Now what was so important that it could not wait until this evening?
BRESSLER (CONT'D) ON MARTIN B, REALIZING he's been played.
BRESSLER (CONT'D) A single BLINK.
BRESSLER (CONT'D) A beat.
BRESSLER (CONT'D) When he looks up, he's cool.
MARTIN B I hope you can forgive me.
MARTIN B It was something you said...
.It's been tormenting me.
UNDER THE TABLE.
Martin B has his phone out and is TEXTING, blind...
SMITH sits on a bench near a pond, tossing bread crumbs to ducks.
His phone chirps, he checks it and is MOVING...
Gina ducks into a store doorway.
Takes out her cell phone...
EXT. TIERGARTEN PARK - SAME the other cell phone in MARTIN'S hand.
EXT. TIERGARTEN PARK - SAME He answers it...
GINA They just sat down.
GINA Martin's gaze doesn't waiver.
GINA Up ahead of him, glimpsed through the crowds...
GINA Liz.
GINA He follows, watching, transfixed.
CLATTER of falling pins...
'Uncle Sam' logo.
Juke box Elvis serenading desultory daytime bowlers.
Jurgen hands the TICKET from Martin's book to a bored ATTENDANT.
She goes away...
returns a moment later with a purple bowling TOTE BAG.
Plonks it on the counter.
Rips off a ticket counterfoil - '21'.
Checks the time-stamp...
August.
Three months.
That'll be twenty-five Euros.
A beat.
Jurgen pays her, picks up the bag...
Parents buying tickets...
excited kids push through the turnstiles under the gilded elephants of the entrance.
Liz buys a ticket.
Passes beneath the elephant gate.
Martin starts to move forward...
then DOUBLES BACK as Smith arrives, hurrying, again checking his phone.
He pushes to the front of the line, pays his way in, eyes searching.
Martin moves out behind him, hat pulled low.
Watchful staff; soothing music.
Gina at a rack of dresses, anxiously looks out of the window, staring at Martin B and Bressler in the restaurant, a silent heated exchange...
INT. WEINHAUSE RESTAURANT - SAME Bressler in high form, reacting --
BRESSLER No!
BRESSLER God NO!
BRESSLER You're focusing on the science, but this...
BRESSLER .this is history.
BRESSLER You open the research before it's finished, the conglomerates gobble it up.
BRESSLER In the entire history of human development, name me one time when business has ever acted except in its own self-interest.
Martin B catches a waiter's eye, signals for the check.
Bressler catches this, looks to Martin B, questioning.
MARTIN B I'm sorry, it's my fault.
MARTIN B Another appointment I forgot.
BRESSLER It doesn't matter.
BRESSLER But see you, you say I am too cautious.
BRESSLER It's an idiot thing to say.
BRESSLER I'm a realist!
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME Liz wanders past some flamingos, checks a sign, heads in another direction.
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME Behind her, Martin keeps his distance, keeps his eyes on Smith who's shadowing Liz, one path over...
INT. WEINHAUSE RESTAURANT - SAME Martin B standing.
INT. WEINHAUSE RESTAURANT - SAME Bressler, collecting his bag and scarf...
MARTIN B I'm sorry if I offended you, Dr.
MARTIN B Bressler.
MARTIN B I just --
BRESSLER Don't be stupid.
BRESSLER You can't offend me.
BRESSLER We are colleagues, this is good discussion.
BRESSLER But please, Dr. Harris -- Power is an animal, all to itself.
BRESSLER It adapts, mutates to whatever form will best preserve it.
BRESSLER It's always closer than we know.
BRESSLER ON MARTIN B, extending a hand...
MARTIN B .Perhaps you're right.
Gina, crossing the street, searching the restaurant windows, the table empty, busboy gathering up plates.
P.O.V.
urgently searching.
Finds...
Bressler outside the restaurant getting into a taxi.
He's alone.
No sign of Martin B. Pulls out her phone...
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME Liz, following the winding path lower as it descends.
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME The sound of a cell-phone RING.
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME Liz glances back...
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME .Martin, pressed out of sight against a wall.
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME He SILENCES his phone, tucks it away.
EXT. TIERGARTEN PARK - SAME Martin B striding through the park toward the zoo...
EXT. TIERGARTEN PARK - SAME Gina way behind, trying to catch up.
EXT. TIERGARTEN PARK - SAME Dials again, Martin's phone going straight to voicemail.
Her slim shoulders; her hair tucked into a scarf against the rain, silhouetted in front of an underwater view.
The giant Polar Bear swims, inches in front of her.
LIZ'S FACE.
Her eyes, soft.
A smile...
which fades as she senses a presence.
Turns.
FACES us.
MARTIN Standing across from her in this protected space.
MARTIN A strange numbness.
MARTIN Doesn't know where to start...
MARTIN Liz.
MARTIN Just that syllable.
MARTIN She stares back, features tense.
LIZ What are you doing here?
MARTIN Liz.
MARTIN What's happening?
LIZ You're crazy -- you have to leave me alone.
MARTIN Why --?: I have to know why, Liz.
MARTIN Are they making you do this?
MARTIN Are they threatening you?
LIZ .How did you find me --
MARTIN The zoo.
MARTIN The Polar Bears.
You see?
I KNOW YOU, Liz.
You KNOW me...
Liz's eyes fixed on his.
She searches his face.
A long beat.
Her facade seems suddenly to crumble...
LIZ I can't...
MARTIN You can't what?
LIZ can't get out.
LIZ Can't leave.
LIZ They'll kill me.
Smith's path has veered him away from Liz's.
Frustrated, he's a little lost.
His eyes play over the entrance to the lower area, other women, also with umbrellas...
Martin B waiting in the ticket line at the gates...
Gina approaches, breathless.
Sees Martin B. Hangs back from the ticket line.
Spots a large party of school kids.
Gina steps past the line, confidently joins the group...
just another parent.
Swept through the turnstiles.
Behind her, Martin B steps up to the ticket window.
What are they making you do?
Is it about Fahad?
LIZ I...
LIZ I can't answer that.
MARTIN Come with me, right now.
MARTIN We can
LIZ No!
LIZ They'll kill us both!
MARTIN Who are they?
MARTIN She shakes her head, tormented.
LIZ Please.
LIZ Not now.
LIZ Not until we're safe.
LIZ Then I'll explain everything, I promise.
LIZ All I want is for us to get out alive.
LIZ You have to believe me...
LIZ Urgent look around.
LIZ Her eyes lock on his.
LIZ (CONT'D) Your case.
MARTIN My case...?
MARTIN She closes on him.
MARTIN A wave of emotion as she's almost in his arms, her hands on his face, searching his eyes.
LIZ Your briefcase.
LIZ It got left behind.
LIZ At the airport.
LIZ That's why you were going back there.
LIZ You need to find it...
In an hour, there's a chance for me to get away.
Meet me at the airport at three o'clock.
We can run together...
Martin's eyes.
Mind racing.
Eyes suddenly catching GINA, walking right by.
Moment's urgent eye contact.
The signal.
Martin B's here.
He's on his way...
What can he do?
He knows he can't stay.
Suddenly, Liz moves her face to his.
Kisses him on the lips.
Whispers...
LIZ (CONT'D) I love you.
LIZ (CONT'D) A beat.
LIZ (CONT'D) Martin steps back slowly.
LIZ (CONT'D) Their eyes hold.
LIZ (CONT'D) Then he turns, walks quickly away...
GINA Behind the glass of the penguin exhibit.
GINA She saw the kiss.
MARTIN Cuts up a small path rising up from the Polar Bear area.
MARTIN At the top he turns, hiding himself, looking back.
Smith and Martin B converge from opposite directions on Liz, speak at her, close, heated.
Smith pops open his phone.
Martin B GLARES at Liz, almost pushing her back against the glass.
She GLARES back up at him.
MARTIN .Nothing he can do now.
MARTIN He turns away, moves to the top of the path where Gina waits for him.
MARTIN They walk in silence...
GINA She's pretty...
GINA Martin doesn't acknowledge.
GINA Each face a mix of emotions.
A light rain.
JURGEN crosses the street to his building, carrying the bowling bag.
INT. JURGEN'S APARTMENT - SAME The phone on his desk starts RINGING.
INT. JURGEN'S APARTMENT - SAME No one to pick up.
Martin and Gina hurry across the street.
Cellphone to Martin's ear.
Listening to it RING...
Jurgen lumbers asthmatically up the stairs.
Gets to the fourth floor.
Sound of the PHONE RINGING above.
Trudges up the last flight...
.Phone STOPS RINGING just as Jurgen reaches the top.
He stops, wheezing.
An ENVELOPE propped against the door.
He picks it up.
Thumbs it open.
Takes out:
from the security camera at airport Immigration.
A couple at a desk.
Liz and Martin.
Unmistakably Martin.
JURGEN hears the phone START RINGING again inside his apartment.
JURGEN Fumbles in his pocket for the key.
Jurgen grabs the phone.
Puffing:
JURGEN Ja ?
Is that Ernst Jurgen?
JURGEN Yes, it is.
VOICE My name's Rodney Cole.
VOICE You left a message on my phone.
VOICE There were two from Martin as well.
VOICE What kind of trouble is he in?
Trains rumble and whoosh.
Booming ANNOUNCEMENTS.
Hurried commuters pushing past...
RODNEY COLE -- he's the academic colleague we've seen in Martin's memory flashes -- an avuncular man about ten years Martin's senior.
Talks on a cell phone:
COLE Oh my God...
COLE that's unbelievable, the poor man.
COLE Well here's the good news -- I've just arrived in Berlin...
COLE yes, I've been teaching in Leipzig, at the Hochschule fur Technik.
COLE I came up for the last day to hear Bressler's speech...
I'll come right over, it's not far...
No, it's no problem.
I appreciate it, Herr Cole...
Puts the phone down.
A beat.
Another look at the airport scans of Martin.
Studying them a moment.
Jurgen opens the bowling bag, up-ends it onto the table.
Bowling shoes, a shirt, a hand towel...
Taking a knife from the counter, Jurgen cuts around the bottom of the bag...
lifts away a false floor.
Reaches inside.
The contents hidden from us...
a shadow of tension crosses his face.
Then a slow, enigmatic smile.
the mournful HOWL of its whistle.
Jurgen turns off the gas.
Spoons Nescafe into a mug.
Opens a closet, reaches over a musty clutter of jars and boxes...
finds a rusted sugar tin.
Inside is a single ancient sachet of sweetener.
A beat, pensive.
He tears it open, adds it to the Nescafe.
He looks up.
Listening for...
anticipating...
the lively KNOCK at his door.
Jurgen opens the door...
it's RODNEY COLE, grinning...
shaking rain from his coat.
COLE Herr Jurgen?
JURGEN Dr. Cole...
JURGEN Please, come on in.
JURGEN Jurgen ushers him in.
JURGEN Leads them into the living room.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Drink?
JURGEN (CONT'D) I've a bottle labelled 'brandy', which is more than likely hair lacquer...
JURGEN (CONT'D) or some vodka my neighbor gave me after it made her husband go blind.
No, thank you...
JURGEN Maybe some coffee?
JURGEN I'm making some for myself.
COLE I'm good.
COLE Thanks.
COLE Cole looks around the tiny apartment.
COLE Sees the framed photos on the mantel.
COLE Looks closer.
COLE (CONT'D) You were in the military?
JURGEN The Stasi.
JURGEN In East Germany.
COLE Wow, wait till I tell my son.
COLE He loves all that Cold War stuff.
COLE Look at that car.
COLE What is that?
JURGEN A 'Zil'.
JURGEN Suspension of a donkey cart and smelt like a tannery.
JURGEN Vanished as quickly as the Wall.
JURGEN Cole studies the other pictures.
JURGEN Notices Martin's Rolex beside them.
JURGEN Jurgen pours the kettle into his mug.
COLE So.
COLE This business with Martin.
COLE A hell of a thing.
COLE How did he find you?
JURGEN Quite by chance, as it happens.
COLE Sounds like he was damn lucky.
COLE So, what can I do to help?
JURGEN Come with us to the authorities.
JURGEN Help them confirm his identity.
COLE The authorities?
COLE Jesus, it's that bad?
COLE A guy comes to you with a story like that.
COLE What made you take the case?
JURGEN Curiosity...
COLE Curiosity?
COLE Is that all?
JURGEN Professional curiosity.
JURGEN There's not much in this world left to interest an old spy like me...
JURGEN Cole's face tightens...
JURGEN his back still toward Jurgen.
JURGEN (CONT'D) a few questions I still think over.
JURGEN (CONT'D) One in particular.
JURGEN (CONT'D) From
when I worked for the Aufklarung: our foreign intelligence wing.
Cole still hasn't moved.
Discreetly slips open a button on his jacket.
Jurgen cradles his coffee, steam rising.
JURGEN (CONT'D) There was this rumor.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Of a US based assassination unit called Section 15.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Freelance, deniable.
JURGEN (CONT'D) They'd work for whoever would pay -- public sector, private sector.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Second-to-none in their planning and efficiency.
JURGEN (CONT'D) They never failed.
JURGEN (CONT'D) What's more, they were invisible.
JURGEN (CONT'D) They'd strike, and nobody would even know there had been foul play.
JURGEN (CONT'D) It was only rumor, of course...
JURGEN (CONT'D) Cole turning to face Jurgen.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Smile gone.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Glint of a gun inside his packet.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Jurgen looking steadily back at him.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Takes a deep gulp of coffee.
COLE You had fifteen minutes after I called.
COLE Why didn't you run?
JURGEN Where would I run from Section 15, Mr. Cole?
JURGEN I can hardly walk.
JURGEN The edge of a smile, another large gulp of the coffee.
JURGEN Jurgen sets down the cup.
JURGEN He wheezes...
JURGEN (CONT'D) Before I could get Chesterfields, I smoked sixty machorkas a day.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Filthy Soviet things.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Killed more Russians than Stalin.
JURGEN (CONT'D) My doctors assure me I'll soon be joining their list of casualties.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Cole looking back at him, impassive.
COLE I want to know how he found you.
COLE I want every number, every source you've contacted on his behalf.
JURGEN And then what?
JURGEN We shake hands and you go away?
JURGEN Cole reaches a hand inside his jacket...
JURGEN (CONT'D) There's no need for that.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Beat.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Cole's eyes flicker.
JURGEN (CONT'D) Jurgen's body tightening...
JURGEN (CONT'D) the coffee...
JURGEN (CONT'D) the empty sachet of sweetener...
CONTINUED (3) Cole looks at Jurgen.
CONTINUED (3) A moment's glimmer of respect.
CONTINUED (3) He doesn't move.
CONTINUED (3) His gaze lingering.
CONTINUED (3) Understanding.
JURGEN (CONT'D) You never think...
JURGEN (CONT'D) you'll have the courage to use it.
COLE But we do.
COLE The best of us.
COLE Jurgen coughs again.
COLE Suddenly sways.
COLE Puts a hand out to steady himself.
COLE Knocking over the mug of coffee...
COLE as the cyanide sweeps through him.
COLE Trembling hands clasp the edge of table.
COLE Building force.
COLE Shaking.
COLE His piercing
eyes never leaving Cole...
through the pain:
JURGEN Tell me...
JURGEN if he remembers everything.
JURGEN What then...?
JURGEN No answer.
JURGEN Jurgen's hands slip.
JURGEN He slumps forward, his head hammering down onto the table.
JURGEN A final convulsion.
JURGEN Then he's still.
JURGEN A long beat.
JURGEN Cole buttons his jacket.
JURGEN Slips on some gloves.
JURGEN Gently lifts Jurgen's head from the table top, rests it on a forearm, as though Jurgen were asleep rather than dead.
JURGEN Restoring some dignity to him.
JURGEN Cole goes to the mantel, wipes off the one framed photo he picked up.
JURGEN Takes Martin's Rolex, drops it into his pocket.
JURGEN He turns, casting an expert eye over the apartment...
JURGEN The legs of the stove...
JURGEN ever so slightly askew...
JURGEN The phone RINGS...
JURGEN RINGS...
JURGEN Cole ignores it, moves forward.
Martin hits re-dial on his cell.
Listens, frustrated.
The phone RINGING and RINGING.
He flips it shut.
Gina's eyes meet his.
A long beat.
She looks back out the window.
Sleeting rain streaks the glass.
Endless grey city-scape.
He tracks a clock: 1:40.
Looks back at Gina who senses his gaze, keeps hers straight out.
He finds a section of loose KICK-BOARD.
Carefully pries it away.
Reaches into the hole: The PHOTOGRAPH of Martin and Liz, arriving.
And Jurgen's NOTEBOOK.
He turns up the gas, feeds the photograph to the flames.
As he watches it burn, he leafs carefully through the notebook.
Cathedral-like, overcrowded.
Inaudible PAs.
Carts loaded with luggage.
Watchful POLICE and SECURITY.
Martin and Gina, heads down under caps, navigate a surge of passengers rushing out of the doors, clutching bags, competing for taxis in the pouring rain...
Martin stops.
Deja-vu overload.
His fractured memories.
Past and present merging.
The FACES.
The SOUNDS...
An AIRPORT SECURITY Man glances over, concerned.
Gina tracks the attention, moves into Martin, fake-romantic, her face close to his...
Martin.
C'mon...
Gina touching his face.
Bringing him back.
He glances to a clock on the wall: 2:10...
Martin and Gina wait at a counter.
Clock reads 2:25.
A WOMAN returns with a leather briefcase.
A name tag on the handle.
'Dr.
M.A.
Harris'.
Martin stares at it...
reaching for memories.
The woman checks her computer.
WOMAN May I see some identification?
WOMAN She looks up.
WOMAN Martin's expression distant...
GINA He doesn't have any.
GINA He was in an accident, that's why the bag was unclaimed...
MARTIN The combination.
MARTIN For the lock.
MARTIN It's 2...
MARTIN 8...
MARTIN 0...
MARTIN 6...
MARTIN A beat.
MARTIN The woman and Gina both looking at Martin.
MARTIN The woman enters the numbers.
MARTIN The locks pop open.
MARTIN She lifts the lid, picks something up.
MARTIN A pause...
MARTIN then her expression softens.
MARTIN She turns it toward Martin...
Filled with personal effects.
Sitting on top a US passport.
A long beat.
Martin's hands unsteady as he opens it...
His photo.
And his name...
Doctor Martin Harris.
Noisy and busy.
Gina uneasy...
watching Martin as he carefully examines each item in the case.
Everything familiar, yet strange.
His, but somehow not his.
a copy of 'Scientific American' magazine, a comb, some gum, a Newark Airport parking ticket.
His published paper -- the same edition Jurgen found at the library.
his leather wallet.
Martin studies it.
Identical to the one Martin B had.
Opens it...
New Hampshire Driver's license.
Credit cards.
Martin fumbles inside a pocket, pulls out...
the EXACT SAME PHOTO we saw in Bressler's lab of a younger Liz with a younger Martin B in Paris.
Except this time it's a younger Martin beside Liz-in the photo.
MARTIN gazing at it.
MARTIN He runs his fingers over its dock-eared corners, every bump and crease.
MARTIN Looks up to find Gina watching him.
MARTIN A long, awkward pause.
MARTIN She reaches over.
MARTIN Takes the photo from him.
MARTIN Studies it.
GINA Can you remember now...
GINA how you felt?
GINA Martin's silence hangs in the noise and activity around them.
GINA Gina handing back the photo.
GINA He stares down at Liz again as Gina stands, start to collect her things...
GINA (CONT'D) We shouldn't stay here, it's not safe for you...
GINA (CONT'D) Her voice trails off as she looks at Martin, really sees him in this moment.
GINA (CONT'D) He looks up at her, torn, back down at the pictures, the relics of his life, his memories, spread out in front of him.
GINA (CONT'D) He glances at the clock: 2:55...
GINA (CONT'D) Gina tracks his gaze...
GINA (CONT'D) gets it, takes a step back...
GINA (CONT'D) Oh, God.
GINA (CONT'D) I'm an idiot.
GINA (CONT'D) She's meeting you here.
GINA (CONT'D) Martin meets her gaze, open book.
MARTIN .Yes.
MARTIN I'm sorry.
MARTIN Yes.
MARTIN She's my wife.
MARTIN She's in danger.
MARTIN I have to --
GINA That's good.
GINA I'm happy for you.
GINA I have to go.
MARTIN No, wait.
MARTIN I meant what I said.
MARTIN We can take care of you.
MARTIN I can get you money, arrange --
Stop.
Be quiet.
You've got what you wanted.
You don't need me anymore and in case "we've" forgotten, I take care of myself very well.
She starts for the door.
Martin getting up...
MARTIN Gina stops, turns.
MARTIN A beat.
MARTIN Sadness, anger.
GINA One kiss and suddenly...
GINA Everything that's happened?
GINA To Biko?
GINA To us?
GINA -- I know, she's your wife.
GINA Like I said, I'm an idiot.
Goodbye, Martin.
She turns away again.
Martin, frozen, watches her go.
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME Gina keeps walking.
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME Pouring rain...
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME ROAR of traffic.
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME No look back.
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME She joins the line waiting for taxis.
Martin still sitting there.
The photo of him and Liz in Paris.
Sudden decision, snaps the briefcase shut...

A glance back.
People...
vehicles...
no sign of Martin.
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME Martin out of the doors.
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME Eyes frantically searching for Gina.

She steals a last look back at the terminal...
Hey, lady.
You ready...?
Gina's face suddenly lighting up...
she can see Martin!
Spins back to the TAXI DRIVER...
GINA Wait.
GINA There's another passenger.
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME Martin weaving quickly through the crowds toward her...
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME BUMPS PAST a man who looks back, his face lighting up...
MAN Martin.
MAN Martin...?
MAN Martin hesitates, turns.
MAN Sees...
MAN RODNEY COLE.
MAN Beaming smile.
MAN Martin stares at him, bewildered.
COLE Jesus, Martin, how are you doing?
MARTIN Rodney?
MARTIN What are you doing here?
COLE You called me, remember?
COLE You left a message on my machine.
MARTIN Yeah...
MARTIN but how did you know --?
Cole suddenly right up close.
Presses a rolled newspaper into Martin's side.
Cold steel of a concealed Qun.
COLE Stay one step ahead of me.
COLE Any move, I'll shatter your spine.
COLE His voice flat with menace.
COLE Martin's mouth opening...
MARTIN What are -- ?
COLE -- Go...
COLE Martin glancing round.
COLE Cole jerks him back, guiding him toward the passenger pick-up zone.
Gina looking back around.
Bemused.
Martin vanished again in the crowd.
Then a sudden stab of alarm...
A man she doesn't know carrying his case...
headed toward a parked commercial van.
Driver waiting for them.
She recognizes him...
SMITH.
Martin hustled into the back...
Van door shuts.
Engine starts.
A VOICE snaps us...
standing in front of Gina -- losing patience.
Miss.
I ain't got all day.
Mind racing.
Beat.
Points to a suitcase a few yards away.
GINA Help me with my bags, please.
GINA The driver goes to fetch the case.
GINA Is stopped by its OWNER.
GINA Raised voices.
GINA Moment's confusion.
GINA Then...
GINA .the SQUEAL of TIRES.
GINA The taxi driver spins around to see Gina gone and his own taxi pulling away.
GINA He YELLS after her, furious.
GINA But she's off in traffic...
Smith drives.
Deadly silence.
Martin motionless.
Cole opposite him with the gun, impassive.
Interior goes dim as Smith takes a hard right, into an ABANDONED PARKING STRUCTURE, taking a ramp, spiraling up.
dart between Cole and Smith.
Heart racing.
Struggling to make sense of things.
Cole studying him in quiet amazement.
Shakes his head.
Thinking out loud...
COLE My God...
COLE she's right.
COLE You're completely gone.
COLE You really think you are Martin Harris.
MARTIN What the hell Rod!
MARTIN You're my oldest friend!
MARTIN You know who I am.
MARTIN It's me...
MARTIN it's not that other guy.
MARTIN He's not --
COLE -- Martin Harris?
COLE You're right.
COLE He's not.
COLE He's the guy who took over for you after you went missing.
COLE Exasperated, Cole leans forward.
COLE Spelling it out.
But you're not Martin Harris either.
There is no Martin Harris.
Martin staring at him.
Blank.
Confused.
Scared.
COLE (CONT'D) Martin Harris doesn't exist.
COLE (CONT'D) You invented him.
COLE (CONT'D) He's your legend.
COLE (CONT'D) A fiction you created.
COLE (CONT'D) You made him up as a cover to get Bressler to invite you to the conference...
MARTIN No...
MARTIN That's insane.
MARTIN Liz, she----
COLE 'Liz'...?
COLE Your "wife"?
COLE How do you think she feels about all this?
COLE You two were a good team, then you go and get Norman fucking Rockwell on her.
MARTIN That's not...
MARTIN she...
COLE -- they aren't real memories.
COLE Don't you get it?
COLE Martin Harris is a fabrication...
COLE but you've one and filled in the caps, invented a whole damn life for him.
COLE They could write a textbook about you!
COLE Jesus --!
COLE Martin's face.
COLE Spinning.
COLE Refusing to believe.
COLE The Van SCREECHES to a stop, Smith gets out pops the doors.
COLE The distant sound of the city traffic, a light wind, whistling.
INT. TAXI CAB - SAME Gina, driving through traffic, searching, no sign of the van...
INT. TAXI CAB - SAME then her gaze LOCKING ACROSS THE RIVER, four stories up on a parking garage: The white van.
INT. TAXI CAB - SAME She hauls the wheel over, Taxi sliding through a U-turn.
Martin is tossed out onto the asphalt.
Picks himself up, trying to orient...
The structure abandoned, broke.
No side rails, just pavement to the edge.
Trash and graffiti everywhere.
Desolate.
Cole approaches, losing it now.
Boiling with rage:
COLE All that studying...
COLE planning.
COLE Hell, you even had us take out that kid after we ripped off his thesis.
COLE A year of prep and you try to screw it up...
COLE we do everything to bring you back in, but you go on trying to screw it up.
COLE Do you know how much time you've wasted?
COLE It's Thanksgiving for Christ's sake!
COLE I should be eating turkey with my kids, not here cleaning up after some wacko who bumps his head and decides his cover story's for real.
COLE Martin's eyes...
COLE staring back at him.
COLE Crumbling...
MARTIN But...
MARTIN I...
MARTIN who am I...?
MARTIN A pause.
MARTIN Cole shakes his head, pats him on the cheek.
COLE You.
COLE You were my best boy.
COLE .suddenly Cole SLAMS a fist into Martin's stomach.
COLE Martin doubles over.
COLE Cole WHIPS the gun across his FACE.
COLE Kicks him AGAIN.
COLE Martin on his hands and knees, spits blood.
COLE Cole glaring down at him.
COLE Disgusted.
COLE Smith covers Martin as Cole moves into the van, empties out a junkie's works: dropper with needle, bottle top, cotton balls, lighter.
COLE Expertly cooks up a fix of brown heroin.
Draws it into the syringe, glancing back:
COLE (CONT'D) Look at you now.
COLE (CONT'D) Nobody.
COLE (CONT'D) A no- one.
COLE (CONT'D) Just another dead junkie...
COLE (CONT'D) Streak of CONCERN as the sound of tires screeching reaches them.
COLE (CONT'D) Cole looks up in time to see Gina's taxi, rounding the ramp, accelerating towards them!
COLE (CONT'D) Smith steps forward, gun raised, firing!
INT. TAXI CAB - SAME Gina DUCKS as bullets pierce the front windscreen.
INT. TAXI CAB - SAME The image of Smith, firing, grows large...
Taxi catches Smith, carrying into the van, crushing him as the two vehicles slide towards the edge...
Cole is HURLED across the van like a rag-doll, his legs are crushed between buckling rows of seats as...
The van SLIDES with the TAXI'S IMPACT...
front wheels pushed off the garage edge...
teeters, see-sawing.
Gina scrambles from the wrecked taxi.
Runs toward Martin, lying on the ground.
Pulls Martin away, arm around him...
MARTIN Wait!
MARTIN WAIT!
MARTIN Martin breaks free, walks unsteady to the rear of the van, locks eyes with Cole, trapped, clawing towards the back...
MARTIN Martin puts a hand out...
MARTIN and takes his briefcase.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Is it true...?
COLE Caught, the van TEETERING...
COLE Sneers at Martin, starts to speak..
COLE Eyes go WIDE as...
COLE THE VAN...
COLE TIPS...
COLE FALLING off the edge, Smith's body going with it...
COLE disappears.
COLE A moment of calm silence and then CRUNCH!
COLE A dull sick crash as the Van hits below.
MARTIN Stares down at the wreck.
MARTIN Mind spinning...
MARTIN Gina comes up, touches his shoulder.
GINA Martin...
GINA He turns, MOVES.
GINA She chases after him...
Pouring rain.
Vehicles hiss over the bridge.
Gina catches up to Martin.
Her voice straining above the traffic:
GINA (CONT'D) Martin!
GINA (CONT'D) Stop!
GINA (CONT'D) Martin, what's wrong...
GINA (CONT'D) Martin!
MARTIN Jurgen...
MARTIN we were going to meet...
MARTIN I have to see him.
GINA We've got to go...
GINA leave Berlin.
GINA We've got to get out of here...!
MARTIN I have to!
MARTIN Martin's face.
MARTIN Blood streaking in the rain.
MARTIN Absolute.
MARTIN A long beat.
MARTIN Gina takes a deep breath.
A cafe looking onto the Kochstrasse, Checkpoint Charlie.
Rain mists the windows.
Mostly empty...
TWO FIGURES, sitting in the shadows.
Martin and Gina.
He STARES down, lost, shivering -- not from the cold.
GINA Martin...?
He glances up, lost, looks away.
Gina takes his hand in hers, presses it to her lips.
Holds it.
Places it against the skin of her neck and collar bone.
Stares at him.
He looks up...
the intimacy.
From far away:
MARTIN he told me I'm one of them...
MARTIN the things he said...
MARTIN the things he said I've done...
MARTIN How can I be that person?
GINA Listen to me.
GINA You're not.
GINA You're not...
GINA Martin, looking up at her, lost.
GINA His eyes back to the clock on the wall: 6.15...
GINA Martin closes his eyes.
GINA Gina reaches
out.
Quiet.
Gentle:
GINA (CONT'D) Martin.
GINA (CONT'D) He's not coming.
GINA (CONT'D) A long beat.
GINA (CONT'D) He nods, heavy-hearted.
GINA (CONT'D) She's right.
GINA (CONT'D) As they stand to go...
GINA (CONT'D) door JINGLES...
a FIGURE peering around anxiously ..
FRAU BRUNNER -- Jurgen's neighbor, breathless determination as she hurries over.
The bowling tote b in her hands.
She thrusts it at Martin, talking rapidly and urgently in German.
Gina translates...
GINA (CONT'D) She's sorry she's late.
GINA (CONT'D) She says Jurgen gave it to her.
GINA (CONT'D) He said that you'd know...
GINA (CONT'D) that Martin Harris would know what to do...
GINA (CONT'D) Slowly, almost dazed, Martin takes the bag.
GINA (CONT'D) Frau Brunner looking at him intently, still talking...
GINA (CONT'D) Herr Jurgen told her to wish you good luck...
GINA (CONT'D) that it was a pleasure knowing Dr. Harris.
GINA (CONT'D) Martin looks at her, nods slowly.
GINA (CONT'D) A beat.
GINA (CONT'D) Finally...
MARTIN Thank you.
CONTINUED (2) Frau Brunner nods.
CONTINUED (2) A pause.
CONTINUED (2) Then she turns, bustles away out the door, into the rain.
CONTINUED (2) Martin looks at Gina.
CONTINUED (2) In the half light of the cafe window, he unzips the bag...
Shoes...
towel...
shirt...
digs down, pushing them aside.
The floor of the bag neatly cut out.
Revealing...
A hidden compartment.
Thick roll of BILLS...
Euros, US dollars, Swiss francs...
and TWO PASSPORTS...
Canadian.
He takes one out, flips it open.
An entry stamp: 'Berlin...
August 28th.' Finds the photo page...
It's him.
Martin!
But fair-haired, and in horn-rimmed glasses.
The name...
'Tim Carmichael'...
a Canadian citizen.
The second passport...
'Rachael Carmichael'.
It's Liz...
with short, dark hair.
The Liz from his recurring memory.
MARTIN (CONT'D) No...
MARTIN (CONT'D) No...
Liz towels short dark hair.
Door of a hotel bathroom.
Liz turning...
smiling.
Embroidered on the towel...
the 'H...
I...' now visible in detail: 'Hotel Imperial'...
His chair falling.
Gina moves to help, he pushes her away.
MARTIN (CONT'D) No!
MARTIN (CONT'D) Leave me alone.
MARTIN (CONT'D) He stumbles away, pushing towards the bathroom.
Martin lurches in, locks it, goes to the small sink, STARES at himself in the mirror.
MARTIN No...
the door to the Eisenhower suite bedroom...
moving through the suite...
towards the bathroom...
SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN He puts hand out against the memory, covers his reflection.
SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN His eyes stare back at him all the same...
.Liz towelling short, dark hair.
She smiles up.
Lips moving...
LIZ Are you ready...?
LIZ .and MARTIN ENTERS THE FRAME, hair cut and colored differently.
LIZ There's drywall dust on his hands and clothing.
LIZ As he leans to kiss her, we CONTINUE...
LIZ .INTO THE BATHROOM...
LIZ to a wall beside the shower...
LIZ panels cut away, exposed plumbing.
LIZ Something integrated into the wall behind the pipes.
LIZ MOVING CLOSER...
LIZ Semtex plastigue...
LIZ circuits and wires...
LIZ diii? 1/2  video timer connected to a high-tech DETONATOR...
SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN Shaking his head, knowing.
SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN Tears streak, he wipes them away, hard.
SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN His fingers find his shirt pull it open...
SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN .STARES at his own body in the mirror.

MARTIN I made him up...
MARTIN I made him up to kill a man I've never met.
Gina STARTS, puts the paper down.
Martin is at the table, looking down at her.
His emotions sick, his gaze rotten.
GINA The entry stamp in your passport.
GINA You were in Berlin three months ago...
GINA Martin, like a statue.
GINA Voice, dead.
MARTIN Prince Fahad is going to be assassinated today.
MARTIN There's a bomb in the suite.

Martin pushes them into the alley next to cafe, jams the bag into her arms.
MARTIN Take this...
MARTIN get out of Berlin.
MARTIN Gina shaking her head.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Take it and go!
MARTIN (CONT'D) Get as far away from me as you can.
GINA I'm not leaving you!
GINA Listen to me: Maybe you're not the man who went into the water.
GINA But you are the man I pulled out...
GINA Martin, staring into his reflection on the wet street...
GINA (CONT'D) Martin, there's no way you can show your face at the hotel.
GINA (CONT'D) Everyone is looking for you.
WHAM!
MARTIN LURCHES UP AT GINA!
He SLAMS her back against the brick wall, his hand around her neck, cutting off her air, literally lifting her feet off the ground.
Look at me.
Look at me...
Gina SPUTTERS, tries to draw air.
Her eyes LOCK on his.
MARTIN (CONT'D) .Is this what you want?
MARTIN (CONT'D) Is this the person you still want to help.
You should have let me drown...
She sputters, eyes start to roll back in her head, losing consciousness.
Martin RELEASES and she drops in the dirt water of the Alley, hands and knees, GASPING for breath.
Martin stares down at her.
He picks up the bag, drops it in front of her face...
MARTIN (CONT'D) Pure instinct and adrenaline.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Gina grabs the bag, stumbles across the street, HORNS BLARE as cars swerve to avoid her...
MARTIN (CONT'D) And she's gone.
Martin walks...
numb.
He waits at street corners, crosses with lights, moves through the city...
Martin stands at the broken railing where Gina's taxi plunged into the water seven days ago.
The tire marks are there.
The railing is half-repaired, half taped off.
He stares down into the oily black water, toes near the edge...
weight shifting...
then his knees give.
He sits hard, his hands moving uselessly, almost on their own.
Tears flow freely.
Sobs RACK his body.
to where Gina stands, hidden in shadows.
She's followed him here.
Now frozen, watching him suffer.
Lit up for the big night.
Taxis and limos pulling in.
In the lobby, beautiful people mingle with the celebrities of science.
Herr Strauss scans the crowd, watchful.
INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME Two attentive SECURITY GUARDS scan monitors, roll through different views of the hotel.

Martin, buttoning the last button of the jacket, moves into the hotel.
No longer lost.
Here to make amends.
PRINCE FAHAD, flanked by his entourage, arrives at the door to the Eisenhower Suite.
Hum of a party from within.
Security KNOCKS.

FAHAD Martin B engrossed in a conversation...
BRESSLER Look, I probably have it somewhere...
BRESSLER Perhaps my wife -- BRESSLER, held at the door by Fahad's security, searching his pockets for an invitation.
BRESSLER (CONT'D) I'm late.
BRESSLER (CONT'D) Very un-German of me.
I don't think the professor needs an invitation.
He is, after all, the reason we are all here.
Bressler steps in, takes Liz's outstretched hand.
He looks her up and down.
Matter-of-fact.
BRESSLER Now I can see why somebody would pretend to be Martin.
BRESSLER Liz laughs, her face lighting up...
BRESSLER then chillincj as Bressler's TWO DAUGHTERS appear behind him, smiling shy.
LIZ .I didn't realize the girls were coming this evening.
FAHAD But of course.
FAHAD Lily and Laurel are the real reason any of us put up with Leo at all.
FAHAD Fahad bends down and the girls run to him, a familiar face.
FAHAD Fahad hoists one up, takes the other by the hand.
FAHAD ON LIZ.
FAHAD Hard beat.
FAHAD Looking to Martin B who stares back, cool.
FAHAD Liz nods, accepting the casualties.
FAHAD She takes Bressler's coat, reaches for his computer bag.
LIZ Let me take these...
LIZ Bressler hesitates a moment, then lets go...
BRESSLER Separation anxiety.
BRESSLER Just leave it there, if you could.
BRESSLER He gestures to a sideboard in open sight.
LIZ Of course...
She turns, hangs up his coat.
As she does so...
her fingers slip inside the laptop bag.
Slide a tiny Bluetooth connection card into the computer's bus port.
Liz turns away.
Smile gone.
Moves down the hall towards...

Bressler steps away from Fahad, heads over to his computer.
Stops as Liz comes out of the bedroom.
BRESSLER Ah, Mrs. Harris...
LIZ Checking on your baby again?
BRESSLER I can't help it.
LIZ Why don't you just wear it?
LIZ As a nerdy accessory?
LIZ Here, turn around.

the details...
Gina reaches out, takes Martin's arm.
Draws him closer.
MARTIN (V.0.) (CONT'D) I don't know who I am now, what I would have done.
MARTIN (V.0.) (CONT'D) But one thing's for sure...
MARTIN (V.0.) (CONT'D) I'm not the man I was.
