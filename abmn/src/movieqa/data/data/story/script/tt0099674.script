THE GODFATHER PART III
Written by
Mario Puzo & Francis Ford Coppola
The screen is black.
First we hear the sound of a single trumpet playing slowly and sadly, the notes faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow streets of some old hill village in Sicily.
Now, confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us and another, and as our surroundings become more visible, we discover that we are moving through a pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight.
Now,.
suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe.
It is a clear, cold morning in September of Nineteen Fifty-nine.
We now see the Corleone compound at lakeside, half-hidden by pines and firs.
We move toward it, past the gates and guard houses, past the guest houses, past the kennels for the guard dogs, and finally to the front driveway of the main house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by a Chauffeur and a pair.
of large dark-headed men named Al Neri and Rocco Lampone.
Rocco limps slightly.
As suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the car, the front door to the main house opens and Tom Hagen, a trim, serious, balding man in a business suit, appears He crosses to the corner of the house and looks off.
Standing by the shore of the lake is a little boy,.
Tony Adams Corleone, aged about ten.
The boy, dressed for travel, is looking off at the lake, his back to- ward us.
As he looks out at the lake we might sense that he is troubled and puzzled, although he is managing to keep his expression stoic.
Hagen can be seen in the background, by the house 9 After a moment:
HAGEN Tony.
Time to go.
There is a beat and Tony composes himself, turns and moves up toward the house and Tom Hagen.
The heavy, black sedan is loaded.
Connie Corleane and a Housekeeper, in uniform, are bringing Mary, about five, out to the car.
She too is dressed for travelling.
As they put her into the car --
CONNIE In you get ---
Will.
Daddy be at the airport?
as Tom and Tony come up.
HAGEN No.
HAGEN Ere wanted me to tell you both how sorry he was.
Aunt Connie ..- ?
Connie would apparently prefer to avoid answering any questions.
CONNIE 8e sure and give my love to your mother.
NERI It isn't like you won't be back from time to time.
I' 11 bet we' 11 all.
be together for Christmas.
Wait and see.
Tony gems into the car.
He locks out the window to-- ward the house.
We begin XXI-N Ti.
TZS 2 C 2=17"s
Hagen is the last one into the car.
As it starts down the driveway on its way to the airport in Reno, Connie, Lampone, Neri and the Housekeeper all wave.
The auto- matic gate at the foot of the driveway opens.
The Guard at the gate flicks a half-salute as the Limousine passes through.
TEE GROUP r n FONT OF EOQSE As the group breaks, Connie and the Housekeeper going back inside, Neri and Lampone drifting off, we pan up- ward to a window in the second-story and zoom in.
Michael Corleone has moved the curtain aside with one hand and is looking after the disappearing limousine, his expression unreadable-but somehow sad.
We are close on Tony, looking out the window of the airliner, his own expression matching that of his father.

our Nation is and has been histor- ically the symbol of freedom, of justice and opportunity and its pecui.iar strength is that no matter what our individual background --
We are close on a young man, Anthony Adams (Corleone), in the uniform of a Midshipman of the Naval Academy at Annapolis.
We are pulling back as the speaker -- who is Arne Grundellius, the Secretary of State -- continues, his accent faintly Scandinavian.
-- there are no limits to the goals to which we can each legitimately aspire.
And now, as an unpopular war is ended in East Asia and we set our sights on new goals, I leave you with the words of another Sailor --- We continue to pull back to discover that we are at the Navy and Marine Corps stadium.
It is a late Spring day and in the early-middle Nineteen Seventies.
The Midshipmen, their parents and guests, are gathered for- the graduation ceremonies.
' Our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all.
To this solemn purpose we call on the young, the brave and the strong, and the free.
Heed my call.

?EA aR=G TONY As the graduating Midshipmen give their last full- throated response and skim their hats into the air, Tony -- half a beat behind the others -- does like- wise.
We pull back and pan upward to the explosion of white hats arching through the air.
We pick up a man named Stu Palmateer moving th-rough the group of strolling Midshipmen and their guests.
Palmateer, is a poised, pleasant, tough man abcut forty, dressed in the unifora of a Marine Caotai.n_ He spots Tony in a group with his guests, near the 0 statue of Tecumseh.
Tony is standing with Kay, Mara Hagen and Al Nexi.
Tony turns as --
Congratulations, Tony.
TONY Thank you, Sir.
Captain Palmateer, I'd like to present you to my Mother, Mrs.

I'm sorry to drag him off this way, Mam.
Ready?
TONY See you all tonight.
TONY Tony kisses his mother and he and Palmateer move off.
We pick up a car coming along the Washington Beltway approaching the CIA turnoff near Langley, Virginia.
We pan with it, then continue to pan over to a road sign which reads, "Central Intelligence Agency".
Palmateer is driving.
Tony sits next to h.m.
They make the turnoff to the CIA, go up the access road, 0 come to a stop at the entrance.
As the Marine Guard comes out of the guardhouse and up to the car, Palmateer is taking out his identification.
Palmateer and Tony, on foot now, move up to the build- ing.
They move through the front doors.
We are in he gigantic foyer of the CIA building.
The camera is focused on the CIA motto, etched boldly into the white marble wall.
It reads: "YE SHALL M TOW T=
We pan off the motto to pick up Palnateer and Tony as they move through the great, columned rcom toward the desk at the end.

CIA BtJILAING (LOBBY) - DAY Within the foyer is another crate separating the foyer from the inner sanctum of the building itself.
We are on the Gate Guards as they check the badges and passes of those entering.
They nod Palmateer and Tony through the gate.
We pan them toward the bank of varicolored elevators.
As they go to the elevators we hear ---
This is a.
preliminary interview, not binding on either party.
The next step, if it's agreed to take that step, would be a session with the Assessment and Evaluation sec- tion.
Psychological testing.

Ends with a polygraph test.
We are on the elevator doors as they open and Palmateer and Tony emerge.
They walk down the corridor with its bare, off-white walls.

After a moment:
TONY I really don't know if I can help you very much, Mister :Korehouse.
MOREHOUSE Let me ask you a personal question, Tony..
MOREHOUSE Do you love your Country ,-

We are an the terrace of a pleasant restaurant over- looking Washington D.C. The dome of the Capitol building is impressively floodlit as are the Washi:g- ton monument and the White :louse.
Tony and Hagen are leaning on the terrace railing, looking out.
A Waiter has just finished pouring coffee for them.
As the Waiter moves off, Tony throws a look at $agen, then:
TONY Well?
Let me make sure I'm clear on this.
You're telling me that the Govern- ment would like the Corleone family to perfatm a service for them -- probably involving some friends of

Tony is connected to the desk ensemble by three appara- tuses: a blood pressure cuff attached to his arm,.
an accordian tube around the chest to measure changes in breathing rhythms; a hand-held device with electrodes which measures changes in perspiration or galvanic skin response.
The Third Interrogator sits at the desk behind Tony, asking questions slowly and checking the three styluses on the rolling graphs.

HAGEN Come in.
HAGEN Come in This way.
HAGEN I (to Secretary) No calls, :Maggie.
This is a very plush room with heavy carpets, a long polished table and a large portrait of the Union's ex- president, Danny Devito.

Ten-thi.-ty last night.
Big problems.
I understand and S sympathize, but you've had our proposal for a month ---
Brady crosses to the head of the board table where he opens a :older and starts riffling through some papers.
As he does so, Eagen opens his briefcase.
BAGEN '1f you've misplaced it, I have a copy of the package plus.
BAGEN a summary of Genco International's assets and projected profits based on audited financial statements with additional data supplied by our Comptroller.

BRADY There's been a big reduction in our c fitment to new construction loans.
How Long has that policy been in effect?
BRADY Let me read you something.
as Brady withdraws a newspaper cut-out, obviously an editorial, from the folder.

Cute?
'It.
is precisely men like Patrick Brady -- who took over the Pres- idency of the I3D when the former President, Danny Devito was packed off to prison, who must be watched by the SEC.
Because of the tremen- dous economic power of the anion Pension Funds, these men -- with their syndicate connections --- are putting the Underworld in a position to dominate the American economy

After a moment Brady shakes his head and turns back to Hagen.
BRADY t'm sorry, Tom.
BRADY :Such as I love and respect cur former president, I don't have any burning urge to end up rooming with him at Leavenworth.
Before you give me your final re- fusal., I'd like to say one thing ---
BRADY You've just had my final refusal, Hagen.
BRADY The answer is no.
BRADY i ANOTHER ANGLZ as Hagen looks at Brady for a moment, then starts
putting papers back into his briefcase.
As he does so:
BRADY No hard feelings.
BRADY It's just a policy decision of the Board.
BAGEN I understand and I thank you for your time ---
I'll see you around, Pat.
BRADY What's that supposed to mean?
It means I'll see you around.
BRADY What am t supposed to do?

Hagen has packed his papers into his briefcase.
Now he nods at Neri and as both turn, and start toward the
BRADY Wait a minute.
BRADY Hagen turns back.
BRADY Brady comes up with the Genco Inte.r- national loan application.
BRADY Take this along with you in case you run out of toilet paper on 0 the flight back to Vegas.
3agen takes the application from Brady, then cuietly: E ,Gr 3 Don't ever think that the Corleone Tamily is finished, Mister Brady.
That would be a mistake.
Hagen and Neri now turn and exit.
Brady is looking after them.
Gradually the bravado drains from his big, pink, Irish face and he crosses to the telephone and picks it up.
BRADY Gat me Sam Maatrocina.

including the canopied afterdeck of %laatrocina's lovely yacht, moored among others of its type in a splendid :forth Shore Long Island marina.
Pat Brady, looking out of place in his suit and city shoes,atands trying to light a cigar with a table lighter.
Hello Sam.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
We pull back slightly as Maatrocina --- in neat yacht- ing whites and deck shoes - comes up followed by a cold-looking man, Ralph Augusto, Maatrocina's hood.
No bother at all.
Light the man's cigar for him, Ralph..
As Augusta comes up, takes the lighter from Brady and sets about the business of lighting the big, Union

As Maatrocina leans across with the grapes again:
MAATROCINA Do me a favor..
MAATROCINA One grape.
MAATROCINA I grow 'em at my own place.
MAATROCINA They're de- licious.
MAATROCINA As Brady takes a grape, Maatrocina looks over at Ralph
AUGUSTO ANOTHER ANGI.
AUGUSTO - FEATURING AUGu STO As he nods almost iimperceptibly, gets un and goes,
We pick up Elizabeth Ann Dunne, about 30.
She is a television personality, mainly an interviewer of celebrities, although sometime a Newsweman and talk- show performer.
She is poised, attractive, warm, hirp.
She is coming out of an office.
She crosses through the newsroom with its teletypes and general sense of activity.
A Cameraman comes up to her:
You ready, Liz?
f i fteen minutes.
Out in front.
We follow her out of the newsroom, dawn a hallway and around a corner and in through a.
door rrar!ced, "Projec- tion Room One".
Elizabeth comes into the projection room, pausing in the doorway as her eyes adjust to the change in light.
We see that Tony, in miform, is the only otter person in the projection 'roem.
Tony takes out a cigarette lighter.
TONY Here.
As Tony flicks the lighter on:
Thank you.

She looks over, catches his eye, smiles.
as Tony and Elizabeth approach her apartment on a quiet, Georgetown side street.
The cold, faintly blue light of the- street lamp at the corner throws leaf shadows on their faces as they come up to the front door..
She opens the door, steps to one side and gestures him in.
One dr iak, ckayr?
We are close on a picture of Elizabeth and Arne Grundellius, the Secretary of state, whom we might remember by sight as the Speaker at Tony's gradu- ation.
The picture is in.?orral, taken at an open- ing night at Kennedy Center.
We pull back to include Tony, locking at the picture as Elizabeth comes up with a couple of drinks.

SANTINO Frankie was in that little shit storm on the ferry boat.
CROCE The whole thing don't make sense to me.
All Z know is Al got a phone call from that, nephew of his, Tommy, who runs numbers in Staten Island.
SANTINO Fucking punk.
It was something about Al's sister being sick bad with the ptomaine or I something.
We walked right into it.

The nephew?
Nobody seen him since.
SANTINO Ask me he's out in the Narrows with about eight slot machines tied around his neck.

The tenor of the group is subdued, although the tensions of the day are beginning to ease.
We pick up Fraakie who is guiding Tony through the room.
Santino always liked the old place.
He picked it up after Pentangeli knocked himself off.

Croce has a heaping plate of, food.
He pauses, shaking his head.

Tony nods.
All are seating themselves as:
Would you care for a little wine?
A little Anisette?
No?
All right.
I've invited L berto Croce to sit in with us-because of his strong connections in Latin America and in the exile comarunity down in Florida -- and because he's a trusted and valued friend of the Corl eone family.
And now,, if your friends in Langley have decided that you're not a Russian spy, perhaps you can tell as the nature of the service they'd like us to perform.
TONY It's a political assassination.
TONY The target is Asmanda Vidal.
Santino, whose attitude has been somewhat sardonic throughout, now breaks out in a bray of laughter.
Tony turns on his cousin, then coldly and quietly:
TONY If it's too much for you, just say so.
TONY M can break this off right now --- Santino, taken aback at the cold authority in Tony's manner, turns for support.
SANTINO What did I say, for God sake.

There's a second phase to this operation.
It consists a spread- ing confusion -- planting explos- ives -- the Police Barracks -- the Central.

which will hopefully trigger an uprising of the Anti -Vi"'aiista forces.
SANTINO I thought these bastards wanted a hit --?- .(then) They're locking for World War Three.
What do you think, Rocco?
As Rocco Lempone -- who walks with a limp as a souvenir of his service in World War Two-- thinks about it, then:

Of course, financial arrangements will have to be worked out --
TONY There's no problem there.
TONY Every- thing will be handled through me and in cash.
HAGZN You can tell your friends that they have a deal.
TONY. Good.
Tell them this too --- what the Corleone family wants for its part in this operation is the uncondi- tional pardon of Danny DeVito.
And that will have to come first.
TONY I don't know if they'll accept that.
RAGE It's a non-negotiable condition.
We'll start getting things lined up, but we won't move until Danny walks out of Leavenworth.

We are in a swampy backwater on the West Coast of Florida, south at Fort Meyer.
Hacked out of the everglades is a clearing on which a tourist acccmmo- dation has been built.
It is called Tarpon Lodge and signs announce "Cold Beer", "Boat Rentals" and "Tourist Accoammdations".
There is a small pier.
as a small, commercial fishing boat comes chugging up the bayou and blows its whistle.

Permit me to present my companions -- Indio, Borracho, Padre Pepe, El Fararon, Arrigo and my brother, Jorge.
The members of the assault team -- the Indian, the Drunk, the Priest, the Pharoah, Arrigo who looks like a pimp, and the romantic, fire-eating younger brother -- are introduced to Tony individually.
Xd lib greetings, then to Barcenas:
TONY Are you read-!?
ROBERTO For many years.
As they move into the hanger:
ROBERTO Z understand from Senor Croca that the idea with the diving suit did not work out.
There were a few problems.
ROBERTO But the other is.
ROBERTO fine?
TONY Yes.
TONY You've been in.
TONY touch with your underground?
Everything is arranged.
At one side of the hangar we see crates of various weapons.
Boxes of hand grenades, mortars and mortar shells.
Sub-machine guns caked in cosmolene, LAW rockets, field radios.
So on.
As Tony and Roberto come in, followed by the others:
TONY we got you BARS and Carbines plus ten, thirty calibre light machine guns, and ten, four-point t o inch mortars with a thousand rounds of high explosive and a thousand, rounds of white phosphorous.
Tony is pointing out the various boxes and crates:

We zoom back ---
We are on Rocco La=pone, who is standing by the window, looking out onto the pool area.
As he turns:

We are pulling back.
Also present in the large, attrac- tive office, are Tom Hagen, Danny DeVito and Sant no Corleone, who is at the bar fixing drinks.
SANTINO Half an hour late.

That means he's willing to talk like a reasonable man.
Tell A3..ieri about it.
What you've got to understand, Rocco, is that what happened to Al was business.

We are as the sky over the bay of Armando Vidal's Capitol.
It is the Fifth Anniversary of his revol- ution and a fireworks display is taking place over the bay.
Sky rockets are arching upward over the waters, exploding in cascades of red, green and gold.
We are on an impromptu exhibition on a street corner.
A big, marvelous looking black Girl, in almost nothing, circles with a lean Latino almost touching but not quite, in a hip grinding mambo .
ANOTSER ANGLE as the crowd laughs and cheers them on.
Aqua!
We move up to a loud speaker attached to an ornate and bunting festooned.lampost.
From the speaker we hear:
But make no mistake, any of you -- you of the North American delega- tion in particular.
We welcome you to our Count=y -- but the days of exploitation are over.

VIRAL The blood of our martyrs is still too fresh on our pavement.
VIRAL We will be friends and neighbors, but never again slaves to Imperialism.
VIRAL A young Latino, and we will recognize him as Ar=igo, has moved to Tony's side.
VIRAL As the cheers have erupted once more, Amigo, with'a brief nod of the head, indic- ates that Tony shouldfol:ow him.
As Arrigo goes, Tony looks after him briefly, then over to the American Delegation including Lucas, the Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs; Cariock, the Speaker of the House and several prominent liberal Senators including McKissick of Utah and the elegant Harthaiemew of Pennsylvania.
Also in the delegation, in uniform, is Stu Palmateer.
The older man's eyes meet with Tony's for a brief moment.
He has seen the exchange.
He watches as Tony leaves, then looks over toward u_agudo, Vidal's
VIRAL Chief of Police.
VIRAL The harsh, heavy Policeman is laugh- 1 ing at something Vidal has said, seemingly paying no attention to Tony's exit.
As Tony is crossing the lobby, Elizabeth Ann Dunne, followed by 'a small entourage, enters.
Half a pace behind her is Kenny Morton, her producer and behind them are three men carrying portable TV equipment, cameras, tripods, batteries, so on.

Elizabeth crosses off toward the desk, Tony looks after her for a moment, puzzled, then crosses out.
As Tony comes out of the hotel and crosses the garden grounds toward the street, we see that a fireworks display is still in progress.
Throngs of Merry-makers are moving along the wide, palm-lined avenue that follows the curve of the bay.
Many are in cost=e.
Some play instruments.
Others have bongo drums.
The atmosphere is frenetic.
There is.
a pervasive beat.
The whole city seems to throb with it.
We are on Arrigo who stands outside the flaw of traffic, cigarette in his mouth, patting his pockets for a match.

Some are studio portraits.
Some are grainy blow-ups of snapshots.
Tony crosses to the table of pictures.
As Tony looks, we are moving from picture to picture.
The first is a wedding portrait taken on Connie's wedding day.
Carlo is kissing the Bride.
The God- father stands, proud and uncom.fortable in his tuxedo.

There is a photograph of the three brothers, Sonny, Michael and 'redo, their arms around each other, at an outing someplace.
Sonny is in the middle of a big grin.
Fredo looks shy and scared.

Morehouse and Palmateer are in the office.
Their atti- tudes are.
less than cordial as Tony enters.
MOREHOUSE Come in Adams, sit down.
MOREHOUSE I've called Stu in on this --
Though I'm afraid I can't give you much time.
I've got a brief- ing with the Z-orty Committee at noon.
TONY what I have to say won't take long.
And I think we 111 all be happier if it's not on tape.
Morehouse pauses a moment then openens a drawer and switches ofd his tape machine.
MOREHOUSE Sow's your health?
MOREHOUSE I understand you got a crack on the head?

TONY expected.
I remember him very well -- from the Senate hearings on crime.
Heat little man.
Very polite, spoke in a soft, reasonable voice.
He sat there with two million dollars worth of legal talent at his elbow and told the United States Government to go piss up a rope.
You had to admire the pretentious little bastard.
TONY We're wasting each other's time with this, Mister Morehouse.
All right, Son.
This is your party.
You've got five minutes.

TONY silt it's too Late now.
TONY You've lost your chance.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
TONY If anything should happen to me -- anything at all -- you can find out.
TONY The full story will be all over the six o'clock news.
I'd like to hear your conception of the full story..
TONY You were running a no-lose operation.
TONY if we succeeded, you were rid of Vidal.
TONY -- if we failed, the Corleone family was set up to take the blame.
TONY Your hands were clean.
TONY I was the only one who could dispute your story and I wasn't supposed to come back.
TONY I've found out that my res- ignation from the Navy was processed and accepted a full week before I went down here ---
Stu?
Well, yes, Sir.
His resignation did
TONY go through, but it was a snafu -- a Yeoman's mistake, that's all.
MOREHOUSE A clerical error.
TONY And I don't buy it.
MOREBOUSE don't give a shit if you buy it or not.
MOREBOUSE And I'll tell you some- thing else, Mister Adams, or what- ever your fucking name is, I don't react favorably to blackmail.
TONY It's not blackmail.
TONY It's a simple statement of fact.
TONY If anything happens to me or if the Corleone Family is damaged iz these Senate Hearings, then the whistle blows and the whole zdmin .st_ation aces.
MOREHOUSE And what makes you think T. give a shit about what happens to the Admin- istration?
MOREHOUSE Morehouse grins without humor.
MOREHOUSE Tony's eyes flicker.
MOREHOUSE Morehouse has told something that Tony needed to know.
MOREHOUSE Morehouse is up and coming around the desk, as he continues.
Whatever I did was done under dix- ect orders from the President of the United States, and I. will.
so testify in open hearing.

The days are over when your father and his like could corrupt and intimidate this Nation.
TONY No.
TONY You've taken over the job.
Your five minutes are up -- now get the hell out of here.
As Tony turns and goes, Morehouse glares after him, the glint of victory in his eyes.
We axe outside the huge Senate Caucus room.
The double doors are open and inside we can see the preparations for the Hearing.

Well, come on now..
That's hardly the thing that would be put in writing, now is it?

And in conclusion, I'd like to say that I believe these hearings have served a great, good purpose.

Tony gets out of the car and comes up to him.
They embrace briefly and move into the house together.
As the door closes behind them, we start to move up and back.
