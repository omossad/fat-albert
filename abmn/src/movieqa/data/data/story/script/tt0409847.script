SPACE.
Infinite stars.
A TITLE:
We descend past DARK CLOUDS.
Violent FLASHES ripple within.
Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON...
Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses -- a RELIGIOUS RITE or CELEBRATION.
On the periphery, we FIND...
A BEAUTIFUL APACHE WOMAN.
Softly singing to the even more beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO -- A TEEPEE.
The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes.
But.
The wind starts to HOWL.
QRAJ.
And then...
a BURST OF LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET: FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!!
HER BABY-EXPOSED!!!!
She SCREAMS -- grabs her child and starts to RUN -- CHAOS EVERYWHERE as the tribe scatters in TERROR -- Suddenly -- Apaches are getting YANKED INTO THE AIR by some superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we WHIP AROUND the horror show of SCREAMING, DISAPPEARING INDIANS -- And now -- A DEAFENING SHRIEK AS STRANGE DOMED OBJECTS HURTLE
Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES.
BELLY VENTS snap open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE -- faster -- FASTER -- as the drills begin CHEWING INTO THE GROUND.
THE WOMAN -- staggering back in SHOCK and AWE -- clings to her baby for one final SCREAM and -- BLACK.
Over which we read: C--() ...
.-4i? 1/2 _ s A N D A
EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY burning sun FLARES LENS, beating down on...
EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY A MAN.
EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY Lying in the barren DESERT.
EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY Out cold.
EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY Handsome...
EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY but HARD.
EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes.
A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM.
The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a MONGREL DOG over him.
Mangy.
But sweet.
COUGHING, the man stumbles up.
How'd he get here?
And where the hell i.: here?
And -- OWWW.
A GASH in his side...
..
part of the wound oddly SEARED.
He winces.
Trying to solve this painful puzzle.
Something GLINTS on his wrist: A STEEL BRACELET.
No clasp to pull it off.
He touches the surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT!
And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground.
The Man grabs it to shield his eyes...
but STOFS: A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim.
A WOMAN.
Young, beautiful.
SMILING.
The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman?
is this even HIS hat?
The dog BARKS ALERT.
The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster.
NO GUNS.
THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE.
Dusty and tough.
Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over --
WES CLAIBORNE Howdy.
We're riding towards Absolution.
You know how far west we are?
The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about.
LUKE CLAIBORNE Maybe he's a dummy.
LUKE CLAIBORNE Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now --
WES CLAIBORNE There a reason you don't wanna answer my question, friend?
WES CLAIBORNE And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist --
Wes, he's got iron on his wrist...
and he's been shot.
LUKE CLAIBORNE Bet he's a chain jumper.
LUKE CLAIBORNE Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED.
If he escaped, there'll be a bounty.
Let's bring him with us.
Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back scabbard.
COCKS both barrels.
The dog GROWLS --
WES CLAIBORNE Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn round and start walking.
WES CLAIBORNE But The Man doesn't move.
WES CLAIBORNE The Claibornes share glances.
WES CLAIBORNE Wes steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE --
Dead or alive, no difference.
I said
THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST!
As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again -- SLAM!
MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel:
LUKE CLAIBORNE -- P-please, God -- d-don't -- -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK!
LUKE CLAIBORNE The rifle's EMPTY.
LUKE CLAIBORNE Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down, knocking him out cold.
LUKE CLAIBORNE And ALL of this took about ten seconds.
LUKE CLAIBORNE This man is a cold-blooded KILLER.
LUKE CLAIBORNE But somehow...
LUKE CLAIBORNE he didn't seem to KNOW that.
LUKE CLAIBORNE CONFUSION.
LUKE CLAIBORNE Drops the rifle, looks down at his hands...
LUKE CLAIBORNE covered in BLOOD.
LUKE CLAIBORNE And the BODIES in his wake.
LUKE CLAIBORNE The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket.
LUKE CLAIBORNE It DANCES on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot.
LUKE CLAIBORNE He picks it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM --
THE MAN IN BLACK Absolution...
With a HYA!
The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the third, wincing at that gash in his side.
Starts to trot off...
sees the dog following...
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) Get outta here.
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) Leave me alone.
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) But the dog keeps following.
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) Like they're FRIENDS now.
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) The man turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN
VALLEY below...
and a SPECK within it that is:
A CROOKED SIGN: "ABSOLUTION."
The town is dismal and forgotten.
Crumbling buildings blistered by sun.
The Man rides in -- dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him.
His eyes fall on the first building he sees...
A CHURCH.
BAM!
The door flies open and VOTIVE CANDLES FLICKER.
The Man looks at the dog and says --
THE MAN IN BLACK Stay.
THE MAN IN BLACK The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey -- uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound -- then A PISTOL COCKS behind him --
Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist:
MEACHAM Palms to heaven, Friend.
MEACHAM The Man freezes.
MEACHAM Turns up his hands.
THE MAN IN BLACK Been shot.
MEACHAM Only two kinds of men get shot -- criminals and victims.
MEACHAM Which one're you?
THE MAN IN BLACK don't know.
THE MAN IN BLACK Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice.
THE MAN IN BLACK Knows a lost soul when he sees one.
THE MAN IN BLACK Lowers his gun, softening...
MEACHAM Got a name, son?
THE MAN IN BLACK Don't know that either.
MEACHAM What do you know?
THE MAN IN BLACK ...
THE MAN IN BLACK English.
Off Meacham, INTRIGUED -- we CUT TO:
A CANDLE FLAME -- a NEEDLE passing through it -- it's LATER and Meacham's studying The Man's wound:
MEACHAM Odd wound.
MEACHAM Looks...
MEACHAM cauterized.
MEACHAM Means somethin' burned it half closed.
MEACHAM The Man just stares.
MEACHAM News to him.
MEACHAM And now, as Meacham leans over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to twitch...
MEACHAM lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist.
MEACHAM Meacham reacts --
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Nice trick.
MEACHAM (CONT'D) That some kinds...
MEACHAM (CONT'D) magnet?
MEACHAM (CONT'D) The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?" Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle --
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Try'n hold still.
MEACHAM (CONT'D) He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces slightly, but bears the pain.
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Where'd you ride in from?
THE MAN IN BLACK West.
THE MAN IN BLACK Woke up in the desert.
THE MAN IN BLACK Looking up at the sun like I'd been dropped outta the sky.
MEACHAM Seems I remember a story about that happening once...
MEACHAM fella by the name of Lucifer.
How 'bout I just call you "Luke," for short.
But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror: his own face unfamiliar.
Meacham nods towards The Man's HANDS --
MEACHAM (CONT'D) That blood yours or somebody else's?
THE MAN IN BLACK Three men rode up.
THE MAN IN BLACK Drew on me.
My hands...
moved on their own.
Anything else you wanna confess to while you got my attention?
And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is...
but:
THE MAN IN BLACK Everything that happened before I woke up...
THE MAN IN BLACK It's gone.
MEACHAM Well.
MEACHAM Too bad.
MEACHAM Can't absolve you for your sins if you don't recall 'em.
MEACHAM That bein' said...
MEACHAM Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling.
MEACHAM This is not a fire n' brimstone preacher.
MEACHAM This is a guy who GETS IT --
MEACHAM (CONT'D) I seen bad men do good things and good men do bad things.
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Whether you end up in heaven or hell...
MEACHAM (CONT'D) it's not God's plan...
MEACHAM (CONT'D) it's yours.
You just got to remember what it was.
The Man considers.
Darkly --
THE MAN IN BLACK What if I don't want to remember?
Then you're probl'y goin' to hell.
On cue -- SMASH!!!
The stained glass window EXPLODES as a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL hurtles into the church.
FIRE spreads around the pews -- MEACHAM ACTIVATES -- tears curtains off the confessional and uses them to STAMP OUT the fire --
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Dammit -- it's Dolarhyde's men!
MEACHAM (CONT'D) WHOOPS and HOLLERS and GUNSHOTS outside!
MEACHAM (CONT'D) The Man whirls to see A DOZEN MEN ON HORSEBACK, marauding through town --
EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS Their leader is PERCY DOLARHYDE, a cocky, hot-tempered bastard -- he ignites another Molotov, hurls it at the CLAIMS OFFICE --
HiS NAME ON IT!
The gang rides down Main Street, HOOTING -- Percy cocks another Molotov, aiming for the SALOON -- But one of his men, half-Apache NAT COLORADO, shouts:
NAT COLORADO Percy!
NAT COLORADO N2t the saloon!
PERCY Why the goddamn hell not?!
NAT COLORADO Cause your dady said so.
NAT COLORADO Something LOADED in the way he emphasizes "daddy."
NAT COLORADO Percy GLARES -- strange RESENTMENT between them.
NAT COLORADO With a growl, Percy GALLOPS
OFF, chucks the flaming bottle onto the CHURCH STEPS:
Meacham finishes putting out the fire, grabbing a couple blankets as he moves past The Man --
MEACHAM You wanna help or are you just gonna stand there and burn?!
FRIGHTENED TOWNSPEOPLE run for the sanctuary of the church, Meacham SWATS OUT the fire on the steps --
MEACHAM All right, folks -- don't panic!
MEACHAM Get inside and you'll be fine...
MEACHAM C'mon...
MEACHAM Meacham tosses The Man one of the blankets, nods across the street to the GENERAL STORE which is just STARTING to burn --
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Put it out before it gets goin'!
MEACHAM (CONT'D) ON THE MAN, not sure how he suddenly became the damn fire brigade, but HUSTLING across the street to --
WHIPS open the blanket, beats at the flames advancing toward the roof -- PUTS THE FIRE OUT as the door FLIES OPEN and out steps: A KID.
11.
Rough n' tumble.
And right now, mouth full of LICORICE.
Two FULL JARS of CANDY in his hands.
OOPS:
KID Just tryin' to save the candy.
KID You one of my Pa's hired guns?
KID Before he can answer, HOOFBEATS behind them -- and here's PERCY.
KID He yanks the reins, pulls his REVOLVER on our Man --
PERCY Who the hell're yam?
Whatever the opposite of Love At First Sight is, THIS is it:
THE MAN Nobody.
PERCY Nobody is right.
PERCY You think you can just collect your fifty dollars and ride off?
PERCY You signed up for the wrong side, boy.
The kid's scared.
The Man ISN'T, despite the gun in his face:
PERCY (CONT'D) Tell you what.
PERCY (CONT'D) You get down on your knees and kiss my boot.
PERCY (CONT'D) The Man's eyes narrow --
PERCY (CONT'D) You do that and I'll let you run back to wherever the hell you came from so you can tell whoever you see...
PERCY (CONT'D) Absolution belongs -tg..th-e- 1Dolar es.
THE MAN You want me to kiss your boot?
Percy extends his boot just INCHES from The Man's face:
PERCY Tongue's just fine if you're feelin' amorous.
PERCY Don't hold ba -- THWIP!
PERCY The Man YANKS Percy's boot off his foot in one quick move and KWHAM!!!1 WINGS IT RIGHT INTO PERCY'S FACE!
PERCY Percy FLIES off the HORSE -- The Man grabbing his rifle -- the
moment Percy lands, it's STICKING into his NECK:
THE MAN Kiss this, you sonofa --
-- Nat Colorado gallops around the corner, SHOTGUN RAISED.
PERCY Goddamnit, Nat -- SHOOT HIM!!!
PERCY -- but The Man yanks Percy up by his collar, using him as a SHIELD between himself and Colorado.
PERCY Eerily calm --
THE MAN Wherever you came from?
THE MAN Go back.
THE MAN Colorado knows he's dealing with a PROFESSIONAL.
THE MAN MORE GANG
MEMBERS ride up, surprised -- a dirty outlaw, GREAVEY, barks:
GREAVEY Sheriff's right behind us, Nat!
PERCY You goddamned shitheels!
PERCY Don't you even THINK about leavin' me!!!!
PERCY Colorado -- DECISION -- doesn't take long -- glares at The Man --
NAT COLORADO Be seeing you.
THE MAN Look forward to it.
THE MAN With that, Nat spurs his horse -- YA!
THE MAN The others follow him as he RIDES HARD out of town.
THE MAN Percy growls at The Man --
PERCY You are a dead man.
PERCY You hear me?
PERCY So help me God I will kill you my-- DM!
PERCY The Man's SMASHES Percy's skull with the gun, knocking him OUT COLD, as LAWMEN approach on horseback --
KID FA!
KID He caught Percy Dolarhyde!
KID SHERIFF KYLE TAGGART rears up on his horse.
KID Tall, dark and
handsome despite a SADNESS in his eyes, already dismounting:
SHERIFF TAGGART Emmett -- you all right?
The Kid (now EMMETT) strides towards his father excitedly:
a-f lap jack- then-stared-down-Nat-Colorado- like-he-wasn't-even-scared!!!!
Taggart turns to The Man now, cautious, but grateful --
SHERIFF TAGGART Pardon my boy, mister.
SHERIFF TAGGART He can be excitable.
SHERIFF TAGGART Kyle Taggart.
SHERIFF TAGGART The Man shakes Taggart's hand.
SHERIFF TAGGART A beat.
SHERIFF TAGGART Then --
THE MAN IN BLACK Luke.
SHERIFF TAGGART Well I'm in your debt, Luke.
SHERIFF TAGGART Tune of fifty dollars, actually.
SHERIFF TAGGART Our advert?
SHERIFF TAGGART The telegram?
SHERIFF TAGGART The Man NODS -- Oh, RIGHT.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Could use a man like you in case any of 'em come back...
THE MAN IN BLACK -- I'm just passing through.
SHERIFF TAGGART Fair enough.
SHERIFF TAGGART You don't mind spending the night, bank opens in the morning...
SHERIFF TAGGART I'll get you your money then.
SHERIFF TAGGART Saloon's got rooms.
SHERIFF TAGGART You just tell Maria I sent you.
SHERIFF TAGGART The Man tips his hat, nods to Emmett (still STARSTRUCK), turns to go.
SHERIFF TAGGART Taggart furrows his brow as the DOG scampers after him.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) You here with the prospector woman?
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) The Man stops.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Intrigued.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Turns back --
THE MAN IN BLACK woman?
SHERIFF TAGGART Yup.
SHERIFF TAGGART Real looker.
SHERIFF TAGGART Came into town yesterday with that there dog.
SHERIFF TAGGART She a friend of yours?
ON THE MAN.
His first real LEAD.
THE MAN IN BLACK Maybe.
THE MAN IN BLACK And as The Man heads off, we HOLD ON TAGGART, his spidey-sense tingling that all is not RIGHT with this...
DEPUTY WADE Somethin' wrong, Kyle?
SHERIFF TAGGART What's that French sayin' where you swear you seen someone before?
DEPUTY WADE Don't speak French.
SHERIFF TAGGART No...
SHERIFF TAGGART you sure's hell don't.
Taggart takes one last look at The Man departing as we CUT TO:
300 head of CATTLE under a blood red sky -- BOOM DOWN to THREE RANCH HANDS by a fire.
One's drinking liberally from a BOTTLE; call him ROY CLANTON.
The other two trade glances, nervous:
RANCH HAND #1 Should take it easy there, Pal --
RANCH HAND #2 Mr. Dolarhyde don't like it when we drink on the job.
ROY CLANTON I don't give a damn what he don't like -- gotta sit here and babysit a damn herd of cattle.
ROY CLANTON Dolarhyde ain't gonna do squat.
ROY CLANTON (rises; grabs his
Gotta see a man about a buffalo...
He lets out a big BURP and stumbles off behind a ridge.
More THUNDER.
Something doesn't feel right.
A sudden WHOOSH and --
JUST LIKE THE APACHES IN OUR OPENING!
Flies STRAIGHT UP, out of FRAME.
Its PLAINTIVE MOO blending into all the others:
RANCH HAND #1 You hear that?
RANCH HAND #2 Hear what?
ANOTHER COW zips up from the herd behind them.
And ANOTHER.
MANY OF THE SWSSHS.
The men slowly turn toward the sound as --
ROY CLANTON -- comes RUNNING back up the hill, pulling up his pants as the light DISAPPEARS -- to find the men GONE.
So are the COWS.
PULL BACK...
he's ALL THAT'S LEFT in the open range.
THE BATWING DOORS SWING OPEN: The Man In Black enters with the dog, tips his hat to a couple WHORES.
They GRIN, liking what they see.
RANCH HANDS drink their pay.
Behind the bar, a MAN and WOMAN argue.
DOC and MARIA; she's a buxom Mexican beauty; he's 300 roly-poly pounds of ANXIOUS CASTILIAN JEALOUSY:
DOC -- I know you are, don't lie to me!
MARIA How many times do we have to do this, Arturo?
MARIA J.
MARIA love you.
DOC Really?
DOC Do you?!?
DOC I found this in our bed!
DOC And I don't k3 Vg.
DOC a watch, Maria.
DOC I can't AfjQrd a watch because y insisted we buy this saloon!
DOC She looks at him SQUARELY -- yes, some SECRET withheld.
DOC As The
Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's EXCUSE to end this:
MARIA We have customers.
MARIA And MOVES off.
MARIA Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees EMMETT at the
back of the bar stealing sips of BEER from left-behind glasses:
Emmett RUNS OUT.
The Man sits beside an old cuss named ATTICUS.
The dog heels at The Man's feet, eyes a STEAK on Atticus' plate:
ATTICUS That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll drill him down.
MARIA Shut up, Atticus.
MARIA This is the man who took out Percy Dolarhyde.
MARIA Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster.
MARIA Maria
rolls her eyes, sets a GLASS in front of The Man, who nods:
THE MAN IN BLACK I'm looking for a woman.
THE MAN IN BLACK She gestures to the WHORES --
MARIA What kind?
THE MAN IN BLACK This kind.
THE MAN IN BLACK He removes the PHOTO from inside his hat.
THE MAN IN BLACK The one of the WOMAN.
MARIA Never seen her before.
MARIA But she is beautiful.
MARIA Here's to you finding her, Senor.
MARIA ON THE MAN.
MARIA Not exactly sure he WANTS to.
MARIA But they CLINK
glasses, knock 'em back.
Maria pours him another:
You have any idea what kind of mess you just stepped into?
THE MAN IN BLACK No.
THE MAN IN BLACK But I figured I'd be safe in here seein' as how that boy I tossed off his horse didn't wanna burn your saloon.
Maria's eyes go down.
Somehow GUILTY.
But then:
MARIA It's not the boy you should worry about.
It's his papa.
POV: UPSIDE DOWN, A MAN, surrounded by his RANCH HANDS -- his FACE just out of the light, hat brim lowered under an oil lamp:
DOLARHYDE Name's Woodrow Dolarhyde.
DOLARHYDE I'm what you might call, the Tall Hog at the trough.
His face comes INTO light: 50's, tailored finery, patent leather Wellington boots that bespeak wealth.
HARD.
Exudes POWER:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) You're Roy, right?
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Clanton, is it?
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Been working for me two weeks now, and I haven't had the pleasure.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Our POV belongs to ROY CLANTON, the ranch hand from the cow abductions.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) TERRIFIED -- his arms and legs TIED TO THE SADDLES
OF TWO HORSES, kicking dirt in front of Dolarhyde's RANCH HOUSE:
Mr. Dolarhyde, I...
I swear I didn't
-- a VIOLENT "SSST" from Dolarhyde JOSTLES the horses -- STRETCHING Roy tight enough to SNAP -- he SCREAMS --
DOLARHYDE Best not to interrupt me, Roy, makes the horses skittish.
You partial to history?
Here's a primer,
He pulls out a WHIP, gripping it by its STERLING SILVER HANDLE.
Starts CIRCLING the horses as he lets the whip UNFURL:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Following the War Of Northern Aggression -- what some ironically refer to as the "Civil" War -- came a prodigious nation- wide market for beef.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Cowtowns sprang up all along these prairies, Roy; populated by enterprising young drovers -- among 'em, my daddy, Jeremiah Dolarhyde.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Sold six of his gold teeth and a sword gifted to him by Robert E. Lee for twenty of the scrawniest Longhorns you ever saw -- then turned 'em into the fattest herd West of the Chisholm Trail.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Watched him work this lash, driving those steer til his fingers bled...
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) but what good's a whip without a herd, Roy?
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) And slowly, torturously, SWEEPS the whip tip in the dirt...
ROY CLANTON Mr. Dolarhyde, Sir, you gotta believe me -- I went to take a piss and and -- saw a light in the sky -- blue -- and when I ran back the cows and fellas were gone!
DOLARHYDE The sky.
DOLARHYDE Opened up.
DOLARHYDE And took my cows.
DOLARHYDE Incoming HOOFBEATS -- Dolarhyde looks up to see COLORADO and the rest of the GANG returning from Absolution.
DOLARHYDE A WOMAN emerges from the servant's quarters.
DOLARHYDE APACHE.
DOLARHYDE 50's.
DOLARHYDE Beautiful.
DOLARHYDE As the men REAR, Nat Colorado MEETS EYES with her.
DOLARHYDE A relationship we don't understand yet as Dolar strides up --
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Where's Percy?
NAT COLORADO Jail.
NAT COLORADO Sheriff locked him up.
Dolar darkens.
Unsheathes a KNIFE.
Looks down at Roy:
DOLARHYDE When're these people gonna lgarn?
DOLARHYDE He STABS the knife down...
DOLARHYDE SLICING the rope tethered to Roy's
FEET.
His lower body SLUMPS to the ground, he breathes a SIGH:
Dolar SLAPS the horse's rump, to which Roy's UPPER TORSO is tied; it GALLOPS off, dragging a SCREAMING ROY into the night.
DOLARHYDE Everyone saddle up.
DOLARHYDE Got us a sheriff to kill.
DOLARHYDE As he MOVES OFF, Dolarhyde's eyes go to the Apache Woman.
DOLARHYDE Something passes between them.
DOLARHYDE She seems CONCERNED.
NAT COLORADO Wasn't the sheriff, got him caught.
NAT COLORADO It was a stranger.
That STOPS Dolarhyde.
He turns back, face dark:
DOLARHYDE ...
DOLARHYDE What stranger?
NAT COLORADO Usually a man gives off a scent.
NAT COLORADO Where he's been.
NAT COLORADO What he's done.
He didn't have one.
A BULLET, in close up, twirling between the thumb and forefinger of SHERIFF TAGGART.
Boots up on his desk, TROUBLED.
Deputy Wade pours himself a cup from a TIN POT OF COFFEE:
DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE Percy wouldn't've come in shooting without his daddy's say-so, Kyle.
DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE You best get ready for a war 'cause that's what's comin'.
SHERIFF TAGGART Tomorrow we ride the little shit up Phoenix way, turn him over.
SHERIFF TAGGART Dolarhyde's got a beef, he can take it up with the 6th cavalry.
SHERIFF TAGGART Taggart's on his feet, grabs his JACKET off the door --
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Goddamn tired of this...
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) fatass rancher scaring good people off their lan-- He STOPS.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Something catches his eye on the posting board.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) YANKS a piece of paper off, a mixture of CONFUSION and CONCERN
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Sonofabitch.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) WHAT DOES HE SEE?
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Before we get a chance to KNOW --
EXT. SALOON - NIGHT EMMETT'S FACE rises into frame, peering into the saloon from below a windowsill.
EXT. SALOON - NIGHT Sees THE MAN IN BLACK at the bar as ---
-- he SLUGS back a shot, the dog at his feet, still eyeing that steak on Atticus' plate.
The Man points to his GLASS:
THE MAN IN BLACK Another.
MARIA You drink like a man who wants to forget.
THE MAN IN BLACK Other way round.
THE MAN IN BLACK The dog WHINES AGAIN for the steak.
THE MAN IN BLACK Atticus SLAMS down his silverware.
THE MAN IN BLACK Draws his GUN --
ATTICUS You got three seconds to get your dog outta here or I blow his balls off.
THE MAN IN BLACK Not my dog.
ATTICUS Q=...
ATTICUS two...
ATTICUS -- and just before "three"...
ATTICUS CA-CLICK.
ATTICUS Atticus FREEZES,
because there's a RIFLE BARREL at the back of h,iS head now:
Give you odds you don't get to 'three.' RACK TO FIND the person holding the rifle is A WOMAN.
Beautiful.
EXOTIC.
Dressed in leather.
Meet ELLA SWENSON.
ON THE MAN IN BLACK.
Can't help himself.
immediate and undeniable CHEMISTRY.
But she pays him no mind -- makes a PSST sound and the dog snaps to her side.
Atticus uncocks his gun, slowly slides it back in the holster --
ATTICUS I was just havin' some fun, Miss --
ELLA Give- him, the steak.
ELLA Atticus HESITATES, angry at the humiliation.
ELLA Ella PRESSES THE GUN HARDER against his neck, lowering him -- and his plate -- to the floor.
ELLA Right in front of the dog, who GROWLS --
ELLA (CONT'D) Now say you're sorry.
ATTICUS I'm-- sorry.
ELLA His name's 'Happy.' HappyBARES HIS TEETH.
ELLA INCHES from Atticus' face
ATTICUS I'm sorry...
ATTICUS 'Happy.'
ELLA Alright then.
ELLA You're right.
ELLA That was fun.
-- Atticus scrambles back to his feet and OUT the door, as Ella looks at the Man In Black:
ELLA (CONT'D) What're you doing with my dog?
THE MAN IN BLACK I was hoping you could tell me.
ELLA The hell're you talking ab--?
WRIST BRACELET.
Surprise and REVELATION:
ELLA (CONT'D) Where...
ELLA (CONT'D) did you get that?
ELLA (CONT'D) Before he can answer, SHERIFF TAGGART enters, along with DEPUTY WADE (carrying a SHOTGUN), and 5 other deputies.
ELLA (CONT'D) They move cautiously to THE MAN, like he's a powder keg about to go off...
SHERIFF TAGGART Hey there, "Luke."
SHERIFF TAGGART Mind following me down to the office so we can have us a chat...?
What for?
SHERIFF TAGGART All due respect, I'm the law, mister.
SHERIFF TAGGART That's what for.
The men LOCK EYES:
THE MAN IN BLACK Tell you what, Sheriff.
THE MAN IN BLACK How about you keep the fifty dollars you owe me and I just walk outta here like we.
THE MAN IN BLACK never met?
SHERIFF TAGGART Because we did meet.
SHERIFF TAGGART ON ELLA.
SHERIFF TAGGART For reasons we're not sure of, the idea of The Man leaving ALARMS her.
SHERIFF TAGGART All the Gunslingers' hands are POISED by
holsters.
The Man stays preternaturally COOL:
THE MAN IN BLACK L can't be accountable for what happens if they draw on me.
SHERIFF TAGGART And what's gonna happen?
THE MAN IN BLACK Best you don't find out.
SHERIFF TAGGART Now why'd you have to go and say that?
SHERIFF TAGGART Taggart gives a nod and the men start to CONVERGE --
THE MAN IN BLACK Don't.
THE MAN IN BLACK But Charlie makes a MOVE and The Man SLAMS his head into a pole -- the NEXT GUNMAN reaches for his pistol -- The Man PUNCHES his THROAT -- SLAMS the third into a bench -- The FOURTH straight down on the Faro table -- TAGGART levels his REPEATER -- but The Man just GRABS the barrel as Taggart FIRES a ROUND into the ceiling -- now the rifle's in
THE MAN'S HANDS and just before he PULLS THE TRIGGER on Taggart: HE SEES EMMETT AT THE WINDOW.
About to watch his father's MURDER...
and The Man LOWERS the gun:
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) I told you, I don't wanna hurt anyb-- CRACK!
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) The butt of a PISTOL WHIPS the side of his SKULL!
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) The
Man DROPS as we REVEAL who just knocked his ass OUT: ELLA!
Taggart draws a gun and pins The Man, whipping out that piece of paper he pulled from his office...
SHERIFF TAGGART Yup -- looks just like him.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) "Jake Lonergan.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Scourge a' The Territories.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Wanted Dead or Alive."
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) And The Man...
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) now forever known as JAKE...
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) stares WOOZILY into his OVERTURNED HAT...
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) the photo tucked inside of the BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN...
her image goes BLURRY...
then mil{:
1.)
A tilted, handmade trail sign: "SAGUARO PASS."
2.)
We're in a CABIN somewhere.
BLINDING ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT EXPLODES INTO THE CABIN, against which a DEMONIC SILHOUETTE appears -- it looks like an INDIAN IN FULL-FEATHER HEADDRESS --
3.)
A WOMAN'S FACE -- THE WOMAN FROM JAKE'S PHOTOGRAPH -- she looks at us and SCREAMS -- 4.)
Now we're someplace VERY DARK -- a cave?
As some kind of TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes -- 5.)
Now we're RUNNING through the cave -- ESCAPE -- BREATHING HARD -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see: 6.)
A STRANGE ROCK FORMATION on the rim of a canyon -- like a STONE TOWER pointing to heaven as the SUN WHITEWASHES US TO:
JAKE'S EYES OPEN and he GASPS AIR!
His POV: a FACE comes into FOCUS -- PERCY DOLARHYDE.
GRINNING at him from the next cell:
PERCY You're a dead.
PERCY Jake sits up.
PERCY Woozy.
PERCY Blinking back to reality.
PERCY (CONT'D) My daddy's comin' for me, Boy.
PERCY (CONT'D) You're gonna end up another dead shitheel under his spurs.
PERCY (CONT'D) I am gonna watch you suffer for a long, long -- Jake moves LIGHTNING QUICK -- reaching through the bars, GRABBING PERCY'S COLLAR, YANKING FORWARDS -- SLAMMING Percy's head into the bars, KNOCKING hIM OUT COLD AGAIN.
PERCY (CONT'D) Percy DROPS.
JAKE Shut up.
JAKE Jake sits back on his cot, rubbing his still-throbbing head.
A PRISON WAGON pulls up in front of the Sheriff's office, along with Taggart's GUNMEN on horseback.
ELLA takes frame as the men dismount and head into the office -- she pursues DEPUTY WADE with a real sense of PURPOSE:
ELLA I need to see Lonergan.
ELLA It's important.
DEPUTY WADE 'Fraid not, Miss -- we're preppin' him for transport.
DEPUTY WADE And pushes PAST her, into the office with the men.
DEPUTY WADE HOLD on Ella -- dammit, she NEEDS to find a way in there.
A KEY in the LOCK as the cell door OPENS: Sheriff Taggart, Wade, the gunmen.
GLARING at Jake, then noticing Percy --
SHERIFF TAGGART What happened to him?
Man walked into a bar.
Taggart shakes his head as Charlie and a deputy unlock Percy's cell, CUFF HIM, drag him out.
Taggart points to Jake:
SHERIFF TAGGART Step back against the wall there.
SHERIFF TAGGART Move and I shoot you dead.
JAKE You should've let me go.
SHERIFF TAGGART Yeah, I should've shot you in your knee.
SHERIFF TAGGART You put down six of my deputies.
JAKE Six was all you had.
SHERIFF TAGGART Hell, they're gonna love you in Phoenix.
JAKE Yeah?
JAKE What's in Phoenix?
SHERIFF TAGGART What you got comin', Jake Lonergan.
SHERIFF TAGGART Taggart reaches into his shirt, pulls out a pair of GLASSES.
Slips them on his nose.
Takes out that WANTED poster and reads:
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Aggravated banditry, 17 counts, Forgery, Blackmail, Hijacking, injurious use of a cattle prod, Arson, Incitement of Whorehouse Riot, and Trespassing with intent to deflower.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) You're also leader of a gang of outlaws includin' Creek Johnson and Bull McCade, which makes you accessory to every law they broke too.
JAKE That it?
SHERIFF TAGGART Saved the best for last...
SHERIFF TAGGART 'Murder.' That LANDS on Jake.
SHERIFF TAGGART Wondering if this is TRUE.
SHERIFF TAGGART Evenly --
JAKE It say who I killed?
SHERIFF TAGGART Prostitute outta Mojave, name of Alice Wills.
SHERIFF TAGGART Taggart rises, removes Jake's BLACK STETSON from a hook on the
wall, pulls that PHOTOGRAPH OF THE WOMAN from the inner brim:
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) If I were a bettin' man, I'd say this would be Ms. Wills, would it not?
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Jake just stares, CONFUSED.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) SHAKEN.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) They found her dead in a cabin round Saguaro Pass, twenty miles west of here.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) With that, a CLUE falls into place: SAGUARO PASS.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Deed was in your name.
He slips the photo back in the brim, tosses the hat to Jake:
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Dead hooker with a hole in her chest, in your cabin, plus your sterling reputation equals guilty as goddamned sin.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) And you're gonna hang for it.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) At gunpoint, Taggart PUSHES Jake out the door --
Against the RISING SUN, Dolarhyde and 15 GUNMEN ride hard, armed to the teems.
They REAR in the hills above Absolution.
Dolar looks down through BINOCULARS as NAT COLORADO turns to...
an incoming WIND.
Across the valley, a massive BLACK CLOUD is starting to SWIRL.
Violent BLUE FLASHES within.
Eerie.
GREAVEY blue light...
GREAVEY Clanton said he saw blue light before the cows disappeared...
DOLARHYDE Just a storm.
COLORADO No storm I've ever seen...
COLORADO I say we wait 'til it passes.
COLORADO But Dolar isn't listening.
COLORADO THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS: he sees PERCY being carried into the prison wagon.
COLORADO Followed by Jake.
DOLARHYDE No time, they put him in an iron coach.
DOLARHYDE With a HYA!
DOLARHYDE he's OFF, the others FOLLOWING with reluctant looks
-- still SPOOKED by that incoming STORM:
EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS As Jake's loaded into the prison wagon after the still- unconscious Percy, he SEES MEACHAM through the barred window.
The preacher flashes SYMPATHY as Wade takes out the cuff key:
DEPUTY WADE Gimme your wrist.
DEPUTY WADE Jake holds out his hands.
DEPUTY WADE Wade unlocks one wrist, freeing a cuff...
DEPUTY WADE then takes that cuff and LOCKS IT to Percy's wrist.
JAKE What're you --?
Best way to make a man stay put: chain him to his enemy.
You lovebirds have a nice trip now.
SLAM: the door CLOSES and LOCKS.
Jake SIGHS and tries to sit back, but it's hard tethered to Percy's slumped form.
Shit.
Then QWW -- something starts to STING and he looks down: HIS BRACELET.
Has started PULSING RED.
And it's getting WARM.
Jake stares -- ON EDGE -- what the hell's happening?
As -- OUTSIDE, Taggart mounts the buckboard.
EMMETT feeds the horses:
EMMETT You sure he's a bad guy, Pa?
EMMETT He did give Percy a lickin'.
SHERIFF TAGGART He's bad enough.
EMMETT can I come with you?
SHERIFF TAGGART Too dangerous.
EMMETT Dangerous to drive a damn coach?
EMMETT Why can't Charlie just take him?
SHERIFF TAGGART Because it's my job, Emmett.
SHERIFF TAGGART That's what these people pay me to do.
SHERIFF TAGGART And your mother would kill me if I brought you.
SHERIFF TAGGART Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry --
EMMETT Good thing she's already dead then.
EMMETT And turns without a goodbye.
EMMETT Taggart watches him leave, wishing
he could connect.
Takes the reins and looks up -- REACTS: THAT MASSIVE.
FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY -- roiling faster toward town.
The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE.
IN THE COACH -- WITH JAKE, looking at the BRACELET, the pulsing growing MORE FREQUENT -- and then, a VOICE:
Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window:
ELLA (CONT'D) Tell me where you got that bracelet...
JAKE Maybe you should'a asked before you knocked me out..
ELLA Please...
ELLA I need to know.
ELLA Just tell me where you got it.
JAKE Y dOli' .xBmbgX - - I don' t remember my name or where I've been or any of the things they said I done, so leave me the hell alone.
JAKE And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the dust.
JAKE Some of the gunmen ride atop it; others on horseback cover the coach in a protective ring.
Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH:
Taggart looks up: Dolarhyde's gang racing down the mountain --
He unslings his SHOTGUN as his men ready their weapons -- ON DOLARHYDE'S GANG, riding hard, guns ready too -- This is about to get UGLY.
BUT...
from the OTHER end of town, the WIND picks up -- As the massive storm cloud seems shockingly to have STORED AT A H -- its EYE churning, ROARING and...
TWO BOLTS OF BLUE LIGHTNING CRACK DOWN FROM IT!
Happy starts BARKING MADLY.
Ella sees the lightning and starts to BACK AWAY in fear:
ELLA NonoNO -- GET TO YOUR CELLARS!
ELLA EVERYONE
But her cries are LOST as -- RRRRRRRR!!!!!
The stagecoach UPENDS, FLIPPING SIDEWAYS as the animals try to break free -- Taggart and his men are THROWN -- Inside, Jake and Percy TUMBLE end-over-end -- SLAMMING into walls, LOCKED TOGETHER -- JARRING Percy back to consciousness -- Dolarhyde's men are THROWN from their horses too as the animals STAMPEDE OFF in different directions -- THE 1Q8k=O ENGULFS THE TOWN!
THE CONCUSSIVE BLAST BUCKLES
Okay, wait.
Just wait.
Take a breath.
'Cause it's about ...
to get...
MORE insane...
ROARING into the town, FLYING just above ground --
MEACHAM Jesus God!!
MEACHAM STRANGE STEEL RINGS fire from the speeders and mushroom out -- KA-CHING!
MEACHAM -- SNAP OPEN and CLAMP around necks, arms, legs -- and from these steel collars, CABLES LASH OUT, whip-snapping back to the speeders and TETHERING MAGNETICALLY to them --
Yeah-these are HIGH-TECH LASSOS:
SPEEDERS LIKE ROPED STEER!
Two of TAGGART'S GUNMEN.
Now some of DOLARYHYDE' S. Screaming, just gone.
THIS IS A...Qlp lam.
EMMETT -- stunned -- as SHERIFF TAGGART runs for him --
Emmett runs into his dad's embrace --
What's happening?!
-- Stay _by-mvside!
A_LIVERY_STABLE -- the HORSES stamp in their stalls as Taggart tears the door open and rushes Emmett inside; as he's about to follow...
am c1:t lU 01 If
-- a STEEL CABLE fires from the collar, SNAPS TAUT as it connects to a speeder and WHOOSH!
Taggart's RIPPED off his feet, dragged away -- ELLA tackles the boy as ANOTHER RING zooms overhead, locks around a FLEEING WOMAN -- she's TAKEN --
With a "C'MON!!!" she rushes him through the FRENZIED CROWD --
JAKE AND !MERCY -- TRAPPED IN THE UPSIDE-DOWN COACH -- Jake sees DEPUTY WADE on the ground just a few feet away, head bleeding --
-- but WHOOSH!
A METAL COLLAR CLAMPS AROUND WADE AND YANKS HIM AWAY!
Percy STRUGGLES wildly against Jake in a TUG-O'-WAR:
Percy RELENTS.
Offers up his hand.
Jake grabs all of Percy's
SNAPS THEM BACKWARDS!!!!!
Percy SHRIEKS as Jake KICKS him back against the wall, FORCING Percy's hand out of the cuff -- and now Jake's UNTETHERED too!
THROUGH THE CROWD -- DOLARHYDE hears his son SCREAM.
SEES the overturned coach and TWO-FINGER WHISTLES to:
DOLARHYDE Colorado!
DOLARHYDE Nat Colorado RACES IN as Dolar draws his .45 -- BANG!
DOLARHYDE --
shatters the coach lock -- they PULL Percy out:
As Dolar runs for his horse, Percy sees a PISTOL left on the ground -- grabs it with his good hand and FIRES at Jake who JUKES behind the coach for cover, Percy SHOOTING in a FURY but: -- KLINK!
A collar CLAMPS around Percy's neck and he's YANKED OFF TOO!
Dolarhyde turns and SEES HIS SON DISAPPEAR:
Meacham ushers people into the church as WALLS SHAKE, PEWS JUMP:
DOC AND MARIA burst in, huddle under a window.
Across the room, a YOUNG MAN clamps a hand over his TERRIFIED WIFE's mouth --
Doc LEAPS after her but her collar's LASSO CABLE whips out, TETHERING to a passing Speeder and she's RIPPED OUT THE DOOR --
ELLA -- hurrying Emmett toward the theater's CELLAR DOOR, but a SPEEDER circles around and ROARS toward them -- ON JAKE.
He SEES this -- and suddenly, to HIS surprise as much as OURS...
HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES!
METAL COMING TO LIFE, coiling up around his arm -- WHAT?
HOW?
-- as it becomes...
tracking that speeder as it DESCENDS on Ella and the mother and:
Ella reaches the CELLAR DOOR with Emmett.
LOCKED.
Sees a HATCHET in a stump -- rips it out and HAMMERS the lock to bits:
ELLA Everyone inside!
ELLA GO GO GO!!
ELLA Ushering Emmett and TOWNSFOLK underground, PULLS the door SHUT --
EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS JAKE stumbles up...
EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS as a speeder FIRES A RING AT HIM.
EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS But reflexively, his WRIST WEAPON FIRES ANOTHER BLAST, vaporizing it!
EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS He looks down at the blaster: "Hell y ."
EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS Another speeder circles around -- KABOOM!
EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS The blaster's incredible firepower SPIRALS THE SPEEDER OUT OF CONTROL, it
The speeder PLOWS through, parishioners flee -- the CHURCH BELL breaks from the BELL TOWER -- CRASHES DOWN ON THE SPEEDER --
As Jake keeps FIRING, the last speeders turn tail and RETREAT -- disappearing back INTO THE TORNADO as the cloud overhead OPENS UP and INHALES the swirling mass, which spirals to the heavens.
...
GONE.
The massive cloud seems to VAPORIZE and the DESERT SUN returns...
debris flutters...
smoke clears...
And all...
is...
STILL.
As our CAMERA RISES to reveal...
HALF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN
From the rubble, SURVIVORS EMERGE: EMMETT and ELLA from the cellar with inhabitants.
DOLARHYDE.
DOC.
Al in SHOCK:
DOC Maria -- oh God-- they t-took her-- What just...?
DOC MOANS, WAILS...
DOC desperate cries as people search for loved ones.
DOC JAKE'S BLASTER -- RETRACTS, folding in on itself -- shrinks down to size, reverting back into a BRACELET.
DOC He's stunned.
DOC So are
the remaining townsfolk.
DOLARHYDE is first to speak:
DOLARHYDE Who the hell're ?
NAT COLORADO He's the one who caged Percy.
NAT COLORADO Dolarhyde starts MOVING toward Jake -- wild killer eyes --
DOLARHYDE Whatwere__tho_se__thinae?
JAKE -- why're you asking m&?!
Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm -- THE BRACELET:
DOLARHYDE This!
DOLARHYDE Where'd you get this?!
DOLARHYDE It was shooting the same light beams they were --
JAKE Let go of my wrist.
DOLARHYDE -- I'm not lettin' go of nothin' til you tell me what the he-- KA-LLLANG!!
DOLARHYDE Suddenly that CHURCH BELL comes HURTLING out of the church wreckage, PLOWS through debris.
DOLARHYDE People scatter.
DOLARHYDE And out of the church stumbles...
DOLARHYDE AN ALIEN.
DOLARHYDE 8 FT.
DOLARHYDE TALL.
DOLARHYDE Standing upright, limbs inverted -- limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and
Dolarhyde can only stare, jaws dropped, and the monster LUNGES: WHUPWHUP -- something SPINNING through the air -- A HATCHET ---
ELLA, hang iust hurled it.
The alien lets out a DEATH RATTLE then FALLS FORWARD, the hatchet embedding deeper as it HITS THE DIRT.
Holy SHIT.
Ella's adrenaline dynamo starts to die down, replaced now by SHOCK.
And for what seems like the first time, FEAR.
She EXHALES a crazy breath, stumbles back...
as slowly...
people converge around the corpse:
EMMETT Is it...
EMMETT dead?
EMMETT Jake KICKS the alien.
EMMETT It doesn't move.
EMMETT Happy BARKS --
DOLARHYDE The hell j,,a it?
MEACHAM A demon.
MEACHAM They all turn to see MEACHAM.
MEACHAM TERRIFIED.
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Revelations 16:14: "For there are spirits of demons, showing signs."
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Escaped from hell itself.
EMMETT Lookit its wrist!
EMMETT It's got one'a those bracelet things too!
EMMETT Indeed, there on the creature's wrist is an IDENTICAL BRACELET.
EMMETT ON JAKE.
EMMETT Mind tumbling.
EMMETT He meets eyes with ELLA.
EMMETT Her face as EAGER as his to understand this and now...
EMMETT BEEP.
EMMETT BEEP.
EMMETT BEEP.
EMMETT What's that SOUND?
EMMETT Everyone looks at each other.
EMMETT Colorado bends closer to the corpse...
EMMETT SCARED...
NAT COLORADO I think...
NAT COLORADO it's comin' from somewhere inside it.
NAT COLORADO People look at each other: WHAT NOW?
NAT COLORADO Trying to control the near- hysteria they all feel.
NAT COLORADO Finally, Dolarhyde takes a BREATH --
more BRAVADO than actual courage:
DOLARHYDE Only one way to find out.
DOLARHYDE We need to cut it open.
You're a doctor.
Got a bone saw?
DOC snaps out of his stupor, looks up, FREAKED --
DOC Are you...
DOC serious?
DOLARHYDE Wake u Those things took your wife --
DOLARHYDE Well this one here's our only chance of findin' where they went.
DOLARHYDE That LANDS on all of them.
DOLARHYDE A long beat.
DOLARHYDE Doc looks down at the thing, ORANGE GOO dribbling around the AXE in its head...
So you got a bone saw or don't you?
THUD!
The alien corpse is DROPPED onto the bar by Doc and Meacham.
As Dolarhyde and Colorado follow through the batwings -- Doc WHIPS a SHOTGUN from under the bar:
DOC Stay outside.
DOC You're not welcome in here!
DOC Dolar brings up his COLT -- so does COLORADO --
DOLARRYDE I own more of this town than any man in it so I'll go wherever the hell I damn please.
DOLARRYDE And for the record?
DOLARRYDE You ain't welcome in my country, Mexican.
DOLARRYDE Ella steps between them, BAD ASS --
ELLA Whatever troubles you had don't mean a damn thing against the ones we got now.
ELLA We wanna see our way through 'em, your guns better start pointing in the same direction, Goddammit.
ELLA Doc and Dolar never take eyes off each other.
ELLA or their GUNS.
ELLA Finally...
ELLA Dolar LOWERS his.
ELLA So does Doc.
ELLA People BREATHE.
ELLA Meacham slips on a pair of GLASSES, studying eerie veins and muscles through the creature's viscous outer layers.
ELLA Doc turns his focus to the alien too.
ELLA Picks up his PUMP-OPERATED BONE SAW.
ELLA Presses his boot on the bellows, it turns with a WHIR...
ELLA SHAKING as he brings the SPINNING BLADE to the alien's CHEST.
ELLA Looks at Meacham, AFRAID --
DOC If it 'mss a demon, and I cut it open...
DOC am I going to burn for it?
Meacham hesitates a beat, then CROSSES the air in front of Doc --
MEACHAM That should cover ya.
MEACHAM ON DOC.
MEACHAM Little relief.
MEACHAM BROW SWEATING, he brings the spinning blade down toward the disgusting ALIEN -- VRRRRZZ -- HESITATES --
DOC Excuse me.
DOC B GH!
DOC He PUKES on the ground.
EMMETT Jesus, Doc!!!
EMMETT Doc wipes his mouth with a handkerchief, slightly DEFIANT --
DOC This is not normal.
DOC I'm entitled to vomit.
DOC We should XU be vomiting.
DOLARHYDE Just cut, Lardass.
DOLARHYDE Doc GLARES...
DOLARHYDE with a still-shakitig hand, gets back to business --
and...
SHUNK!
Doc looks up at Jake, gestures to the carcass:
DOC Senor?
DOC A hand?
You too, maricon.
The men all grip the chest plate and PULL -- A DISGUSTING CRACK.
Everyone turns away, scowling, Emmett wafting the air:
EMMETT Damn!
EMMETT Smells like a dead dog's ass.
MEACHAM Emmett.
EMMETT Sorry, Father.
EMMETT Doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores...
DOC Chet wall's partially collapsed...
DOC no familiar organs of any kind...
DOLARHYDE 'course they're not familiar.
DOLARHYDE Just look at this th--
SUDDENLY THE ALIEN'S ARM LASHES OUT -- claws SNAP OPEN and PIN Dolarhyde against the wall!
Everyone tries to PRY the claws from his neck -- but the second Doc withdraws his hands from the alien's chest, its arm goes LIMP.
Dolarhyde drops, GASPING...
DOC Spinal reflex.
DOC And GRINS at Dolar's pain.
DOC But Meacham NOTICES something around
Dolar's neck where the alien pinned him, like a ring of DUST:
MEACHAM Something on your neck.
MEACHAM Hold still.
MEACHAM Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb
and forefinger.
The dust GLINTS under the kerosene lamp:
MEACHAM (CONT'D) I'll be damned...
MEACHAM (CONT'D) gold.
MEACHAM (CONT'D) They check the creature's hand talons: GOLD FLAKES underneath
'em, and Lots of it.
Colorado checks its taloned feet:
NAT COLORADO Down here too.
NAT COLORADO This much ore...
NAT COLORADO could only have come from a digging in a mine.
NAT COLORADO That LANDS on everyone.
NAT COLORADO but most especially ELLA.
NAT COLORADO Who looks up to see Jake READING her in this moment.
EMMETT In the ALIEN'S EYE is a SMALL FLASHING LIGHT.
EMMETT On/Off/On/Off in time with that BEEP BEEP BEEP.
DOC Gimme my scalpel.
DOC In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he pulls it from its socket, attached to a STRINGY OPTIC NERVE
dripping with juice.
Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB: -- he takes hold of the blinking orb.
It FLARES to life, the light coalescing into a 3-D ARROW-LIKE HOLOGRAM.
Confusion.
Doc REMOVES it from the optic nerve and the hologram DISAPPEARS:
DOLARHYDE Where'd it go?
DOLARHYDE The hell'd you do?
DOC Nothing, just pulled it off --
He reconnects it to the optic nerve, the hologram REAPPEARS:
Only works when it's touching the creature.
Colorado moves closer...
rainbow light flickering across his face...
I think...
it's a compass.
Look:
No matter how you move it, it points in the same direction.
EMMETT Compasses point north.
EMMETT That's west.
MEACHAM West's where 141 came from.
MEACHAM ON JAKE.
MEACHAM Another puzzle piece falling into place.
EMMETT If you're right, what's it pointing to?
ELLA The rest of 'em.
Be my guess.
DOLARHYDE Then that's where I'm goin'.
He SNAPS his PISTOL open, loading bullets:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) One of my ranchers said my herd disappeared into the sky.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) 'Til about ten minutes ago, I figured him for a liar.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Nobody takes my cattle.
MEACHAM Your b was taken too.
MEACHAM A FLASH of something from Dolarhyde -- could that be EMOTION?
But just as fast, it's GONE.
Almost a THROWAWAY:
DOLARHYDE I noticed.
NAT COLORADO What if they're already dead?
EMMETT They're not dead.
ELLA Kid's right.
ELLA If all they wanted was to kill us, they would've.
DOLARHYDE Looked to me like...
DOLARHYDE they were ropin' people.
Means they need 'em for something.
Whatever it is, we can either stand here guessin'...
or go find out.
His eyes flash to Nat: "C'mon."
And they EXIT.
Everyone looks at each other, working up the courage to face what they know they must.
Doc grabs his SHOTGUN, starts gathering shells:
DOC If she's alive -- if there's even a
MEACHAM Lord hates a coward...
MEACHAM but our bullets were useless against those things.
MEACHAM Other than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and outnumbered.
MEACHAM As one by one, they turn...
MEACHAM to JAKE.
MEACHAM Who until this point has been mostly SILENT.
MEACHAM Observing.
MEACHAM But now -- he's gone from enemy to potential savior in a heartbeat.
JAKE Whoa, I got nothing to do with this --
ELLA You got everything to do with it.
ELLA If you can remember where you got that thing --
JAKE I remember you all wantin' me on the end of a damned rope.
JAKE Whatever's happenin' here's got nothin' to do with me.
ELLA You sure.
ELLA about that?
ELLA He LOOKS at her.
ELLA No, he isn't.
ELLA But he sure as hell won't stay to debate it -- turns to go --
EMMETT Mr. Lonergan?
EMMETT Sir?
EMMETT The EMOTION in the boy's voice STOPS Jake at the door.
EMMETT (CONT'D) My mother died last year.
EMMETT (CONT'D) My Paw...
EMMETT (CONT'D) he's all I got.
And despite a fleeting moment of SYMPATHY, Jake darkens --
JAKE Kid, I'm the last man you want anywhere near you, your Pa...
JAKE or anyone else in this goddamned town.
OUT the door.
Everyone trades looks, then Ella FOLLOWS:
Jake moves FAST past blown-out STOREFRONTS as Ella PURSUES:
ELLA That's it?
ELLA You're just gonna run away?
JAKE No, Sister.
JAKE I'm walking away.
ELLA Well s w.
ELLA As he keeps on walking, Ella picks up a ROCK, wings it at the back of his HEAD -- WHAMI Jake stumbles forward, TURNS AROUND --
SONOVA-- -- I told you to gyp.
Ella strides forward, picking up another rock on the move --
JAKE What's your damn problem?!
ELLA You're comin' with us.
JAKE I'm not coming anywhere.
JAKE And you throw that rock I swear I'll-- WHAM!
JAKE The rock glances off his shoulder --
ELLA If you're walkin' away from here, what the hell're you walking tsQ?
ELLA That PENETRATES as Jake realizes he doesn't really KNOW.
ELLA And that's the last thing he's gonna admit --
JAKE What the hell are you walkin' to, Lady?
JAKE 'Cause if I heard right, it sounds like suicide to me.
-- now it's her turn to pause.
Cryptically:
ELLA I...
ELLA just wanna help these people.
JAKE Bullshit.
JAKE You wanna help yourself.
JAKE Saw your face light up the minute you knew that thing might lead you to gold.
JAKE And the fact that he's BUSTED her gets Ella's hackles up --
ELLA It's not gold I want, you dumb sonofabitch, it's what it'll buy me.
JAKE And what's that?
ELLA Remange.
ELLA Whatever that means, it's a deep, painful LONGING in her.
ELLA She
stares at him, DEAD ON:
ELLA (CONT'D) And lookin' at you?
ELLA (CONT'D) I'd bet a silver dollar...
ELLA (CONT'D) its what you want, too.
ELLA (CONT'D) With that, Ella turns and STRIDES OFF as we HOLD ON JAKE, face knotted in conflict.
ELLA (CONT'D) As her words RESONATE.
Was the Devil come to Absolution...
come to drag our town down to hell...
SERIES OF SHOTS - AS DUSK TAI .t $.
TQ .NIGItT: Though BURNING EMBERS, Emmett helps a LITTLE GIRL pull her half- burnt DOLL from the rubble...
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) but our town's not just a buncha buildings, Brothers and Sisters -- Nossir.
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) Our town is fie.
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) Good, God- fearing souls.
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) Pure and hopeful.
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) And the devil can't never take that away...
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) Ella and Doc tend to WOUNDED PEOPLE in a triage area as...
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) Meacham finds his overturned PULPIT.
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) Determination in his eyes,
he pushes it UPRIGHT:
He's standing on the pulpit in the rubble, his words a sermon/call-to-arms -- every survivor GATHERED AROUND:
MEACHAM (CONT'D) In times of darkness, God asks that we come together so we may stand and fight.
MEACHAM (CONT'D) So we're goin' after our kin.
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Any of you aren't able or prepared, no shame in it.
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Head up to Fort Huachuca, join up with the garrison there and pray...
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Rest of us ride out at sun-up to recover that which we have lost.
MEACHAM (CONT'D) SUNRISE: Pistol chambers SPINNNN -- rifles are COCKED --
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) Thy will be done, Lord, and there's an amen behind it.
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) Lo and behold, most of the town survivors are just too damn scared.
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) They form an EXODUS LINE, heading off toward the fort.
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) Dolarhyde, Colorado and his REMAINING MEN (6) load the ALIEN CORPSE onto the back of a WAGON.
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D) Some of them trade glances --
DAMN WORRIED about staying.
Dolarhyde sees it:
DOLARHYDE Somebody got something to say?
DOLARHYDE His withering GLARE keeps them from speaking up.
DOLARHYDE Doc and
Meacham climb onto the wagon:
Sure we need to bring that thing along?
Doc nods as he TWISTS the forceps in the Alien's eye, the COMPASS HOLOGRAM flickering to life before them:
DOC If this arrow points me back to Maria?
DOC Yeah -- J'm sure.
DOC Emmett appears leading a PONY, a BOW and quiver of ARROWS slung
around his back:
MEACHAM Can't come, Emmett, too dangerous.
EMMETT I can protect myself -- shoot, I'm the only master bowman in my archery club.
EMMETT Won the county tournament by shootin' a flipped nickel at 50 paces.
MEACHAM Somethin' tells me these things don't carry nickels, son.
MEACHAM Answers's no.
EMMETT You want me to ride off with the chickenshits, then double back, be happy to.
EMMETT But let's just skip that part and get to it, Padre.
And that's the truth.
Meacham sighs, no choice...
finally:
MEACHAM Go fill your canteen, dammit.
MEACHAM He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off.
MEACHAM Emmett GRINS and mounts the pony, then sees...
MEACHAM JAKE riding past.
MEACHAM ANGRY EYES from
Ella as she heels her horse and TROTS OFF angrily:
ELLA C'mon, Happy.
ELLA But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME?
JAKE Oh shut up.
JAKE Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde
VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off:
DOLARHYDE I was ridin' into town to kill you for what you done to my son.
DOLARHYDE You owe me your life, Boy.
Ride with us, we'll call it square.
His hand rests on his nickel-plated .38.
Eyes gleaming cruelly.
JAKE You that fast?
-- WHOOSH: Jake's hand is already UP with his own PISTOL, having drawn before Dolarhyde can finish his sentence:
JAKE Now you owe me y.Q= life.
JAKE We're square.
JAKE In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster.
JAKE Point made, he RIDES ON.
JAKE Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out-
drawn, turns to CULOBAI)U -- speaks LOW:
DOLARHYDE Follow him.
DOLARHYDE Soon as he's got his back turned...
DOLARHYDE kill him.
Shit.
Colorado hesitates.
Dolar GLARES: "Do it."
Finally Colorado NODS acquiescence, moves off...
JAKE -- on the OUTSKIRTS of town now -- riding past Meacham and Doc on the WAGON:
MEACHAM Figure out which way you're headed yet?
JAKE West.
JAKE Saguaro Pass.
MEACHAM That's not what I meant.
MEACHAM The inference LANDS on Jake.
MEACHAM But he's in no mood.
MEACHAM GALLOPS off.
Meacham watches Jake go...
MUSIC RISES AS WE DISSOLVE THROUGH:
A man running from his demons, or maybe toward them...
through plains and pasturage...
until he sees the tilted ROAD SIGN: "SAGUARO PASS."
Up ahead, he sees DEBRIS...
Part of a ROOF, lying broken on the ground.
Pieces of a STONE CHIMNEY.
Jake comes over a rise...
to REVEAL:
EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY A DESTROYED LOG CABIN.
EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY Walls partially TORN AWAY.
EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY Something in Jake is DEEPLY STIRRED.
EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY Dismounts, tentatively...
EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY walks up to
the PORCH.
Boots CRUNCH over broken window glass as they ENTER:
LIGHT BEAMS stream in.
Eerie quiet.
Jake takes it in, HAUNTED.
Something CRUNCHES under his boot -- DRIED FLOWERS.
Sticking out from an OVERTURNED CRACKED VASE.
Jake BLINKS, affected -- Bends over, TOUCHES the VASE AS: MEMORY FLASECUT!
FRESH FLOWERS in a woman's hand...
THE W B& FROM JAKE'S PICTURE.
She smiles at him --
THE WOMAN You shouldn't have.
THE WOMAN She turns, drops the flowers into the vase as we see she's talking to JAKE.
JAKE Got you somethin' else.
CLINK -- He drops a LEATHER POUCH on the table next to the vase.
A FEW GOLD COINS clink out.
The woman turns to him, WORRIED:
THE WOMAN Where'd you get this?
JAKE Where do you think?
JAKE The woman looks to the pouch -- Picks up one of the coins.
JAKE TORN.
JAKE Jake moves behind her.
JAKE Close.
JAKE An INTIMACY here.
THE WOMAN Your boys '11 come after you.
ON JAKE.
Dark.
But DETERMINED:
JAKE Let 'em come.
JAKE She turns to him, their eyes HOLD...
JAKE and they KISS.
JAKE Soft.
JAKE Tender.
JAKE Soulful.
But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window: A STORM CLOUD on the horizon.
Same kind that consumed the town.
The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork.
The pouch slides off the table...
THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and --
BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE REELING.
BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE What is this memory?
BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE Who the hell is the woman?
Something GLINTS in the far wall where the chimney used to be:
EMBEDDED in the wood.
Jake pulls it out of the wall, a thousand questions in his eyes.
Sunlight SHIMMERS off it and -- MEMORY FLASHCUT!
The spilled coins start SLIDING across the floor all by themselves, as if magnetically drawn to THE CHIMNEY -- WHOOSH!
-- SUCKED right up into it by some VACUUM FORCE!
THE WOMAN What's happening?!!!
FORCE AS ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT CRASHES IN!
The Woman SCREAMS and --
She manages to GRAB a doorknob and DANGLES UPWARD, CHOKING as --
A DEMONIC SILHOUETTE drops in front of them!
JESUS!!
Jake draws his pistol and FIRES!
The demon SHRIEKS IN RAGE as SPIKED PLUMES fan out from its huge, elongated skull...
making it look like a SILHOUETTED It QIAi? 1/2 1.-L 2 A T EI!
R HEADDRESS!
Its HIDEOUS FACE comes into the light -- AN AIJIE -- as it raises its arm, wearing a WRIST BRACELET that reshapes into a
JAKE DIVES AWAY but a searing pulse RIPS A WICKED GASH in his side (now we know how he woke up with it in the desert) --
C-Mr-M.
She 's HURLED backward into the wall, Jake.
CRIES OUT:
JAKE Alice!
JAKE As he RUSHES to her, her collar UNLOCKS...
JAKE and FLIES AT JAKE, clamping HE'S PULLED INTO THE LIGHT, CHOKING, SCREAMING --
BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE As he STUMBLES back -- GASPING -- touching his neck -- Catches his breath.
BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE ROCKED.
BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE Sees "Alice's" BLOOD STAIN on the wall.
BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE His shaking hand reaches out, brushes over it...
JAKE (CONT'D) "Alice"...
JAKE (CONT'D) Whoever she was to him, he feels sledgehammered with GRIEF.
JAKE (CONT'D) All he knows is, it was THEM.
JAKE (CONT'D) The creatures killed her.
JAKE (CONT'D) And this revelation...
JAKE (CONT'D) well, it galvanizes him with RAGE.
JAKE (CONT'D) Rage that gives him NEW PURPOSE...
JAKE (CONT'D) then--
The stone HITS Colorado as he FIRES, the bullet tears PAST Jake -- as Colorado recovers, Jake BODYSLAMS HIM -- the GUN goes flying, they go hurling THROUGH THE WALL -- LANDING HARD on the other side -- aaballs-out.
messy.
close-quarter death match -- Jake takes a PUNCH -- Colorado LOOPS an arm around his throat, YANKS -- they TUMBLE/SLAM to the floor, Jake LANDING on top of Colorado who holds the arm lock, CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --
Jake -- EYES POPPING -- SEES THE GUN just out of reach -- fingers GRASP for it -- seconds before he PASSES OUT He GRABS the gun and swings it back -- BLAMMII!Colorado ROLLS aside as the WALL where his head just was BLOWSOPEN--and Jake's ON HIM, PISTOL WHIPPING HIM MERCILESSLYuntilheSPINS the gun back around and POINTS IT between Colorado's eyes: ON JAKE -- quaking with rage -- he wants to kill this guy so bad he can taste it...
but something's HOLDING HIM BACK -- GRITS his teeth, COCKS the trigger and:
EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY -- we CUT WIDE on the cabin as a GUNSHOT CRACKS.
EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY A flock of BIRDS screech into the sky from the overgrown corn field...
The rest of our people RIDE along, following the ever-tilting HOLOGRAPHIC ARROW, their COMPASS, floating from the dead alien's eye in the back of the wagon.
Greavey, Dolar's ranch hand, heels up to ELLA.
COCKY SWAGGER:
GREAVEY So...
GREAVEY what's a pretty lady like y--
ELLA -- you finish that sentence, I shoot you in your beef whistle.
ELLA Doc, sipping from his canteen, does a SPIT TAKE.
ELLA Ella's eyes
DRILL Greavey.
Cut down a peg, he tips his hat, red-faced:
GREAVEY Ma'am.
And rides past her, taking us to EMMETT and DOLARHYDE:
DOLARHYDE Tell me somethin', Kid...
DOLARHYDE why didn't your father just take my money?
What money?
offered him a thousand dollars to leave town.
He could's taken you outta harm's way, relocated...
found you a new momma.
And this just BURNS Emmett.
A beat; then:
EMMETT Is it true Percy's momma died givin' birth to him, Mister Dolarhyde?
Something FLASHES in Dolarhyde.
But he's contained:
DOLARHYDE Yeah.
EMMETT Then maybe you should use that thousand dollars to buy yourself a new wife.
EMMETT Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's.
EMMETT Brave and UNFLINCHING.
EMMETT Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie...
EMMETT but
it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls:
DOC Madre Dios...
DOC And we PAN AROUND, dropping over his shoulder to see what he's reacting to -- AN ENORMOUS CRATER.
DOC ACRES WIDE...
DOC TWENTY FEET DEEP.
DOC Even
Dolarhyde looks nervous now:
What the...
hell is it?
MEACHAM It was Winfield's Landing.
They turn to see Meacham, brushing the DUST off a WOODEN SIGN: Holds it UP.
" Winfield's Landing...
Population 133."
ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN.
Shit.
He doesn't mean...?
GREAVEY You tryin' to tell me those...
GREAVEY things pulled the whole damn town into the sky?
GREAVEY And suddenly a weird CRACK shakes the canyon -- like the SOUND
BARRIER BREAKING -- everyone's look goes UP where: SWIRLING, DARK CLOUDS LOOM.
The same clouds that dropped the tornado on Absolution.
And that appeared in Jake's MEMORIES at the cabin.
But this time, something's SHOT OUT from them --
MEACHAM That can't be good.
MEACHAM The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND
DOLARHYDE Scatter.
-- everyone runs their horses aside as the object BOUNCES over rocks -- then SLOWS...
to a STOP.
They STARE.
Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly...
DISMOUNTS, draws his GUN.
What he sees is SHOCKING: It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of TRANSLUCENT COCOON.
Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a GE, DEC SHAPE.
Motionless.
UH-OH.
The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK and FEAR.
But the thing doesn't MOVE.
DOC Should we...
DOC open it?
DOLARHYDE Should we open it?
DOLARHYDE Hell NO we shouldn--
EMMETT -- oops -- -- and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a Small TEAR in the cocoon's outer embryonic layer -- GOO leaks -- then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out.
EMMETT BEAT.
EMMETT Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come
FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground:
Motionless.
DEAD, in fact.
A METAL TUBE jammed in its mouth, connected to a VALVE in the now-flaccid bubble's outer shell.
Greavey notices a BRANDING on the cow's rump -- the letter "D":
GREAVEY Boss...
GREAVEY it's one'a yours.
Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW.
Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED:
EMMETT Is-- is this what happened to my Pa?
EMMETT Doc dismounts.
EMMETT Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE
with a wet SQUISHING sound.
Thinking it through:
DOC This was stuck down its throat...
DOC to help it breathe.
DOC That means they wanted to keep it alive, Emmett.
DOC I'm sure your father is fine.
But Doc's eyes aren't sure.
Meacham looks back to the sky:
MEACHAM Why'd they dump it?
ELLA Whatever they needed from it, they must've got.
Gonna get dark soon, need to keep moving.
She does.
The others FOLLOW in a chilled daze.
The last is DOLARHYDE, glancing back at his dead cow with angry eyes...
Now our people APPEAR riding up a ridge...
Dolarhyde shoots up a HAND, bringing the caravan to a STOP.
Once again, SHOCK:
EMMETT Ho-ly shit.
BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below: AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT.
Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the desert.
Just like that cow.
Off their LOOKS --
TRACKING alongside of the TILTED PADDLEBOAT, our team rides around it.
Trying to make SENSE.
STENCILED on the stern is...
DOC "Colorado Queen."
The river's two hundred miles from here.
But Ella doesn't seem as impressed as the rest of them.
In fact, her attention is drawn BEHIND them, to something coming up over the DUNES...
the barest flicker of a smile --
ELLA Son of a bitch.
ELLA IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK.
ELLA Followed by another horse, with COLORADO in the saddle.
ELLA Wrists tied but ALIVE.
ELLA As Jake rides to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse -- the indian HITS
the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES:
JAKE Your man got it in his head that he was s'posed to kill me.
JAKE I'm holding onto his ear 'til he says sorry.
As Colorado stumbles to his feet angrily, humiliated, Dolar notices his BLOODY EAR.
The LOBE has been SHOT OFF.
He looks up at Jake, half-angry, half-EMBARRASSED --
DOLARHYDE Why'd you let him live?
DOLARHYDE Jake's hard-as-nails.
DOLARHYDE DRIVEN now --
JAKE Gonna need him.
He rides past Dolar to Ella.
Stops.
Says, simply:
JAKE (CONT'D) Nice boat.
JAKE (CONT'D) What's that smell?
ELLA That'd be me.
ELLA He realizes her shirt's caked in the BLUE GOO from the cow.
JAKE Why're you blue?
Cause I missed ya.
Their look HOLDS.
A MOMENT.
Something REAL between them.
DOLARHYDE We better keep movin'.
DOLARHYDE A THUNDERCRACK.
DOLARHYDE On the horizon, sheets of RAIN.
JAKE Storm's comin'.
JAKE I say we dig in here til it passes.
JAKE (to Colorado; fucking
How's that sound, Nat?
Nat BURNS.
Dolar feels his AUTHORITY being undermined:
DOLARHYDE Storm or no storm, I say we keep movin'.
Colorado finally turns to Uolarhyde.
DEFIANT:
NAT COLORADO Too hard tracking anything in the rain.
Dolarhyde GLARES at Colorado, who GLARES BACK: his loyalty now in QUESTION.
The tide IS turning against the rancher.
RAIN POURS on the overturned boat.
Horses tethered.
The ALIEN CORPSE has been moved onto a slanted deck, covered by a TARP...
WE TILT TO THE ALIEN'S HAND.
Poking out.
Motionless.
HOLD on it, longer than we're comfortable.
A RATTLESNAKE is coiled around a CHANDELIER...
except the chandelier is on the floor and the floor is the CEILING.
Upended gambling tables.
WOODRATS scurry over FOOD.
Every window's SMASHED...
as if something just TOOK everyone.
Dolar sits by a FIRE made from furniture parts, drinking from a WHISKEY FLASK.
Colorado opposite, rubbing his MANGLED EAR.
DOLARHYDE You okay?
COLORADO Yeah.
COLORADO Dolar pours some whiskey on a BANDANA, leans towards Colorado --
Lemme clean it for you or it'll get -- -- I'm fine.
Dolarhyde backs away.
Colorado GLARES.
DOLARHYDE Say it.
COLORADO Is Percy worth dyin' for?
COLORADO Dolar's eyes flash.
COLORADO A mixture of anger and PAIN.
COLORADO Then --
DOLARHYDE He's my son.
I take care of my kin, Nat.
ON COLORADO as that lands.
Clearly, there's something here...
a bond that seems to go deeper than just boss and employee.
But WHAT?
Finally Nat just gets up and LEAVES.
Dolar watches him go, takes a healthy SWIG.
Hears a WHIMPER.
Looks over and sees...
EMMETT, huddled in a corner.
CRYING.
ON DOLARHYDE.
The kid's naked emotion AFFECTING him, but the fact Dolar might have a conscience makes him ANGRY too.
Low:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Hey.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Kid.
Emmett looks up, SNIFFLES.
Dolar tosses him the WHISKEY FLASK:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Take a drink and shut p.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) He gets up, walks off.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Leaving the kid with the flask.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) As Emmett looks at it confusedly, stuffs it in his POCKET --
Meacham has set out TIN PANS under holes to collect RAIN WATER.
Dumps a pan into his CANTEEN as Doc enters with COFFEE for him:
DOC We brought enough water.
MEACHAM Not for drinkin', it's for blessin'.
Doc nods: ah.
Turns to go...
STOPS.
Turns back.
Intense eyes:
DOC Padre...
DOC Maria came to see you in confession every Sunday.
DOC It seemed...
DOC she had a lot to talk about.
DOC Was she having an affair?
DOC Meacham removes his spectacles.
DOC Looks at Doc --
MEACHAM You know I can't say.
MEACHAM And Doc DOES know.
MEACHAM But there's a quiet DESPERATION here --
DOC The last thing I said to her...
DOC I...
DOC Please.
DOC If I'm wrong about my wife...
DOC I don't want to die angry.
DOC Meacham sees the PAIN in his friend's eyes.
MEACHAM You can ask Maria if she was cheatin' on you once we get her back.
MEACHAM 'Til then?
MEACHAM Don't die.
And OFF DOC, thunder CRACKS --
RAIN pours down through an open gash in the roof, splashing the floor.
Ella enters, glances back toward the door to make sure she's alone, then pulls off her shirt and folds it over a stool.
Upper body NAKED in the moonlight.
We catch only a FLASH of this, and for a moment it's PURE HOTNESS...
until she turns and something ELSE is revealed: criss- crossed LASH MARKS on her back.
She turns away and starts to SPLASH herself with water, erasing the blue goo and dirt from her skin and face...
then: A MATCH ignites behind her.
She WHIRLS, startled, covering her breasts with her arms -- JAKE is sitting in a chair at the Commodore's desk, casually lighting a cheroot in his mouth:
JAKE You missed a spot.
ELLA The hell,-re- you doing here?
JAKE Mindin' my own business.
JAKE Then you decided to take a shower.
ELLA Why didn't you say anything?
JAKE Givin' you privacy.
JAKE She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored.
JAKE Jake tosses her his jacket.
JAKE As she slips it on, she notices a bottle of WHISKEY on the table...
JAKE and the PHOTOGRAPH OF ALICE.
ELLA she's pretty.
ELLA Who was she?
Jake's quiet.
DARK.
Intense emotion, intensely suppressed:
JAKE only thing I know's her name was Alice...
And she's dead.
Ella looks up at him.
INTO him --
ELLA Maybe you loved her.
Jake shakes his head, sort of mumble/chuckles in RESISTANCE:
JAKE All you women are the same -- Always wanna make it about Goddamn "love."
Trust me, Lonergan.
I'm not the same.
There is a force -- a strength about this woman -- that he connects with.
But remains, true to character, ALOOF:
JAKE Don't matter.
JAKE She takes a step closer.
JAKE Soft.
JAKE Intimate.
ELLA So what dj= matter?
ELLA Jake just looks at her.
ELLA Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips, the FLARE of its tip casting him in a demonic light...
JAKE What matters is I find the thing that killed her.
JAKE And make it pay.
JAKE And now, he leans forward with a focused LOOK...
JAKE holds up his
JAKE (CONT'D) Where'd you see this before?
JAKE (CONT'D) A beat.
JAKE (CONT'D) Ella -- somehow CONTAINED -- opens her mouth to lie.
JAKE (CONT'D) But he cuts her off --
JAKE (CONT'D) -- and don't lie to me.
JAKE (CONT'D) You wouldn't've asked me if you didn't recognize it.
Ella tightens.
PAIN in her eyes.
And Jake REALIZES:
JAKE (CONT'D) Those things...
JAKE (CONT'D) they the ones who put those marks on your back?
JAKE (CONT'D) She swallows: a mixture of SHAME that he's found her out...
JAKE (CONT'D) and ANGER at what was done to her.
ELLA They took my people.
ELLA Destroyed where I'm from.
JAKE Where's that?
ELLA North of here.
ELLA Been trackin' 'em ever since, town to town.
ELLA Best I figure, they're hidin' in a mine.
Jake CONSIDERS all this.
Softens a little:
JAKE Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead of throwin' rocks at me --
ELLA -- what, you would've stuck around?
ELLA Bullshit.
ELLA I couldn't've turned you away from what you had to do, any more than I could've stopped these people from going after their kin.
Truth ain't worth a damn, Jake...
and we're gonna need all the guns we can get.
Their look HOLDS...
until Jake SMIRKS.
Likes her style:
JAKE So that's the only reason you wanted me to come with you?
JAKE Cause of my gun?
There's a pause...
then Ella SMIRKS back:
ELLA No, not your gun.
What you do with it.
Among the many things these two ate feeling -- both separately and together -- the one that pops right now is ATTRACTION.
Confusing as it is for him.
The pregnant moment LINGERS...
Until Happy suddenly starts to GROWWWWL, sensing something outside.
ANOTHER CRACK OF THUNDER as:
The horses STAMP NERVOUSLY out the window as Greavey and the rest of Dolarhyde's men (COBBETT and 4 others) HUDDLE in secret conference -- whispers that sound a lot like MUTINY --
GREAVEY What the hell're we doin' here?
GREAVEY We should be ridin' in the opposite direction of those things --
COBBETT We do that, the old man's likely to shoot us himself.
COBBETT Only way outta this is --
And suddenly.
Greavey SNIFFS the air, FROWNS:
GREAVEY what's that smell?
GREAVEY -- as they TURN to the deck where the creature lays...
GREAVEY ALL THEY
LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the ship -- and als4THE ALIEN behind them.
a coiled mass clinging spiderlike to the ceiling!!!
Its arm WHIPS out, noosing around Cobbett -- LIFTS HIM off his feet -- SLAMS HIM into the ceiling -- TOSSES HIM like a ragdoll: The men SHOUT -- a PAIR OF RAZOR SHARP CANINES extrude from the alien then it SPRINGS -- SLICING THROUGH TWO MEN AT ONCE -- GREAVEY and 2 others manage to SCRAMBLE AWAY:
HEAR the SCREAMS -- Happy takes off -- they RACE after him --
Hear them too -- grabs their PISTOLS -- and Doc, his CANTEEN -- DQIRHXPE_.
9oWQ n Colorado snatches up a WINCHESTER, LOADS IT, throws another one to Dolar -- who's suddenly, surprisingly, PROTECTIVE of Emmett:
DOLARHYDE Get behind me, Boy -- THE ALIEN SPRINGS INTO THE ROOM -- landing upside down on the ceiling.
DOLARHYDE Dolar FIRES at it --
Emmett SCRAMBLES down a FLOOR HATCH, disappears as Dolar keeps FIRING -- but the alien BATS the gun away and LIFTS Dolar UP --
Paralyzed with FEAR, he EXHALES a terrified GASP and -- THE CREATURE RECOILS FROM HIS BREATH!
HURLS Dolar aside -- THROUGH THE FIRE -- embers catch CURTAINS and FLAMES SPREAD -- COLORADO races in, throws a TOMAHAWK -- it PINS the alien's claw to the wall, the monster SHRIEKS as Nat draws a PISTOL but -- The alien SPITS A STICKY RESIN GOB -- it HARDENS, pinning NAT'S hand with the pistol to the wall in return.
He STRUGGLES as the alien ADVANCES -- BOOM!
The Alien's shoulder EXPLODES ORANGE FLUORESCENT BLOOD as a GUNSHOT rings out -- it's Dolarhyde, back on his feet aid FIRING -- the monster SCREECHES and leaps down, DISAPPEARING through the hatch where Emmett fled --
And the fire's GROWING around the boat --
EMMETT moves FAST on hands-and-knees through a narrow CRAWLSPACE -- around a corner here -- another there -- a MAZE --
EMMETT -- reaches another HATCH -- pushes through and OUT:
-- DROPPING onto the floor -- as we WHIP TO Jake racing in from around a corner -- but suddenly: THE ALIEN BURSTS FROM THE HATCH
Jake's bracelet OPENS UP into that BLASTER and it's AIMED at The Alien but the creature CUPS a hand around Emmett and LIFTS HIM off the floor, a TALONED FINGER pressed to the boy's THROAT: STANDOFF.
ELLA rushes in.
The creature sees her -- HISSES --
JAKE Don't know if you understand me...
JAKE but you hurt that boy and I hurt you.
Meacham brings his CANTEEN down like a HATCHET, SPRAYING the alien with HOLY WATER...
but NOTHING happens!
And then -- The Alien STRIKES -- SLAMMING MEACHAM BACK INTO A JUTTING PIECE
The Alien SPRINGS through a doorway, TAKING EMMETT WITH IT.
Ella RUSHES after it as Jake RUNS to Meacham, hanging impaled:
JAKE Easy, now...
JAKE Don't move, dammit --
MEACHAM Go after the boy...
MEACHAM then you get our people back...
JAKE Stop talking.
JAKE DQW!
JAKE GET YOUR ASS--
But Meacham GRABS Jake, EYE TO EYE.
GASPING:
MEACHAM Listen up...
MEACHAM 'cause I'm not gonna be able to say it again --
MEACHAM God don't care who you were, Son...
MEACHAM only who you Mg.
MEACHAM ON JAKE.
MEACHAM AFFECTED.
MEACHAM With a last RASP, Meacham DIES just as DOC races through the growing FLAMES -- REACTS -- no time to mourn --
But Jake can't let go -- FURY -- HEARTBREAK -- Doc PULLS HIM away -- Jake SNAGS THE CRUCIFIX off Meacham's neck as he's forced OUT, leaving Meacham's body to be CONSUMED BY FLAMES --
The boat is a BALL OF FIRE in the pouring rain, as what remains of our heroes stumble out, COUGHING, devastated...
Jake, Doc, Dolarhyde, Colorado, Greavey, 2 GUNMEN...
and Ella and Happy atop a DUNE, following a TRAIL OF FLUORESCENT ORANGE BLOOD streaking into the desert.
Happy BARKING MADLY.
Ella drops to a knee, touches the orange blood as it WASHES AWAY in the rain:
NAT COLORADO That thing...
NAT COLORADO was dead...
NAT COLORADO it was d-ead...
DOLARHYDE, RAIN pouring down his face...
VULNERABLE and GUILTY:
DOLARHYDE I couldn't stop it -- It just...
DOLARHYDE grabbed the kid.
DOLARHYDE ON JAKE.
DOLARHYDE Rage-filled against the flames...
DOLARHYDE Meacham's CRUCIFIX
in his hared, as his FIST closes around it.
Looks up, HARDCORE:
JAKE Then we'd better get him back.
STALACTITES loom from the ceiling -- BAM!
EMMETT is DROPPED on the floor of a sinister cave -- scrambles back from THE ALIEN:
EMMETT Damn.
EMMETT You are one ugly bastar-- PSST!
EMMETT The alien spits a RESIN GOB on Emmett's mouth -- PSST PSST!
EMMETT More gobs PIN his limbs to the wall.
EMMETT Emmett can't move -- can't speak -- eyes WIDE and TERRIFIED -- The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep.
EMMETT Touches a series of keys and the armor spits out what looks like...
EMMETT ..
EMMETT a small RUBIK'S CUBE made of some alien alloy.
EMMETT The creature casually TOSSES IT in the air where it FLOATS and starts to SPIN -- as it does, its sides FLIP AND TURN (like a
Rubik's Cube) -- emitting HIGH-PITCHED SONAR BEEPS: This thing's some kind of HOMING BEACON.
Off Emmett's WIDE, GAPING EYES...
Our people RIDE FAST against the rising sun, on the hunt for Emmett.
Colorado REARS his horse, kneels by a trace of ORANGE BLOOD on some rocks.
NAT COLORADO West.
NAT COLORADO Greavey and the others share a LOOK.
NAT COLORADO E o Turn to Dolar --
GREAVEY Boss, only took one of them things to kill four of us.
GREAVEY We got no chance here.
GREAVEY Dolarhyde BURNS -- knowing he's being ABANDONED --
DOLARHYDE You're a goddamn coward.
DOLARHYDE You work for me, dammit.
DOLARHYDE You're my m e 1 1 Qyees.
And Greavey, finally FREE to speak his mind, says SPITEFULLY:
GREAVEY Fine line between a coward and a fool.
GREAVEY The men turn tail and RIDE AWAY.
GREAVEY Dolarhyde SHOUTS after them --
DOLARHYDE You're all FIRED!
Doc takes the opportunity to TWIST the knife:
DOC Looks like they finally found something to be more scared of than you.
DOC Dolarhyde feels his world CRUMBLING away man by man...
DOC Ella trots alongside Jake, who's staring at that DARK CLOUD MASS
overhead with a bad feeling:
JAKE Clouds've been moving east since sun- up...
JAKE 'cept that one.
JAKE ON ELLA.
JAKE We SENSE she knows something, something more she isn't
saying.
SNAPS her reins and they RIDE OFF:
As the group gallops into a BOX CANYON, Happy starts BARKING MADLY -- the horses SLOW --
BLAMBLAN1111 GUNSHOTS from above suddenly PEPPER the ground -- the horses REAR and KICK UP, startled -- A DOZEN FIGURES ON THE CLIFFS ALL AROUND THEM.
Badass OUTLAWS with RIFLES aimed at our heroes.
One of them CALLS DOWN:
SLOWLY, Jake draws his gun...
tosses it.
Now the rest of them.
As they SEE -- TWO RIDERS -- incoming -- from the other end of the canyon.
Rifles aimed and ready.
Happy GROWLS...
One of the outlaws knocks back the hammer on his rifle --
OUTLAW I say we just shoot 'em and take their--
But the words catch in his throat as his EYES WIDEN:
Boss?
Sure enough, they're looking right at (BRONC -JAKE.
Both outlaws and HUNT) lower their guns, hostility replaced by SURPRISE:
HUNT What the hell you doin' back here, Lonergan?
HUNT Oh, Christ.
HUNT This is JAKE'S gang.
HUNT ON DOLARHYDE.
HUNT ELLA.
HUNT COLORADO.
HUNT All registering it.
HUNT And JAKE, of course, doesn't
REMEMBER these men as Bronc dismounts, NERVOUS:
BRONC Jesus, Boss...
BRONC Creek's gonna shit when he sees you.
BRONC And who the hell're they?
BRONC ON JAKE.
BRONC Now does he handle this?
BRONC Ht:nt rides up next to him, SUSPICIOUS, and for reasons yet to be known, UNFRIENDLY --
HUNT What's the matter, Jake.
HUNT Cat got your--?
HUNT SMACKI Jake moves LIGHTNING FAST, SLAPS Hunt across the face, stopping the question on his tongue -- CATCHES the gun as it
drops and presses the barrel into Hunt's NECK:
JAKE Since when're Qy the one asking the goddamned questions!?!
JAKE Ella and our people REACT as Jake plays it up, beat defense a good OFFENSE.
JAKE The outlaws are SCARED: this is the Lonergan they
know.
Hunt holds his BLOODY MOUTH:
HUNT Christ, Jake...
HUNT You broke my tooth
JAKE Quit whining.
JAKE Now bring me to the rest of the boys, if that meets with your goddamn approval.
Bronc and Hunt nod, mounting up, SHOUTING to the OUTLAWS above:
As they RIDE OFF, Dolarhyde looks to Jake and mutters:
DOLARHYDE Nice company you keep.
ELLA What the hell're you doing?
ELLA If we don't catch up to that kid, we're never gonna--
JAKE They called me "Boss."
JAKE You wanna go after these things with five or fifty?
JAKE Like you said: we can use every gun we can get.
JAKE Qh.
JAKE That actually makes SENSE.
JAKE But --
ELLA What exactly're you gonna say to 'em?
Tell you when I figure it out.
And he SPURS onward, leaving her to follow uneasily --
OUR ALIEN HANGS UPSIDE DOWN from stalactites by four spindly limbs.
Mid sleep cycle.
And inches below its head...
EMMETT, still webbed to the wall.
Unable to move or speak, TERRIFIED.
As suddenly...
the cube DEACTIVATES.
And DROPS -- THE CREATURE'S EYES SNAP OPEN.
It SPRINGS from the ceiling as FOUR DARK SHAPES blot out light, GLIDING IN...
A gang of FOUR MORE ALIENS dismounts.
The biggest and STRONGEST -- their LEADER -- barks GUTTURAL CLICKS at the alien who kidnapped Emmett.
Kidnapper explaining as it removes another STRANGE DEVICE.
The device beams a HOLO-PROJECTION...
OF ELLA'S FACE!
The aliens HISS in furious RECOGNITION.
JESUS...
is this some kind of otherworldly WANTED POSTER?
PLUMES fan out angrily from the Leader's HUGE, ELONGATED SKULL -- like an indian headdress!
The creature TURNS to Emmett -- It's the alien who killed Jake's woman!
We'll come to know it as...
THE SLAVER.
It MOVES OMINOUSLY for Emmett, grasping the HANDLE of something that UNCOILS with fluid, frightening speed: A WHITE-HOT LASER WHIP.
This will be The Slaver's SIGNATURE WEAPON.
It spirals to its full length, FLASHING out at -- EMMETT -- MUFFLED SCREAM!
But...
the whip DOESN'T cut him, instead it SLICES THROUGH THE WEBBING that pins the boy to the wall.
As Emmett FALLS, The Slaver SWEEPS HIM UP -- Emmett FLAILS, punching, kicking to no avail -- but then:
Tumbles from Emmett's pocket and SPLASHES WHISKEY on The Slaver -- IT..
S[iRIEM WILDLI-Aa THE BOOZE CONTACTS FLESH, SKIN SMOKING!
EMMETT -- tumbles away.
Terror turns to REVELATION as he PULLS the webbing from his mouth:
EMMETT Holy SHIT.
EMMETT Another alien LUNGES for the kid but Emmett SPLASHES him with the flask -- the alien RECOILS, flesh BUBBLING -- Emmett whirls -- sees the HOVERBIKES -- JUMPS onto one, twisting desperately at the controls --- IiON-DO , i? 1/2 'T THIS TURNS,__ WO ?!!
EMMETT Another Alien SCUTTLES in FAST -- Emmett's scrambling boots slide into the foot supports, which automatically WHIR CLOSED as the bike THROTTLES FORWARD...
EMMETT DECAPITATING THE ALIEN!
EMMETT The bike SPINS UNCONTROLLABLY, plasma thrusters SCORCHING WALLS and setting two more aliens ABLAZE!
EMMETT The speeder KAMIKAZE BOUNCES out of the cavern at 90 MPH, Emmett screaming!
EMMETT The Slaver SCREECHES FURIOUSLY as the remaining creatures LEAP back on their speeders and GIVE CHASE!
Climbing onto an old desert stump -- BLAM!
It's SHOT OFF by a couple DRUNK OUTLAWS, swigging booze from STOLEN WHISKEY CRATES piled on a WAGON.
We're in an OUTLAW CAMP: roughly 40 fast guns and saddle tramps.
Tents.
Horses.
Ample weapons.
And right now, most of them are GEARING UP to ride out for some reason...
One of them, CREEK JOHNSON, with a chewed up face like swiss cheese, slides a RIFLE into his saddle and shouts to the drunks:
CREEK JOHNSON Hey --- i? 1/2 s 4 Lay off that whiskey and saddle up.
CREEK JOHNSON Flyer's on its way and we best damn be sober for it.
HUNT Creek turns; sees HUNT and BRONC crest the hill with the other
OUTLAWS from the cliffs.
ANGRILY:
CREEK JOHNSON 'Bout time you got back.
CREEK JOHNSON What the hell happened to you?!?
CREEK JOHNSON Hunt nods over his shoulder --
HUNT He did.
HUNT The outlaws part to reveal JAKE, riding in with Ella and the
rest of our people.
Creek's eyes NARROW, NOT happy to see him:
CREEK JOHNSON well, shit.
CREEK JOHNSON It gets very, VERY QUIET.
CREEK JOHNSON Our people tread warily, knowing whatever reaction Jake's eliciting, it AIN'T GOOD.
CREEK JOHNSON He runs the gaunt of ACCUSING GLARES.
CREEK JOHNSON Smart enough to know that CREEK is
the man in charge.
Dismounts:
JAKE You don't look happy to see me, Creek.
Creek eyes him.
TOUGH.
Clearly, HISTORY here:
CREEK JOHNSON We're fixin' to rob us a train in about twenty minutes and you come ridin' in like nothin' ever happened?
No.
Lonergan.
I ain't happy to see you.
ON JAKE.
How to navigate bad blood that he doesn't REMEMBER?
JAKE Well I'm sure you'll get over it.
JAKE Then, pretty much DISMISSING Creek, Jake turns, addresses the rest of the men.
JAKE If he's their boss?
JAKE Hi? 1/2  _gQDn&.
JAKE CT LIR .i? 1/2 Ta??
JAKE (CONT'D) Nice to see you, Boys, but we're not going after a train -- We're going after something else.
JAKE (CONT'D) The men seem...
JAKE (CONT'D) CONFUSED.
JAKE (CONT'D) Not sure what the hell is GOING ON.
BRONC But Jake...
BRONC you-- you said you didn't wanna be in charge no more.
BRONC And this is a REVELATION.
BRONC Jake glances at ELLA -- has to keep
IMPROVISING to hold his ground:
JAKE Well, I-- changed my mind.
JAKE So saddle the hell up.
CREEK JOHNSON They're not going anywhere with you.
Creek's heard enough.
Strides forward, a direct CHALLENGE:
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) You got some balls on you -- walkin' outta here a week ago sayin' what you said and doin' what you did and then ridin' back in here and givin orders.
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) Just who the hell do you think you are?
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks right up to Ella.
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) CLOSE.
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) Violates her space: studies her with a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT.
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) So.
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) Are you her?
ELLA Am I who?
CREEK JOHNSON The whore Jake quit this gang for.
CREEK JOHNSON OH.
CREEK JOHNSON Another piece of the puzzle falls into place -- Jake's eyes SNAP to Ella as they both REALIZE...
CREEK JOHNSON the men think she's
" e."
Jake does his best to stay cool, meets Creek's stare:
JAKE Watch your mouth, Creek.
CREEK JOHNSON Or what?
CREEK JOHNSON These boys are with = now.
CREEK JOHNSON jID in charge.
CREEK JOHNSON You may be fast, but you are goddamned outgunned.
CREEK JOHNSON ON JAKE.
CREEK JOHNSON OUR HEROES.
CREEK JOHNSON Shit.
CREEK JOHNSON Jake turns to the men --
JAKE That a fact, Boys?
But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond:
CREEK JOHNSON Put your guns on the whore.
CREEK JOHNSON He so much as twitches, blow her brains out her ear.
CREEK JOHNSON AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD.
CREEK JOHNSON No doubt as to who
the men are LOYAL to.
But Jake locks into Creek, UNFLINCHING:
JAKE Call her a whore again, that'll be the last word you ever say.
CREEK JOHNSON You ain't in no position to make threats, asshole.
CREEK JOHNSON Hunt: take his gun.
CREEK JOHNSON Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls
the PISTOL from Jake's holster:
HUNT Sorry, Boss...
HUNT nothin' personal.
HUNT Creek now turns to BULL MCCADE, roughly the size of a BARN.
CREEK JOHNSON Put him down, Bull.
CREEK JOHNSON And Jake barely has time to react as Bull lets fly with a JAWBREAKING HAYMAKER that about knocks Jake out of his BOOTSI Dolarhyde and Colorado WINCE as Jake hits the dirt with a THUD --
Creek striding over, cock of the walk, LEANS over him:
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) Where the hell's our gold.
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) Jake?
"Gold?" Jake SPITS BLOOD, defiant:
JAKE Don't remember.
JAKE Creek NODS to Bull: SMASH!
JAKE Another devastating BLOW.
JAKE ON ELLA -- at GUNPOINT.
JAKE Wishing she could intervene.
JAKE DOC too.
CREEK JOHNSON Well I _dg remember you tellin' us you was leavin' us high and dry because you were in love...
CREEK JOHNSON You just left out the part about taking half our goddamned haul from the Yuma Bank.
CREEK JOHNSON So I'm gonna ask you one last time -- Where.
CREEK JOHNSON Is.
CREEK JOHNSON Our.
CREEK JOHNSON Gold?
-- WHAM!
Bull PUNCHES Jake so hard he FLIES OFF HIS FEET:
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) Man can't run away from who he ja, Lonergan...
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) you really think you could go straight just cause you were fool enough to fall in love with some woman?
WHAM!
Bull PUNCHES Jake back into oblivion, and on the HIT we: MEMORY FLASECUTi PEACEFUL SILENCE -- two FACES staring at each other across a pillow -- Jake and ALICE, naked, in a WHOREHOUSE
ALICE You sure you wanna give it all up?
ALICE ON JAKE.
ALICE Clearly TORN.
ALICE But just as clearly, in LOVE.
JAKE What about you?
JAKE Once we're gone, you ain't ever comin' back.
She touches his face so gently.
And whispers:
ALICE You're the first person ever believed I was better than this place...
ALICE so I gotta believe in y=.
ALICE You're a good man, Jake Lonergan.
ALICE PRESENT: as the words "Good Man" ECHO back to Jake.
ALICE Stir=g_
]1a??1n as Creek GRABS Jake's hair and YANKS BACK, rears up a fist:
CREEK JOHNSON You figgered you could steal from us?
CREEK JOHNSON All that gold was yours to take co you could go off and start a new life?
Creek's next PUNCH takes us to another: TORY FLASECUTI REPLAY -- Jake and Alice in the cabin -- he drops the SADDLEBAG -- it CLINKS to the floor.
She's worried:
ALICE Your boys'ii come after you.
JAKE Let 'em come.
JAKE BACK TO PRESENT -- as now Jake UNDERSTANDS the context of this moment -- what they were saying to each other -- He looks up at
Creek, BEATEN AND BUSTED UP:
JAKE (CONT'D) Okay...
JAKE (CONT'D) okay, I remember now...
JAKE (CONT'D) Demons stole your gold, Creek.
JAKE (CONT'D) But when you get to hell, you can ask for it back.
Okay then.
That's the way you wanna do this...
Kill the whore.
ON THE GANG.
As they all cock their guns -- Aimed at Ella -- This is IT -- JAKE -- slowly lifts his head, suddenly RAGE-FILLED as --
EVERYONE'S FACES.
Holy shit.
Jake spits on the around between the SMOKING BOOTS that formerly belonged to Creek:
JAKE Told you not to call her that.
JAKE ON JAKE.
JAKE Pure KILLER.
JAKE As he turns his weapon on the rest of
the (awestruck) gang -- through BLOODY TEETH:
JAKE (CONT'D) You're all riding with me.
JAKE (CONT'D) Any one of you decides otherwise?
JAKE (CONT'D) So help me God, I'll kill you where you stand.
I'm j2acj& and I'M in goddamne.d The gang quickly flips: "Absolutely, Jake/ Whatever you say, Boss..."
Jake turns to the speechless Bull McCade and KICKS HIM IN THE BALLS as hard as he can, doubling him over.
Now he meets eyes with ELLA.
She can't help SMIRKING, grateful.
DOC.
Is the only one NOT looking at Jake.
His attention drawn toward a SOUND coming from the distant DUNES --
DOC Dios mio.
DOLARHYDE Jesus...
DOLARHYDE it's the kid.
As Emmett ROARS IN, the shocked outlaws SCATTER:
The kid TUMBLES off the speeder as it PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH CAMP, kicking up DIRT and UPENDING SUPPLIES.
As Emmett scrambles up --
Those who have their wits about them FIRE BACK, trying to hit the flying machines.
CROSSFIRE.
CONFUSION.
THE SLAVER His speeder GROWLS to a halt.
THE SLAVER Dismounting like a killer biker.
ON JAKE.
As he SEES that horrible alien face across the crowd: QUICK BIT: Alice dying in his arms.
And this same damn THING is the one responsible for it.
And we're: BACK TO PRESENT.
Jake's eyes LOCKED on the SLAVER as he says:
JAKE (CONT'D) You.
Outlaws start FIRING at the Slaver, who REACTS in mere annoyance.
Flicks open a POUCH on his bandolier for what look like THUMB TACKS -- throws them and they tan out, PIERCING THE NECKS of the outlaws, activating "Blue": !NTLY E ZE.
TUR an The Slaver draws a ROL) that TELESCOPES into a SIX FOOT LANCE -- KA-TCHING!
BARBED ENDS snap out and the alien runs on two limbs, then FOUR -- LEOPARD-LIKE for speed -- rises back up and SMASH!
SHATTERS each man into a million Pieces.
Now he uses the bladed-ends to SKEWER five more outlaws and turns --
Find cover!!!
Jake FIRES his pulse blaster, providing cover as DOLAR, DOC, EMMETT, and ELLA rush to hide behind the WAGON.
The Aliens FIRE BACK as LASER CROSSFIRE shreds the camp -- EXPLOSIONS and CHAOS: THREE OUTLAWS scramble to form a GATLING CREW.
It SPINS to life, MOWING DOWN tents as they try to hit the aliens --
Hurls a boomerang-like "SMART WEAPON."
It circles past the GATLING COWBOYS, BACK into the alien's hand as:
An EXPLOSION blows one of whiskey crates open on the wagon:
Ella REACTS -- WHAT?
As an alien SKITTERS toward her, she grabs a bottle and HURLS IT -- it EXPLODES all over the creature!
A HORRIBLE SCREECH as its skin smokes, thrashing epileptically --
Oh my GOD --
LET'S GO!!! Our people ESCAPE for the horses.
LET'S GO!!! Doc climbs up on the WAGON buckboard and pulls EMMETT in the seat beside him -- As ELLA leaps on a horse --
THE SLAVER Climbs back on his speeder and GUNS FOR HER, firing a STEEL
COLLAR -- Jake turns -- SEES THIS.
Starts RUNNING MADLY:
Too late: KA-CHANK!
The collar CLAMPS her neck, RIPPING ELLA OFF HER HORSE!
The CABLE snaps back and attaches to the hovercraft as it ZIPS by, DRAGGING ELLA BACKWARD LIKE A WATER
ON JAKE -- FURY -- HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES!
And there's a LOGIC here we'll come to realize, as he KICKS his horse into a gallop:
ELLA'S DRAGGED BEHIND THE SPEEDER.
Hands GRASPING at the magnetic collar as it HALF-CHOKES HER, yet keeps her upper body SUSPENDED just oft the ground while her heels BOUNCE HARSHLY --
Riding hard -- aims his BLASTER, trying to get a TARGET on the CABLE linking Ella's collar to the speeder -- fires -- MISSES!
The Slaver TILTS VERTICAL to fly through a narrow CANYON ENTRANCE as Ella's fingers reach wildly for THE BOWIE KNIFE on her belt.
She starts CUTTING THE CABLE, trying to FREE HERSELF: WHOOSH!
The speeder BLASTS out the other side of the canyon, Jake still in pursuit but suddenly...
RIGHT FOR THEM!
This is the train Jake's gang was gonna rob!
Two PINKERTONS sit by a SAFE.
LOOK UP at an unidentified ROAR --
You hear.that?
How many times I gotta tell you, Leonard.
No one'd be stupid enough to rob this tr--
When the Pinkertons SNAP around, Ella's GONE...
but now they SEE JAKE -- ON HORSEBACK -- FLASHING PAST in pursuit!
1 stand corrected.
They DRAW GUNS, running to see what's happening and --
As the speeder SKIMS alongside the train, ELLA keeps struggling painfully to CUT HER COLLAR CABLE.
Jake FIRES again, MISSES the cable but DETONATES THE SIDE OF A TRAIN CAR:
The wall EXPLODES INWARD on the Pinkertons -- hurt, but ALIVE --
The speeder's SHAKEN.
The Slaver GROWLS as he fights for balance.
Reaches the TRAIN'S END, skims past the caboose and --
IN FOR COVER BEHIND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TMINa??,=_`T1.2AVF.LLING,.J
Through a slot between boxcars, the speeder BLURS in the opposite direction.
Up ahead comes the CABOOSE.
No more TRAIN: Thinking FAST, Jake LEAPS off his horse -- CATCHES A LADDER RUNG ON THE CABOOSE'.
Teeth gritted, starts to CLIMB up onto:
Jake JUMPS from car to car -- over LOGS in a TENDER CAR -- BLAM BLAM!!!
The PINKERTONS are climbing to the roof, WEAPONS FIRING -- Jake loses footing, ROLLING off the side --
-- but CATCHES another ladder rung and he DANGLES, looks DOWN:
She GRUNTS WITH EXERTION as their fingers GRAZE each other and The Slaver SNAPS AROUND.
Hurls a SMART DISC at Jake -- no choice, he LETS GO of the LADDER -- HITS the ground PAINFULLY
-- SXLSKLISH!
The disc VIVISECTS THEM THEN CIRCLES BACK AROUND, cutting the IRON STRAPS that secure the logs in the tender car --
SPEEDER.
It SPIRALS end-over-end, CRASHING into the desert!
ON JAKE.
He picks himself up, WINCING.
Sees the SMOKING WRECK in the distance.
Starts to limp, then RUN --
Jake APPEARS through the smoke.
No sign of The Slaver.
Then -- FALLING ROCKS turns his look upward.
Though WOUNDED, the alien is SCALING a rock-face.
Turns...
a look that says "Next time."
Then in a BLUR, it's GONE.
Jake's blaster REVERTS into a bracelet.
When the smoke clears: ELLA is revealed on the ground, thrown from the speeder.
Jake REACTS -- EQ -- takes her in his arms.
She desperately tries to SAY SOMETHING...
but goes LIMP.
JAKE Ella...?
JAKE Her head just falls back.
JAKE Yeah.
JAKE Hard to swallow, but it's true.
JAKE ELLA'S DEAD.
JAKE And if this moment ECHOES Jake holding his dead wife, well that's just fine.
JAKE He stares beseechingly as...
JAKE HOOFBEATS.
JAKE The rest of our people gallop in: Colorado,
Dolarhyde, Doc and Emmett in the wagon:
EMMETT Aw no...
EMMETT is she --?
EMMETT Jake looks up -- unhinged --
NAT COLORADO We need to get out of here NOT.
Not gonna leave her here -- L4Re.Xam -- -- I'M NOT LEAVIN' HER!
-- This is Apache territory!
They catch us, they'll kill u-- THHHHHHHUNKI The air SCREAMS as an ARROW pierces the ground inches from Jake's hand!
Suddenly THIRTY MORE -- ALL AROUND THEM -- forming an instant circle perimeter as -- APACHE WARRIORS FLASH DOWNHILL.
Dolar dismounts, swings Emmett to the ground --
Nobody move.
Jake and Emmett freeze.
The Apaches are ALL AROUND THEM.
Fierce.
BOWS and TOMAHAWKS drawn -- OFF THIS:
The sun DIPS behind the mountains...
NIGHT FALLS...
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT CLOSE ON ELLA'S DEAD FACE.
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT Still.
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT Beautiful.
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT FIND JAKE, on his knees beside her, hands bound in front of him.
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT An INDIAN WOMAN finishes wrapping the body in a shroud and LEAVES.
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT Jake is alone.
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT Overwhelmed.
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT Raw.
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT Something rising in him.
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT Something he COULDN'T FACE...
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT until this moment:.
JAKE I remember now.
I-- I did love her.
And just saying it, saying those words, brings a swell of EMOTION to the surface...
but he FIGHTS it.
A losing battle, as his eyes WELL:
JAKE (CONT'D) She was like you.
JAKE (CONT'D) Seemed to think I was a good man.
JAKE (CONT'D) (finally, voice almost
But I couldn't save either of you.
A beat...
his bound hands gently touch her face...
Where's the good in that?
His eyes CLOSE.
Too much.
JAKE (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Ella.
JAKE (CONT'D) And that sits...
JAKE (CONT'D) then suddenly -- JARRINGLY -- THREE MORE BRAVES
roughly enter, pull Jake up, FORCE HIM out:
BAN!
Our people are THROWN TO THEIR KNEES in a large CIRCLE OF APACHES.
GUARDED by warriors with tomahawks and -- WHOOSH!
A PYRE is ignited and if we ever had any doubt about Ella being dead, the BRAVES carry her roughly past --
-- he's YANKED BACK and held in place as...
ELLAIg BODY IS THROWN RIGHT INTO THE FLAMES.
Jake helplessly watches her BURN.
EMMETT Wasn't your fault, Mr. Lonergan.
EMMETT Those things...
EMMETT were lookin' for her.
EMMETT Had a picture and everything.
EMMETT That breaks the spell.
EMMETT Jake looks over --
JAKE What d'you mean...
JAKE 'a picture'?
EMMETT Floatin', like that arrow thing we found in its eye.
EMMETT Before Jake can makes sense of this, a teepee smoke flap OPENS and out steps the tribe's SACHEM.
EMMETT This is GREY WOLF -- dark, wrinkled face enhanced by TATTOOS.
EMMETT He takes one look at his prisoners and SPEAKS A FEW WORDS OF APACHE.
DOC What'd he say?
COLORADO "Kill them.
COLORADO And make it quick."
COLORADO Doc is amply freaked.
COLORADO Turns to Jake as FIVE OF THE BRAVES move for them, MENACING --
DOC Now'd be a good time to use your gun bracelet, my friend.
DOC But Jake is VACANT.
DOC BROKEN.
DOC All the fight seems GONE from him.
DOC His bracelet DOESN'T MOVE.
DOC Dolarhyde's grabbed first...
DOC PULLED FORWARD by one of the braves, raising his TOMAHAWK -- they're really gonna KILL HIM --
SURPRISED looks from just about everyone in the camp (besides Colorado) as we realize Dolarhyde just spoke APA ON GREY WOLF -- INTRIGUED as he approaches Dolarhyde:
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) How is it that you speak our language?
Because I'm a damn genius.
Grey Wolf's fascinated this man has the audacity to be a WISEASS given his circumstances.
Turns to the Brave with the tomahawk --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Forget about quick.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Make him feel it.
The Brave NODS, RAISES the Tomahawk again, but Dolar interrupts:
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Two hundred head of cattle!
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Grey Wolf holds up his hand, halting the Brave's death blow --
I'll have two hundred head of cattle u_a here in a day's time if you let me go.
ON GREY WOLF.
Considering this.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) And how do I know you'll come back?
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Dolarhyde nods to Colorado --
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) You can keep my associate here.
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) if I don ' t come back, you can kill him.
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Colorado REACTS.
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) He's the only one here who knows what the hell these two are saying to each other as Grey Wolf approaches Dolar, looks right INTO HIM --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Why should I believe that you even care about this man?
Dolarhyde's eyes flash EMOTION.
Quickly bottled.
Then:
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Because he's my son.
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Wow.
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Didn't see that one coming.
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Grey Wolf levels Colorado with those unyielding eyes --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Is this true?
And Colorado answers in ENGLISH, for the benefit of the others:
COLORADO Yeah...
COLORADO he's my father.
REACTIONS.
JAKE.
EMMETT.
DOC.
Stunned silence.
And so:
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Three hundred head.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Dolar looks to Colorado, who won't meet his eyes.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) His FATHER's eyes.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Turns back to Grey Wolf, HARD --
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Two fifty.
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) HOLD ON GREY WOLF for a beat.
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Then --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Cut him loose.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) The Brave does exactly that.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Dolar's FREE to go...
EMMETT Hey!
EMMETT What about =?!?
EMMETT ON DOLAR.
EMMETT A FLASH of regret.
EMMETT But it's gone fast.
DOLARHYDE What about you, kid?
DOLARHYDE And he just walks out of the camp, leaving his son behind...
DOLARHYDE GONE.
DOLARHYDE And now, it's back to business --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Kill all of them except the half-breed.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Our people are GRABBED.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Jake's yanked forward, PINNED DOWN -- a Brave raises a HATCHET to kill Jake, who glares back with
lunatic eyes.
Ready to die.
Almost wanting it:
JAKE What're you waiting for, asshole?
JAKE DO IT.
And as Jake's about to MEET HIS DEATH:
Except she isn't exactly Ella.
She's a HUMANOID, incredibly close to us in physical appearance, her features acutely feminine, yet...
ALJM.
PANDEMONIUM.
The Apache kneel in prostration, DROPPING weapons as flames DISSIPATE off Ella's backlit form.
Her skin RETURNS to human flesh-tone.
Hair too.
When she finally STOPS, she looks like the ELLA we've come to know and love.
STANDS there:
ELLA what...
ELLA happened?
ELLA ON JAKE.
ELLA Holy.
ELLA SHIT.
ELLA Everyone else equally STUNNED.
EMMETT You...
EMMETT died.
Ella looks around.
Fifty dumbstruck faces staring at her.
oh.
OFF ELLA, who's got a helluva lot to explain --
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT A deerskin shirt slips down over Ella's naked body.' A dark breechcloth is tied.
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT She TURNS to us.: beautiful as ever.
Ella emerges to find...
JAKE.
Standing outside.the teepee.
HARD.
And for a long moment, nothing is said.
Until she takes a step TOWARD him:
ELLA If I'd told you on the boat, you never would'a trusted me -- -- but he takes a step BACK.
ELLA If he's relieved she's alive, he
isn't showing it:
JAKE Did you hear what I said?
ELLA ..
ELLA What?
JAKE When you were playin' possum.
JAKE Did you hear what I mid?
JAKE He's angry.
JAKE Yes, even embarrassed.
JAKE And because of it, something has SHUT DOWN in him again.
JAKE That killer look is back.
ELLA No.
ELLA I was mendin'.
It's like sleep.
His eyes narrow, trying to understand:
JAKE How's it you look like one of us?
ELLA I can look like whatever I want to.
JAKE So you can't die?
ELLA Sure I can.
ELLA If my heart stops beating...
ELLA just like you.
You're nothin' like me, Ella.
You're one'a them.
we can see that hurt her.
But she deserved it, too.
So desperately wants to reach him...
ELLA I'm not, Jake.
ELLA I'm from a different place.
ELLA He isn't sure what that means.
ELLA Can he even trust her?
ELLA Either
way, she has ANSWER;.
Darkly:
JAKE The one that took you.
It killed her.
That LANDS on her.
Knowing and painful.
ELLA They call him The Slaver.
ELLA He's the one, gave me the scars.
ELLA Broke me.
ELLA And made me watch...
ELLA while he killed my family too.
ELLA Even with his guard up...
ELLA Jake can't help but be STRUCK.
ELLA As the
sound of HOWLING WIND takes us to:
A SANDSTORM...
through which a GHOSTLY FIGURE materializes...
THE SLAVER.
Moving with angry purpose toward the CANYON BLUFF.
As he looks down into it, we hear the SOUNDS of MACHINERY below.
But we DO__QT.YET_ REVEAL what it_ is__ he sees.
He stalks down, LEAVING FRAME -- as we HOLD on the field of
For every drop of light in the sky, there's another world.
Filled with life...
Ella's in front of the campfire, surrounded by EVERYONE
ELLA Our race was first to map the stars...
ELLA that's why they came for us.
ELLA Took our planet, piece by piece.
ELLA Slaughtered anyone who fought hack.
ELLA Ones who survived were turned into slaves.
ELLA Trackers.
ELLA She says this meeting the eyes of GREY WOLF.
ELLA There's immediate SIMPATICO here: a story the Indians could be telling.
ELLA (CONT'D) They brought me aboard one of their scout ships -- a ship with only one purpose: to find other planets like mine.
ELLA (CONT'D) Planets they can take...
ELLA (CONT'D) people they can enslave.
ELLA (CONT'D) As the terrible gravity of all this HITS everyone, JAKE is first to understand...
JAKE X lead 'em here.
JAKE Ella swallows.
JAKE Wracked with GUILT.
EMMETT Well damn, lady, thanks a 1.
ELLA I never wanted this.
ELLA But they got...
ELLA ways.
ELLA Of making you do things.
ELLA Her eyes are HAUNTED with memory.
ELLA The inference is some kind of
TORTURE.
She pushes it away -- staying strong:
ELLA (CONT'D) Been tryin' to make it right...
ELLA (CONT'D) tried to blow the ship to hell by burnin' up all their fuel, then escaped down here.
'Cept it didn't work...
damn thing survived.
JAKE Where is it.
JAKE Jake's determined -- he's got his OWN agenda.
JAKE Ella looks up to
that OMINOUS CLOUD.
Those BLUE LIGHT FLASHES ripple within:
ELLA Hiding in that cloud.
ELLA Way I figure, they'll find enough fuel to leave by tomorrow, midday.
ELLA Then they'll bring back the others.
DOC "others"?
ELLA The whole fleet.
ELLA They'll take what they need.
ELLA Everyone on this planet.
ELLA Anything too weak to survive...
ELLA they'll toss.
ELLA Like that cow.
ELLA Tomorrow.
ELLA Midday.
ELLA Hi noon.
ELLA This is bad, bad news.
NAT COLORADO What'd you mean, they're looking for "fuel"...?
And before Ella can answer, Jake already GETS IT:
JAKE Gold.
JAKE That's why they're in a mine.
ELLA wherever it is, that's where you escaped from -- and it's the only way back up to the ship.
Even with your memory wiped, your instincts kicked in --
That's how it works, Jake, the bracelet reads your impulse -- you wanna fight, it reacts.
Somehow you took it off one of 'em...
don't you remember any of it?
ON JAKE.
Deeply STIRRED.
As he looks down at the BRACELET and: MEMORY FLASBCUTSI REPLAY POV as we're HELD DOWN in that CAVE the TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes One of the ALIENS starts to activate the probe -- it begins to FLASH STEADILY -- HYPNOTICALLY -- PUvTNG OUR MIND -- But our arm manages to BREAK FREE -- a BLADE hidden in our sleeve -- WE SLASH OFF THE.
ALIEN'S HAND -- GRAB THE BRACELET off its severed limb -- it COILS around our wrist and ACTIVATES: BLAM SLAM!
We BLAST the creature to oblivion -- we're FREE!
JAKE IN PRESENT -- Eyes ALIVE with MEMORY:
JAKE I-- I blasted my way out...
JAKE MEMORY FLASHCUTI REPLAY POV as we RUN through the cavern -- ESCAPE -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits
us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see:
That STRANGE ROCK FORMATION HIGH ABOVE on the edge of a CANYON -- the STONE TOWER pointing to heaven -- JAKE IN PRESENT: The sequencing is COMPLETE for him now:
JAKE (CONT'D) I remember seeing a tower...
JAKE (CONT'D) made of stone...
JAKE (CONT'D) on the rim of a canyon...
JAKE (CONT'D) Upon hearing that, Grey Wolf suddenly speaks in animated
gestures, pointing North.
Colorado REACTS:
ELLA What?
ELLA What's he sayin'?!?
Colorado turns to Jake, a flicker of HOPE:
COLORADO That rock you're talkin' about...
COLORADO he- knows where it is.
The Slaver ENTERS the gloom of an UNDERGROUND CAVERN.
Two ALIENS melt from the dark to greet him with frightening HISSES.
SENTRIES.
We HOLD on the walls as something GLITTERS: GOLD.
CLOSE ON SHERIFF TAGGART'S REFLECTION IN MURKY WATER.
As we TILT UP to reveal him hanging UPSIDE DOWN.
Eyes flutter open.
He's seen better days.
Dazed.
Turns his head slightly...
SHERIFF TAGGART You...
SHERIFF TAGGART all right...?
SHERIFF TAGGART DRIFTING over to see MARIA.
SHERIFF TAGGART Gravity PULLING her hair downward.
Groggy.
Mostly SCARED:
Fantastic.
You?
STUCK TO THE CEILING OVER A WATER GROTTO.
The whole town of Absolution is here...
a hundred others from the now-cratered town of Winfield's Landing, feet embedded in the ORANGE RESIN.
Suddenly, PERCY DOLARHYDE sees a TERRIFYING SHADOW spread across the wall -- what looks like a HUGE, COILING SNAKE:
-- but what comes around the corner is a LONG METAL TENTACLE:
A SCANNING MECHANISM on its tip shoots out a blue triangular beam -- itemizing specimens -- SELECTING ONE: SHERIFF TAGGART.
Mechanized TALONS open up -- Taggart SCREAMS as he's PLUCKED from the ceiling like an apple from a TREE:
ANOTHER METAL TENTACLE slithers in and GRABS WADE -- swinging our men across the cavern where we reveal...
the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE.
Taggart and Wade are PINNED DOWN on what looks like an operating table.
As they thrash, RESTRAINING CLAMPS enfold their skulls.
An OCULAR PROBE looms _Q.Xpr.
them, This is the image _ e.'_A_beM1_ seeing!
This is what haRpened to him before he escaRe !
WORKER-BEE ALIENS adjusts the device over their eyes -- INSTANT X-RAYS read their retinas -- HYPNOTIC -- as the men grow DOCILE and LIMP despite their fight and -- FLASHFLASHTLASHI The probe has ERASED THEIR MINDS.
Catatonic stares.
Now the machine arms slip the men into separate TRANSLUCENT CAPSULES.
METAL BREATHING TUBES are implanted down their throats as the capsules begin to fill with a THICK, BLUE LIQUID.
This is the same blue goo -- a protective gel -- that housed the COW in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert.
More Worker Bees load the cocoons into TRANSPORT SHUTTLECRAFTS.
We see containment holds filled with BLEATING COWS and REARING HORSES...
all going through a similar cocooning process.
All of this is overseen by THE SLAVER, who stalks up a ramp behind the cocoons.
The craft HUMS to life, undergear retracting as it ROARS OFF down the tunnel...
Our people ride up a rocky slope with a few Apaches.
Grey Wolf looks around and SPEAKS, Colorado translates:
NAT COLORADO This is Kiowa land, their sister tribe.
As they near the bluff, Jake sees the STONE TOWER.
Dismounts:
JAKE That's it.
JAKE As they near the bluff, they hear the growing sound of that MACHINERY.
JAKE Everyone dips low, peering over to see...
What looks a whole lot like a CAVALRY FORT in the canyon below, amid a network of trenches and underground tunnels.
Except this fortress is made of some kind of ALIEN ALLOY, glowing impossibly bright as its steel surface reflects the rising sun.
DRILLING MACHINES are chewing deep into the earth, mining for
Massive receptacles are FILLED with HUGE CHUNKS.
ALIENS move in and out, working, as if from an ant hive.
DOC Holy Jesus.
DOC Like a damn fort.
Grey Wolf looks to his men, GRAVE, CRESTFALLEN as he realizes:
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) The Kiowa...
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) they were taken too.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Suddenly, the ROOF of the steel structure blossoms open like a CHROME LOTUS...
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) and WHOOSH!
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) The SHUTTLE TRANSPORT flies out of the canyon, RISING into the dawn sky...
ELLA Transports.
ELLA Way they get people and gold back and forth to the ship.
DOC Place is crawling with those things.
DOC We'll never even get close.
DOC Grey Wolf SPEAKS --
NAT COLORADO He says there's a back way in...
NAT COLORADO The Twin Rivers run underneath this whole canyon.
NAT COLORADO Limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple miles East.
NAT COLORADO Lead right down there.
NAT COLORADO Jake looks to the SKY.
NAT COLORADO DARK.
NAT COLORADO DETERMINED.
JAKE The Slaver...
JAKE he's up in that big cloud?
JAKE Ella nods, HARD.
JAKE Off their SHARED DETERMINATION, our SCORE
rises.
A DRUM CADENCE that suggests a MISSION starting to form:
DOC.
Skeptical, eyes narrow -- staring at Jake and Ella -- surrounded by our team and the Apaches back at the APACHE CAMP:
DOC Just so I got this straight...
DOC three of those things just kicked the shit out of your entire gang, took our whole town, and now you two're gonna ride right into that fort, try to hijack one'a those-- He pauses on the word --
ELLA "Transports."
DOC -- ride it up to that space boat --
ELLA Spaceshp.
DOC Then bring it down here and get everybody off alive?
DOC That's your big plan?
Jake and Ella share a LOOK.
Simply:
JAKE Yup.
DOC And just how do you figure on getting in there in the first place?
JAKE Poke a hornet's nest...
JAKE they swarm at'cha.
ELLA You gotta draw 'em out.
ELLA Buy us a distraction.
A long beat of incredulous, do-you-believe-this-shit STARES:
DOC You want us to storm that fort?
DOC Against those things?
DOC With less than fifty men?
DOC It's suicide.
EMMETT It ain't, it's been done!
EMMETT I read at school how Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys took Fort Ticonderoga, they weren't but a small garrison and they were outgunned --
ELLA We need all of you to make a stand.
ELLA Together.
ELLA It's the only way.
NAT COLORADO Make a stand with what?
NAT COLORADO Jake turns to the WAGON they rode from Jake's gang camp -- the
WHISKEY CRATES.
Sweeps up a bottle:
JAKE This.
JAKE An impossible mission.
JAKE Sure death.
JAKE Yet for the first time...
they have an ADVANTAGE.
Emmett cuts the moment with a BIG GRIN:
EMMETT Hell, yeah.
EMMETT Let's squish some bugs.
Grey Wolf CHUCKLES, murmurs.
Jake looks to Nat for translation:
JAKE Somethin' funny?
NAT COLORADO Yeah...
NAT COLORADO that you whites finally know what it feels like to face extinction.
NAT COLORADO Now that we're on the same side, he says we can all die together.
They're with us.
The LOOK holds between them --
JAKE Guess that means you're not waitin' for your dad to come back.
Colorado's face CLOUDS.
Years of ANGER and RESENTMENT:
NAT COLORADO Been Woodrow Dolarhyde's son my whole life...
NAT COLORADO first time he ever copped to it was to save his own ass.
NAT COLORADO He's not comin' back.
NAT COLORADO And as Colorado TURNS away, the PERCUSSION finds another GEAR --
Pieces of CLOTH are RIPPED, stuffed inside the WHISKEY BOTTLES.
Emmett works with Apaches and their KIDS, roping WOOD together to build LADDERS and CATAPULTS...
WAR PAINT is applied to faces in DARK STREAKS...
Jake slips on his coat.
Sees Emmett lead a horse to mount up with his BOW and ARROW QUIVER:
JAKE Not you, Kid.
EMMETT Aw, hell, we been through this.
EMMETT Ya can't stop me.
Jake draws his gun, SPINS it in his palm, aims at Emmett's FOOT:
JAKE I can shoot you in the foot.
EMMETT Bu111i11SHIT.
EMMETT Jake SIGHS -- bluff called.
EMMETT Holsters the gun and takes a knee...
EMMETT but just when we think this is gonna be a tender moment,
he GRABS Emmett by the collar, pulls him CLOSE:
JAKE You told me your daddy's all you got left.
JAKE Want me to save his ass?
JAKE Then park yours right there on the ground, you little shit.
JAKE Got me?
JAKE Emmett's nailed.
JAKE ANGRY, but knows he's gotta stay.
EMMETT Yeah.
EMMETT I gotcha.
Jake releases him.
Happy moves to Ella but she TSKS:
ELLA Stay with the kid, Happy.
ELLA The dog WHINES but complies, moving next to Emmett.
ELLA Jake climbs
on his horse.
Looks back to the boy -- now he Ia tender:
JAKE I'll get your father back.
JAKE Bastard still owes me fifty dollars.
JAKE The hint of a SMIRK...
JAKE long enough for Emmett to SMIRK BACK.
JAKE Ella, Doc, and Colorado mount A>>p too, along with a 10-MAN APACHE
WAR PARTY.
Jake meets eyes with GREY WOLF:
JAKE (CONT'D) You'll be ready?
JAKE (CONT'D) Grey Wolf NODS.
JAKE (CONT'D) Some part of the PLAN we have yet to learn.
JAKE (CONT'D) And now Jake starts to trot off, Ella beside him.
JAKE (CONT'D) This plays
just between the two of them:
ELLA That's a nice thing...
ELLA what you said to the boy.
ELLA I didn't know better, I'd say you got yourself a sweet side.
She smiles.
But Jake turns to her -- deadly serious:
JAKE There's nothin' sweet about me.
JAKE I told that kid what he needed to hear so he wouldn't get in my damn way.
JAKE All I care about is killin' that thing.
And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice.
Shakes her head:
ELLA I don't believe that.
JAKE Well believe it.
JAKE I was playing a part.
JAKE Just like you were.
JAKE He CRACKS the reins, riding ahead.
JAKE HOLD ON ELLA...
JAKE who finally
follows as they all ride out and MUSIC SOARS:
THUNDERING HOOVES -- but it's DOLARHYDE on his horse.
REARS near the SERVANTS QUARTERS -- moving FAST toward a small hut: A HATCHET is embedded in a wood pile.
Dolarhyde YANKS it out.
The APACHE WOMAN we saw in the drawn-and-quartered scene earlier is washing clothes on a basin board.
She turns as -- Dolarhyde ENTERS.
A menacing figure with a blade in the doorway.
She stands, ALERT -- in SUBTITLED APACHE:
What are you doing?
Without response, he levels the axe and SLAMS it down on the FLOORBOARDS.
Wood chips SPRAY until a GASH is opened.
Dolar REACHES in...
pulling out a CANVAS BAG.
A few COINS spill out...
COLD.
He picks them up -- looks at the woman:
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Need it to save Nat.
And now her worry becomes FEAR; English now:
THE WOMAN Is he okay?
DOLARHYDE He's gonna be.
DOLARHYDE A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes.
DOLARHYDE That stoic Dolarhyde veneer starts to CRACK...
DOLARHYDE just a hint...
DOLARHYDE as the woman MOVES to him...
DOLARHYDE and TOUCHES his face.
DOLARHYDE And he lets her.
DOLARHYDE WHOA.
DOLARHYDE We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S MOTHER.
DOLARHYDE Dolarhyde, for all his wicked bluster, LOVES AN APACHE.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) I won't let anything happen to him, Jenny.
Come back to me.
With that, he's GONE with the gold.
Leaving her full of DREAD.
A CASCADING WATERFALL flows over rock face into the TWIN RIVERS.
The water curtain covers a CAVERN ENTRANCE.
The back way in.
Jake, Ella, Doc, Colorado and the Apaches cross slippery rocks and push through the water...
Behind the curtain, they shake off the wet and remove TORCHES from waterproof buffalo-hide pouches.
FIRELIGHT as our team creeps along in a column.
TENSE.
Jake glances at Colorado:
JAKE You and Percy're brothers, huh?
NAT COLORADO ...
NAT COLORADO half.
JAKE So...
JAKE your momma and Dolarhyde---
NAT COLORADO We friends now?
NAT COLORADO Last I checked, you shot my ear off.
JAKE Want it back?
Colorado GRUMBLES, pushes ahead of Jake...
A BUZZARD picks at the EAR of a DEAD GANG MEMBER.
More birds scavenge the dismembered remains of JAKE'S CREW as the rest of its LIVING MEMBERS -- roughly 30 -- tend wounds and get ready to move on.
One of them looks up...
..
and sees an INCOMING RIDER on the horizon:
BRONC and HUNT look up.
Draws their GUNS.
So does the rest of the gang...
until they see the rider's waving a WHITE FLAG.
As he comes closer -- they realize it's DOLARHYDE:
HUNT One of them fellas Jake was ridin' with!
HUNT Dolarhyde rides into camp, REARING in front of 30 guns
BRONC The hell you want?
DOLARHYDE It's about what you want.
He reaches into his pocket and tosses Bronc a GOLD COIN:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Lonergan stole your gold.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) That's a taste of what I got -- more'n you've ever seen.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) It's all yours if you help me get my boy back.
The men trade LOOKS.
Bronc eyes the coin.
Alight with greed:
BRONC Who's got your boy?
DOLARHYDE Well, there's the rub.
I got two.
Off that --
Our team has travelled far into the bowels of the cavern.
Jake STOPS, torchlight reflecting the GOLD in the cavern walls.
Doc cracks off a piece.
POCKETS it.
Shrugs:
DOC In case we live through this.
DOC They SNEAK on down the narrow shaft til they're funneled into...
Where our TOWNSPEOPLE were hanging.
Now, GONE.
Around the corner, the sound of ENGINES POWERING UP...
A TRANSPORT.
A dozen WORKER-BEE ALIENS try to corral the HORSES from the pen -- cruelly jabbing the animals with ALIEN CATTLE PRODS.
The mares REAR and WHINNY.
JAKE We're never gonna get close to that ship.
JAKE Silently.
JAKE a DRIPPING.
JAKE GLISTENING SHAPE rises un from the WATER
behind them.
Swaying like a COBRA ready to strike: Our people TURN...
the TUBE ALIEN snatches one of the Apaches, SWALLOWING HIM in its thorny snout!
The indian SCREAMS --
JAKE Lights a WHISKEY MOLOTOV, hurls it at the CREATURE: BOOM!
JAKE It KEENS, BURNING, SPITTING OUT the Apache.
JAKE ALERTED, the dozen aliens by the transport SWARM at our heroes!
NAT COLORADO C g_that shuttle.
Colorado readies his TOMAHAWK -- Jake meets his eyes:
JAKE Knew there was a good reason I didn't kill you.
NAT COLORADO Just thinkin' the same thing.
NAT COLORADO The men trade FATEFUL LOOKS...
NAT COLORADO then the Indians HURL MOLOTOVS at the charging horde: KAAA-BOOM!
NAT COLORADO Aliens TWIST and SCREAM -- The Apaches STRIKE FEARLESSLY -- but the aliens quickly RECOVER and SHAKE THEM OFF, tearing most of them to SHREDS.
NAT COLORADO The horses BREAK FREE and crash madly through the cavern -- And this is the DISTRACTION Jake and Ella need to make their run,
for the transport -- up the loading ramp:
Ella SLAMS a switch and the ramp DRAWS UP.
Jake FREEZES: COCOONS hang all around, filled with motionless HUMAN BEINGS.
ELLA Jake - -
She slaps open an ENGINEERING HATCH, drops down a LADDER.
He takes a last awful look and SLIDES down after her --
-- the ladder funnels into the COCKPIT.
Ella starts TAPPING the console and HOLO-DISPLAYS appear, Alien text, rotating graphics.
She slides into a SEAT --
ELLA Strap in.
ELLA dammit!!!
JAKE Into what?!?
JAKE Ella JAMS a lever forward and the shuttle RISES.
JAKE JAKE grabs WEBBING that must be some type of SEATBELT, feeling the
sensation of ELLQU as:
Ella pilots the ship UPWARD, thrusters belching a WAKE OF FIRE that SCORCHES cavern walls and INCINERATES 6 ALIENS!
As a HORSE streaks by, Colorado grabs a hunk of mane, LEAPS ON --
DOC comes RUNNING frantically:
Colorado PULLS Doc up onto the horse's bare back -- no easy task with Doc's 300 POUNDS.
The remaining Apaches (5) commandeer horses and GALLOP HARD down the tunnel -- Two aliens jump on MANTA-SPEEDERS in pursuit!
Jake has NEVER moved this fast, BARELY avoiding walls as Ella expertly pilots the ship.
LEFT -- RIGHT -- SIDEWAYS -- up ahead, DIM LIGHT spills from a FISSURE leading above ground:
ELLA Hold on.
She cranks back and the ship PITCHES upward --
The shuttle BURSTS OUT into the canyon and skates the rim.
Jake fights the G-FORCES and teeth-rattling TURBULENCE as -- The craft keeps spiralling UP UP toward...
THE OMINOUS CLOUD.
As we come closer, an IMPOSSIBLY BLUE GLOW blinds us:
The shuttle BLASTS through the upper cloud layer, to reveal...
-SHIP.
ENORMOUS AND THREATENING, like a BLACK METAL CLAW.
Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye of a hurricane.
ON ELLA.
Like ice down her spine...
as we drift back to JAKE.
Trying to find a word to DESCRIBE this thing.
Finally:
JAKE Sheee-it.
The rest of our heroes GALLOP FAST out the criss-crossing tunnels -- KA-CHINNNG!
Apaches are CLAMPED WITH STEEL COLLARS and YANKED off their horses as the SPEEDERS roar in from behind!
Colorado VEERS toward a LIGHT as Doc ignites a molotov and they:
GALLOP Out into daylight, rigb-t_through the CENTER of the fort -- Doc THROWS his molotov and BOOM!!!
Aliens go FLYING, on fire!
Doc throws another MOLOTOV, clearing a path for Colorado to RIDE HARD for the fort's 30 FT.
STEEL ENTRY GATES...
which start SWINGING CLOSED to trap them!
But at the LAST SECOND, the horse SLIPS THROUGH the narrow opening as it THUNDERS CLOSED.
Now the aliens are pissed off:
They start spilling over the fort walls in pursuit.
A few mount SPEEDERS and launch as our guys ride DOWN THE CANYON TRENCH:
Colorado and Doc ZIG-ZAG around CURVES -- like mice navigatinga maze, so the speeders can't get a clear shot:
DOC They're gaining on us!
NAT COLORADO That's the point!
NAT COLORADO And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS...
NAT COLORADO BOOM!
NAT COLORADO An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN from above -- WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade CATAPULTS.
NAT COLORADO BOOM!
NAT COLORADO BOOM!
NAT COLORADO Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING!
NAT COLORADO A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH!
NAT COLORADO An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking WHISKEY RAGS and wrapping arrows.
NAT COLORADO Among them, EMMETT and HAPPY!
NAT COLORADO The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT -- IGNITES it -- lets it FLY -- WHOOSH!
NAT COLORADO It SKEWERS a speeder pilot who BURSTS INTO
FLAMES, the speeder CORKSCREWS into another one, both EXPLODING:
Caught OFF-GUARD with NO WM TO TURN AROUND as from the OPPOSITE END of the canyon, a BELLOWING WAR WHOOP:
CRASH!
The Apaches HURTLE into the flank of aliens.
LASERS are met with the CRACK of RIFLES and hatchets --
The Apache leader spurs his horse onward, leading men toward the alien bunker.
An EXPLOSION CONSUMES FRAME, becoming the:
-- PLASMA FIRE of the shuttle's burners as it ROARS toward the ALIEN SHIP...
a SPECK against the BEHEMOTH:
INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The shuttle sweeps past the command center's polarized window, where...
INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS THE SLAVER watches with EVIL EYES.
INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS He's on the UPPER LEVEL of a TWO-TIER COMMAND CENTER.
INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS A DOZEN ALIENS operate holo-consoles.
INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Readying the ship to leave.
Ella settles down on a GLOWING DOCKING COLLAR.
With the two ships CONNECTED, the DISPLAY flashes a DEPARTURE ALERT:
-- Dammit --- -- what--?
-- she's CLIMBING back up the ladder, he FOLLOWS:
They quickly CLIMB up the LADDER TUBE --
ELLA Engines are warming up -- got eight minutes til the ship leaves, and about one til automated retrieval --
JAKE -- autojamated what --?
As they spill into the LOADING BAY, a CLANG reverberates: THE AIRLOCK DOOR -- AT THEIRFEyT The first EXPLOSIVE BOLT shoots off.
Ella jams her SHOTGUN into a sheath on her back, presses herself flat:
ELLA Hug the wall.
ELLA Jake does that beside her as the next bolt PINGS out --
ELLA (CONT'D) When they come at us, aim for their heads.
ELLA (CONT'D) Only way to kill 'em for sure.
He looks at his bracelet, adrenaline SURGING -- it ACTIVATES:
JAKE I'll aim just fine.
THE LAST BOLT FIRES and the airlock door SHOOTS OFF:
JAKE (CONT'D) SonofaBITCH!
JAKE (CONT'D) The manipulator arms SCOOP UP COCOONS, pulling them DOWN the
She JUMPS through the airlock -- Jake has no time to think:
And JUMPS after her --
-- LANDING beside Ella.
Starts to pick himself up...
but what he sees ASSAULTS HIS MIND.
We RISE UP UP UP, Ella and Jake growing SMALLER in what we now reveal is a MASSIVE HANGAR where: AUTOMATED -ARMS PLANT RECENT ARRIVALS INTO A VERITABLE FOREST of PEOPLE AND ANIMALS.
Level after level, THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF COCOONS are suspended from branch-like limbs.
Jake picks himself up, looking around the massive hangar in AWE.
-- she PULLS HIM into an alcove as a machine arm SWINGS overhead, flashing a WIDE CONICAL LASER that inventories cocoons like the machine in the underground cave.
As they CROUCH:
ELLA (CONT'D) We can't let that thing see us or they'll know we're here.
ELLA (CONT'D) She turns -- hits buttons on a console -- a door SLIDES UP leading to a series of CORRIDORS.
ELLA (CONT'D) She starts to MOVE --
ELLA (CONT'D) This'll take us to the bridge -- But Jake doesn't follow.
ELLA (CONT'D) STARES at her --
JAKE Slaver's up there--?
ELLA I sure as hell hope not.
JAKE Then I'm not goin' with you.
JAKE And now she HARDENS --
ELLA You got any idea how big this ship is?
ELLA No ray you'll ever find him alone.
ELLA Be like findin' a needle in a-- -- SLAM!!
ELLA Jake interrupts her by aiming at the LASER SCANNER and FIRING HIS BLASTER, blowing it apart.
ELLA The scanner eye CRASHES to the floor, flaming.
ELLA A KLAXON rings --
JAKE I ain't gonna find him.
JAKE He's gonna find me.
ELLA Thanks for the head start.
ELLA She turns and RUNS.
ELLA Jake moves to that scanner eye on the
floor, walks right up to it and STARES into the shattered IRIS:
JAKE Alright, you sonofabitch...
JAKE come and get me.
INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS JAKE'S FACE APPEARS AS A THERMAL HEAT SOURCE -- fritzing as he stares into the scanner.
INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS ALARMS scream.
INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS THE SLAVER fills with RAGE.
INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS And RECOGNITION.
INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Aliens begin grabbing WEAPONS but The Slaver SHRIEKS for them to
STOP.
We don't need to speak alien to understand: "He's mine.
Jake has moved out into the corridors -- blaster ready -- eyes darting -- suddenly -- WHAM: A STEEL BARRICADE SLAMS DOWN BEHIND HIM.
WHAM!
Another in front -- WHAM!
He's TRAPPED, shut off from the passageways...
..
except ONE.
A long, dark tunnel.
A DOOR at the far end HISSES open: THE TURBOLIFT ELEVATOR.
ON JAKE.
Understanding...
his call is bging answe
Okay.
And starts walking to the elevator...
as a SCREAM takes us to:
Handmade LADDERS are SWUNG FORWARD onto the fort as Apaches try to SCALE the wall, but are BLOWN BACK by ALIEN PARAPET SENTRIES.
ON DOC -- running TRIAGE on wounded warriors:
DOC I need more bandages now!/ You: lint and splint that leg!
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) We're losing ranks !
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) And then, out of nowhere...
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) the BANG BANG BANG of 30 pistols fills the air as -- DOLARHYDE RIDES IN WITH JAKE'S GANG!
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) A renewed SURGE of energy
as cowboys join Indians to fortify their ranks:
NAT COLORADO You came back!
DOLARHYDE Told you: I take care of my kin.
DOLARHYDE Colorado knows that's as close to "I love you" as he'll ever
get.
But the UPSWING is short-lived as: A speeder WHIZZES past, dropping a METALLIC BUNDLE.
It splits open right in front of the fort's STEEL GATES -- pieces hydraulically ASSEMBLING THEMSELVES in seconds, becoming: THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPERGUN_OF DEATH.
TWO LETHAL BARRELS spin to life, firing STRANGE STEEL BALL BEARINGS in every direction.
CLAW HOOKS snap out of the balls, EMBEDDING in soldiers!
One LODGES in a GANG MEMBER beside DOC -- he FLAILS:
A RED SPRING-LOADED PIN depresses in the ball's center: KA-BOOM!
GRENADE!
Doc goes FLYING from the kickback, landing near: GREY WOLF -- FWWWWTWHCK!!!
Another claw-ball CLAMPS into the Apache's SHOULDER -- he SHOUTS, struggles to pull it out --
The RED PIN starts to depress -- pOC LUNGES, JAMS HIS FINGER RETJff&H_THE PIN AND BLASTING CAP.
Now he's stopped it from exploding, but if he pulls his finger out...
HE DIES TOO.
DOC and GREY WOLF lock eyes.
Their fates suddenly ENTWINED as --
Bars of light move rhythmically across Jake's face -- BURNING with determination -- as he travels up in the turbolift.
It slows to a STOP.
The door cycles open and --
-- the STRANGEST THING happens.
DESERT SAND billows in a gust of ventilated air.
SAND?!
Jake emerges, blocking his eyes:
-- the sand swirls and eddies.
Visibility reduced to ZERO.
As Jake pushes through, the air clears a little...
His eyes WIDEN.
Trying to make SENSE of what he sees: Remember all those BUILDINGS that were pulled up into the tornado when Absolution was attacked?
And that CRATER they found that used to be "Winfield's Landing"?
It-'-s all-HE in a junkwle hangar.
Building pieces.
False front facades.
Debris piled on top of each other, TILTED AND TWISTED AT FUNHOUSE ANGLES.
And the desert sand that was sucked up along with it all.
A GLOWING REACTOR casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage.
Weapon ready, Jake moves past part of A BROTHEL.
Jutting fragments of a HORSE CORRAL.
A CREAKING SALOON SIGN swings like a pendulum, CLANKS EERILY.
A STEAM PIPE EXPLODES STEAM.
Jake WHIRLS -- and like demons...
5 ALIENS emerge.
Slowly.
Fanning out, taking positions as...
THE SLAVER steps out of the smoke, squarely facing Jake.
aAd_h@-- is holding ELLA hostage.
WRIST BLASTER pressed to her throat.
Jake and Ella LOCK EYES.
She's terrified, but staying STRONG.
His hand LINGERS at his hip, blaster ready.
JAKE Drop the woman.
JAKE We both know this ain't about her.
JAKE But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck.
JAKE Almost GRINNING.
JAKE And Jake MEETS the look --
JAKE (CONT'D) She says you're as bad as they come.
Jake curls back the fingers on both hands, CRACKING knuckles:
JAKE (CONT'D) Well, you ugly sonofabitch...
JAKE (CONT'D) they say the same about me.
JAKE (CONT'D) A pipe SPEWS STEAM -- UNNERVINGLY LOUD.
JAKE (CONT'D) Then STOPS.
JAKE (CONT'D) Could'a had your boys kill me five times over, instead you rolled out the red carpet...
JAKE (CONT'D) so let's get it over with.
The Slaver HISSES ANGRILY at the challenge.
PUSHES Ella roughly off to one of his GANG, who keeps a blaster pressed to her side.
Vow ' O right the a ter of the "town" junkpile.
THE SLAVER -- his hand at his side, twitching.
JAKE -- his hand is still.
Everyone DRAWS!
But Jake's INSANELY FAST as he drops to a knee and FIRES gunsmoke-style -- BLAM SLAM!
The Slaver's HIT and -- ELLA -- WRENCHES her captor's arm backward and he fires USELESS ROUNDS into the air -- she takes a HIT in the leg as Jake SHOOTS the captor with a SHOT to the temple -- Jake GRABS and PULLS Ella to safety behind a SHREDDED STORE FRONT, taking cover -- lasers PUNCHING through the building walls -- Ella spots an ALIEN lunging around a corner:
Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!!
The creature FLIES off its feet.
JAKE Stay down.
JAKE Ella does, and here come the rest of the aliens as Jake GUNS
The REACTOR is hit in the crossfire and the ship RESPONDS with a turbine HOWL.
Corpses litter the floor...
all except for The Slaver.
A trail of FLUORESCENT BLOOD leads around the corner...
Jake WHIRLS to Ella -- her leg wounded --
JAKE (CONT'D) -- you alright?
In PAIN, she snatches one of those SMART DISCS off a dead alien:
ELLA Reactor's hit.
ELLA if I don't get this ship on the ground soon, we're all dead...
ELLA Get me over to that turbolift.
ELLA He slings an arm around her shoulder and LIFTS her, helping her to the elevator --
ELLA (CONT'D) Put me inside.
He does.
She sees his eyes go back to The Slaver's BLOOD TRAIL:
ELLA (CONT'D) I can manage the rest without you.
ELLA (CONT'D) (tough...
ELLA (CONT'D) but with
Go do what you came up here to do.
He looks at her.
At the blood.
At the unstable REACTOR.
And Jake Lonergan makes a CHOICE:
JAKE Goddamnit.
JAKE -- he gets INTO THE ELEVATOR with her.
JAKE She SLAMS the control pad, doors CLOSE -- they start rocketing upward.
JAKE She half-grins as her eyes hold on him.
JAKE And within them...
JAKE trust.
JAKE AND FAITH.
JAKE (CONT'D) Stop smiling.
As the FORT SIEGE continues, DOLARHYDE and COLORADO gallop back and forth between their men:
-- KATHWAM!
An EXPLOSION throws them off their horses.
Colorado picks up his father and they start RUNNING LOW under stray beams of PLASMA FIRE, reaching Doc and Grey Wolf:
Doc's finger is still STUCK in that ALIEN GRENADE, clamped to the bleeding Apache's shoulder:
The hell iz that?
Grey Wolf MOANS in pain.
Doc SHOUTS to Dolar:
DOC Tell him to hold still!
DOC If I have this thing figured right, long as t keep my finger under the red pin we won't blow up!
What's he saying?:
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) He says we're all gonna die.
COLORADO We need to pull it out of his shoulder!
DOLARHYDE I'm not pullin' anything!
He's the damn doctor!
ZZZZZZAM!
MORE people are CUT DOWN by the Alien GRENADE CANNON -- the BLOWBACK nearly KNOCKS the grenade out of Doe's hand --
Dolarhyde gets an IDEA.
HARDENS.
Looks Doc right in the eye:
DOLARHYDE Alright, listen -- you slide your finger from under that pin, I'll slip mine in and hold it in place.
DOLARHYDE Then you pull it out and I'll throw it.
DOLARHYDE Doc NODS fearfully.
DOLARHYDE Dolar carefully SLIPS his finger under the pin as Doc SLIPS it out.
DOLARHYDE PHEW.
DOLARHYDE Now Doc takes hold of the grenade itself, nods "ready" to pull it out.
DOLARHYDE Grey Wolf braces
DOC On three...
One...
t --
DOLARHYDE -- Wait.
Everyone LURCHES from the tension interrupt:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Tell your wife we're clear.
DOC What?
DOLARHYDE -- your wife.
DOLARHYDE Maria.
DOLARHYDE We had an arrangement.
DOLARHYDE I left your saloon alone and she paid me off.
DOLARHYDE ON DOC.
DOLARHYDE Reeling, now REALLY confused --
DOC We're broke.
DOC Paid you off with what?
DOLARHYDE She stole from the people in your morgue.
DOLARHYDE Gold teeth, trinkets, pocket watches -- It LANDS on Doc: that's why he fond the watch under their bed.
DOC I thought she was cheating!
DOLARHYDE Just robbin' corpses.
DOC Thank God!
DOC Wait.
DOC You hate me.
DOC Why're you telling me this?
With GENUINE REMORSE:
DOLARHYDE May not get another chance --
-- and I still hate ya.
A MOMENT.
Forgiveness and atonement.
One...
two...
three!
And Doc RIPS the grenade from Grey Wolf's shoulder -- he HOWLS, CLAMPS tearing out of his flesh.
But they did it!
As more EXPLOSIONS decimate men, Dolarhyde PULLS the grenade out of Doc's hands, still holding his finger under the FIRING PIN --
Dolarhyde looks at Colorado:
DOLARHYDE Tell your mother I love her.
DOLARHYDE With that, he CHARGES into the swirling chaos
-- but BOOM!
Colorado's FORCED BACK by an explosion -- through the debris, he sees his father running toward...
Dolarhyde HURLS the grenade -- BOOM!!!
IT DETONATES IN A
But his sacrifice 7M S THE TIDE!
THE EXPLOSION BLOWS THE
A CRY OF VICTORY as the humans STORM THROUGH!
Aliens hurtle back in DISORDER --
INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The small ALIEN BRIDGE CREW scrambles to control the damaged ship.
INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The WHIR of the lift arriving, doors OPEN and -- WHOOSH!
INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The SMART WEAPON blurs out of the elevator, SLICING HALF A DOZEN ALIENS IN HALF -- circles back around to ELLA, who skillfully catches it as she RUN/LIMPS from the lift with JAKE -- LASER FIRE IGNITES THE BRIDGE as he makes QUICK WORK of the rest and Ella mans a console, getting to work --
ELLA We're going down fast.
ELLA She calls up telemetry on a HOLO-WINDOW: EARTH TERRAIN -- The
BATTLEFIELD.
Sets coordinates, vectoring the ship that way: A WHIR as a SECOND TURBOLIFT arrives...
AND THE SLAVER STEPS QQT.
Wounded, and very PISSED OFF.
Jake says to Ella:
JAKE No matter what.
JAKE Jake and The Slaver HURTLE into each other, TUMBLE off a catwalk, CRASHING into conduits and GUNKY WATER below.
JAKE Jake staggers up but The Slaver is HUGE -- SLAMS Jake back into the water.
JAKE PINS A FOOT on his blaster arm -- CRUSHING IT.
JAKE Jake HOWLS as The Slaver presses a series of those HIEROGLYPH MARKINGS on Jake's BRACELET -- the symbols LIGHT UP in an UNLOCK CODE -- and KA-CHING!
JAKE The bracelet POPS OF.E.
JAKE The Slaver TOSSES IT into the gunky water.
JAKE Draws his LASER WHIP -- WHUP-SNAP!
JAKE The white-hot tip LASHES JAKE'S BACK, ripping his shirt and BURN-SCARRING HIS BACK!
JAKE Jake SCREAMS in agony as The Slaver WHIPS HIM MERCILESSLY --
The Scout Ship SCREAMS down out of the cloud, toward the CANYON:
Outlaws and Apaches finish off the wounded, TOMAHAWKS RIPPING AWAY TENTACLED SCALPS!
Carnage and joy -- but then: A MONSTROUS SHADOW spreads over the battlefield.
Everyone looks up to see the SCOUT SHIP PLUMMETING DOWN --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Fall back!!!
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) NOW!!
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) NOW!!
Another LASER WHIP SNAP and Jake seems DONE.
Now The Slaver LIFTS Jake from the water, CRUSHING his wind-pipe.
Jake FLAILS, REACHING for something BELOW FRAME...
finally GRABS and STABS it into The Slaver's side.
The Alien ROARS in pain and looks down to see --
JAKE Go to hell.
Jake DROPS, GASPING.
Revenge fulfilled.
Painfully starts CLIMBING a ladder back to the upper deck --
As the humans FLEE from the fort, the remaining aliens RETREAT to the last shuttles for ESCAPE...
start to LIFT OFF...
But find themselves SMASHING into the ENORMOUS HULL of the ship as_it crashe _down!
INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Jake FALLS into the seat beside Ella, straps in.
INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Fighting the controls, she SEES THE WHIP MARKS on his back.
INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS It TEARS her
heart open.
And because this might be the end...
she ADMITS:
ELLA I lied.
JAKE ...
JAKE I know.
ELLA No, I heard what you said when I was layin' there...
JAKE.
Taken aback.
LAID BARE.
As she says:
ELLA (CONT'D) You are a good man.
ELLA (CONT'D) At least...
ELLA (CONT'D) to me.
ELLA (CONT'D) The ground GROWS BIGGER out the window.
ELLA (CONT'D) Her HAND reaches over for his.
ELLA (CONT'D) JAKE'S HAND clasps hers and --
The frame is WHITE with dust and SUNSHINE.
As from the ether comes...
EMMETT, HAPPY, and DOC, with GREY WOLF's arm slung over his shoulder.
Among other faces, White and Apache...
all of them PROUD WARRIORS.
Staring in awe at:
Something starts to rain down.
Looks at first like glitter...
until we realize it's GOLD DUST.
From an OPENING in the Scout Ship, the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES as...
ALL THE ANIMALS STAMPEDE OUT.
Then, slowly...
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE emerge, dazed -- their minds slowly WAKING UP.
White and Kiowa-Apache ABDUCTEES.
DOC RUSHES IN, searching faces -- no -- no -- no -- n-- THERE she is, his BELOVED MARIA, stumbling weakly toward him as tears runs down her cheek.
He EMBRACES her madly, kissing every inch of her face as...
EMMETT pushes through the crowd, sees SHERIFF TAGGART --
The kid GRABS his father and holds him for dear life, as Taggart stares back in a daze --
EMMETT (CONT'D) It's me -- it's Emmett.
EMMETT (CONT'D) And somewhere in there, RECOGNITION comes to the Sheriff's eyes...
EMMETT (CONT'D) Emmett SMILES and throws his arms around his father again as --
Families, lovers, friends...
reunited.
COLORADO Moving through the FALLEN BODIES toward the lifeless form of Dolarhyde, his FATHER.
COLORADO Eyes welling, he drops to his knees...
Nat?
Colorado turns -- it's PERCY.
Confused.
Like waking from a dream.
Sees his father on the ground...
PERCY What...
PERCY happened?
PERCY And all Colorado can say is...
NAT COLORADO He's dead.
NAT COLORADO That HANGS there.
NAT COLORADO Percy blinks.
NAT COLORADO And then --
PERCY Who's gettin' the ranch?
PERCY ON COLORADO.
PERCY At first, words that don't compute.
PERCY Then PURE
BLIND RAGE takes hold and his FISTS FLY, PUNCHING PERCY:
HEY! Colorado WHIRLS -- DOLARHYDE IS STAGGERING TO HIS FEET, ALIVE!
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) No one's gettin' my ranch.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Stunned, Colorado GRINS.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Percy spits blood, points accusingly --
PERCY Paw, he--
Dolarhyde SMACKS Percy across the face:
PERCY (CONT'D) OW!!!
PERCY (CONT'D) What'd you do that for?
For being an ungrateful little bastard.
Now shake your brother's hand and thank him for saving your ass, cause it's more than you ever would'a done bjM.
Chastened, Percy glowers at Colorado.
Grudgingly reaches out a hand.
So does Nat.
As they SHAKE --
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) That's better.
JAKE Staggers through the crowd.
JAKE And sees ELLA.
JAKE Thgy did it.
JAKE But she still looks TROUBLED.
JAKE Staring out at the vast desert...
JAKE what is it?
ELLA We didn't get all of 'em.
ELLA Some ran oft.
ELLA That LANDS on Jake, as he too looks toward the endless horizon.
ELLA HOLD on them, together, a VICTORIOUS but UNRESOLVED note...
ELLA We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until Jake and Ella are just two small figures in the crowd...
A glorious sight: Absolution in REBIRTH -- FLUSH from all that GOLD.
Storefronts brightly painted, the streets ALIVE.
We PICK UP EMMETT running through the hustle and bustle with two APACHE KIDS.
Suddenly, DOLARHYDE, COLORADO and their gang ride in.
SHERIFF TAGGART emerges from his office with DEPUTY WADE:
EMMETT -- what?
EMMETT What'd I dQ?
Get outta the road before you're run down!
If your (overlapping) momma saw y-- -- "saw me playin' in the street she'd roll over in her grave and shoot lightnin' bolts outta her eyes," I know, I know!
He runs off.
Taggart SMIRKS:
SHERIFF TAGGART Kid's got a mouth on him.
DEPUTY WADE Well, Kyle, considering he saved your life, guess you'll just have to grin'n bear it.
Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever.
The men HOLD looks:
SHERIFF TAGGART Woodrow.
DOLARHYDE Kyle.
Percy STEWS about something.
Dolar WHACKS him upside the head:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Go_ _on.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER --
SHERIFF TAGGART What's this?
DOLARHYDE Claims to the land 50 miles west of here.
DOLARHYDE I've signed it over to the township of Absolution.
DOLARHYDE Considering I'm a businessman, I figure expansion's in both our interests.
DOLARHYDE Needs the Sheriff's signature to be official.
SHERIFF TAGGART Fifty miles west of here is where the goldmine is, Woodrow.
That so.
With surprise, Taggart studies the paper.
SMILES:
SHERIFF TAGGART What's this about twenty percent going to the Apaches?
SHERIFF TAGGART Dolarhyde glances at Colorado.
SHERIFF TAGGART A moment.
SHERIFF TAGGART But the hardened
rancher maintains his rock-solid facade:
DOLARHYDE Figure the only way not to piss 'em off is to buy 'em.
SHERIFF TAGGART Since when'd you worry about pissin' anyone off?
DOLARHYDE Just sign it, Goddamnit.
DOLARHYDE With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and
flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN:
SHERIFF TAGGART I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow, but I know you'd just be insulted.
DOLARHYDE Damn right.
DOLARHYDE Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of
being rebuilt in grand style -- and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where:
DOC AND MARIA burst through a door, tearing passionately at each other's CLOTHES -- Maria MOANS as Doc kisses her neck:
SHH!
The workers will hear us!!!
Let them hear!
As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES.
Reaches under his back to find...
a GOLD POCKETWATCH.
DOC What is this?
MARIA Look at the inscription.
MARIA He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON...
MARIA POR
SIEMPRE."
Doc looks up at her, MOVED.
Then -- PLAYFULLY:
DOC This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch...
MARIA Shut up and kiss me.
MARIA She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME --
A hand unties a HORSE from its tether bar -- it's JAKE.
Saddle bags packed.
A BARK turns him around...
HAPPY.
Yipping for Jake to FOLLOW.
He GRINS.
As MUSIC begins to RISE -- HOPEFUL:
EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY In a LONG SHOT -- the distant SILHOUETTES of Happy BOUNDING through the shallow TWIN RIVERS, Jake following on horseback...
As Jake approaches, APACHE SENTRIES emerge from rocks to keep outsiders away.
Jake TIPS his hat and they nod, let him pass.
He nears the bluff where ELLA, GREY WOLF, and the rest of the Apaches finish laying DYNAMITE DET CORD that trails down into the canyon.
Ella hears Happy BARKING -- turns to see her dog with Jake.
She smiles as he rides up, dismounts:
ELLA Second damn time that dog ran off on me.
JAKE Second time he brought me to you.
JAKE Happy's tail wags.
JAKE The look between Jake and Ella HOLDS.
JAKE And it seems freighted with everything.
JAKE Finally, he breaks it -- glancing at the Apaches finishing their work with the dynamite, and the remnants of the ALIEN SHIP and FORTRESS below.
JAKE (CONT'D) Looks like you got everything set.
JAKE (CONT'D) Ella eyes Jake's horse, loaded with GEAR.
JAKE (CONT'D) Looks up, clearly
ELLA Where you headed?
Got some messes to clean up.
But she looks at him.
fEADI.NG liim.
wryly:
ELLA Messes.
JAKE ...
JAKE Yep.
JAKE What.
She walks right up to his horse.
Right up to HIM:
ELLA I think you're ridin' off cause you're just scared of what'll happen if you stay.
ELLA An INFERENCE here.
ELLA Ella's going BOLD.
ELLA Jake swings off his
horse, lands beside her.
Now.
Almost CURIOUS:
JAKE And what's gonna happen?
She steps CLOSER to him...
INTIMATE:
ELLA You know.
ELLA A CHARGE between them.
ELLA All they wanna do is KISS...
ELLA But that'd be too easy.
ELLA And those wounds of his, they haven't
quite healed.
He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:
JAKE If I stay...
JAKE it's not gonna be good for anybody, Ella.
JAKE A beat.
JAKE She looks off.
JAKE Nods.
JAKE They say nothing.
JAKE And now he
slowly climbs back on his horse.
Ella TOUGHENS:
ELLA Heard some rumors outta Abilene.
ELLA Weird noises at night.
ELLA Cattle mutilations.
ELLA Weather phenomena.
ELLA Figured I'd ride down there.
ELLA Give it a look-see.
JAKE What's 'phenomena'?
ELLA Big storms in places that don't get big storms.
ELLA ON JAKE.
ELLA Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED,
though he plays it down:
JAKE You goin' down there yourself?
ELLA Why?
ELLA You worried about me?
ELLA You bet your ass he is.
ELLA But, he shakes his head--
JAKE No, ma'am.
JAKE You can take care of yourself just fine.
JAKE Be seein' you around.
ELLA goodbye, Jake.
ELLA He gets back on his horse.
ELLA Starts to ride off.
ELLA Happy BARKS and trots alongside him.
ELLA BARK BARK BARK.
ELLA In dog that means "Don't be an idiot."
ELLA Jake glances over --
JAKE Get the hell away from me, you damn mutt.
Go on, GET.
He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE.
Jake rides off into the sunset.
But his heart's KICKING in his chest.
And this is pretty much where things usually end...
But.
Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS.
Turns the horse around.
TROTS back to Ella, whose smile WIDENS as he closes the gap between them.
Finally STOPS right in front of her.
And despite his best effort to stay TOUGH...
he just plain likes her:
JAKE (CONT'D) Abilene happens to be on my way.
JAKE (CONT'D) He reaches out a hand...
JAKE (CONT'D) she takes it...
JAKE (CONT'D) as he PULLS HER UP INTO THE SADDLE.
JAKE (CONT'D) Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms
around his waist.
Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:
JAKE (CONT'D) Stop smiling, Goddammit.
JAKE (CONT'D) He KICKS the horse and Happy follows.
JAKE (CONT'D) Ella shoots a goodbye
look to Grey Wolf, who NODS.
Signals his men and FUSES ARE LIT: The DYNAMITE FUSES ssssssnake down the mountain -- reaching the canyon floor -- INTO those limestone tunnels where CLUSTERS OF DYNAMITE have been placed...
and as FUSE MEETS EXPLOSIVE: ANGLE - JAKE AND ELLA CRESTING A HILL -- B000000000000MI The THUNDER of EXPLOSIONS makes them rear.
They turn back to see...
Ella folds her arms TIGHTER around Jake, her heart full.
With a nod of private affirmation, he spurs the horse with a HYAI As the canyon behind them fills with rushing water, Jake and Ella ride hard into the fiery sunset...
Away from the past, toward a future full of promise.
