KNOCKED UP
Written by
Judd Apatow
BEN STONE, 23, cute in a chunky Jewish guy sort of way, boxes one of his roommates, MARTIN.
His other roommates, JAY and JASON fight with broom sticks.
JONAH drinks beer on the couch spectating.
We see Ben and Jay fighting.
At one point they fight with gloves which are on fire, balancing on a plank over a dirty pool.
Ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head.
There is a smoking joint in his mouth, making the bowl get cloudier and cloudier.
He starts coughing hysterically and takes it off.
A boom box is playing.
The boys are now free style rapping.
It is terrible but they are having a blast.
Pot is being smoked.
Beer is around.
Ben and roommates ride a terrifying rollercoaster.
ALISON SCOTT, pretty, 24, wakes up to her radio alarm.
Allison's sister, DEBBIE, sleeps on the floors of the bedroom, while her husband, PETE, sleeps on the bed with their eight-year- old daughter SADIE.
CHARLOTTE, age three, jumps on the bed.
CHARLOTTE Sadie, wake up.
SADIE Oh my gosh.
CHARLOTTE Daddy, wake up.
Charlotte hits Pete.
PETE Okay, I'm up.
She exits a guest house and walks to the main house dressed for work.
Debbie, is making breakfast for Charlotte and Sadie.
Pete enters the kitchen.
DEBBIE I need you to take the kids to school this morning.
PETE Oh, I would, but I'm supposed to work out.
DEBBIE What?
PETE I got an appointment with a trainer.
PETE I can't cancel now, he'll charge me.
DEBBIE Well, you didn't tell me.
PETE Yeah I did.
PETE Last week, I told you.
DEBBIE You didn't tell me.
PETE I did.
PETE And then I wrote it on the calendar like you told me to.
DEBBIE No, you didn't tell me.
PETE I did tell you.
DEBBIE Well, you didn't, but what are we going to do?
DEBBIE Because I have an appointment so you're taking the kids to school.
Pete holds Charlotte in front of him.
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Don't use the baby to cover your tracks.
ALISON I can drive them.
ALISON I'll drive them to school.
PETE Thank you very much.
DEBBIE Great.
DEBBIE Good.
DEBBIE You turned my sister into a limo driver.
ALISON I don't mind.
PETE It all worked out!
Alison drives the kids to school.
Charlotte and Sadie sit in the back.
Charlotte GIGGLES.
ALISON What are you giggling about?
SADIE Be quiet.
SADIE You're starting to annoy me.
CHARLOTTE Poo poo.
ALISON Ladies.
ALISON Nice.
SADIE You know what I did the other day?
ALISON What?
SADIE I Googled "murder."
ALISON You Googled "murder?"
SADIE Yeah.
ALISON Why?
ALISON I mean what did it say?
SADIE It didn't say anything.
SADIE It just showed pictures of people lying dead on the floor and...blood everywhere and ugh...
ALISON That was just ketchup.
ALISON Who wants to hear some music?
SADIE I want to hear "Rent."
CHARLOTTE I want to hear Green Day!
SADIE No, we're listening to "Rent."
CHARLOTTE Well, I want to listen to Green Day.
Sadies takes Charlotte's doll.
SADIE Well, I got your baby!
Charlotte WHINES.
ALISON Don't taunt her.
ALISON Come on.
SADIE Here.
Sadie shoves the doll at Charlotte.
ALISON Sadie!
CHARLOTTE Ow!
ALISON Why did you just do that?
ALISON Don't throw things at your sister!
CHARLOTTE She hit me.
ALISON Did you hit her?
SADIE I did not.
ALISON Make her happy.
ALISON It's okay.
SADIE It won't make her happy.
SADIE She spilled all the marbles on the floor.
ALISON Well, give her her marbles back.
In a living room of the house the guys have created an office for their web site.
There are a few large tables, several computers which they work at, and a few TV sets which have movies running on them.
Ben and his friends are holding a meeting.
They each have a note pad and pen, and Jonah is on a computer.
They smoke a joint and drink beers.
JASON All right?
JASON Now, are you sure you understand the terms of the bet?
JASON `Cause this is serious.
MARTIN Oh, no.
Martin, listen.
You don't shave your beard or cut your hair for one year, and if you can do that, I will pay your rent.
But if you shave, then you have to pay all five of our rents.
Thanks for the free money, bitch.
Hey, Martin, was it weird when you joined the Taliban, being American and everything like that?
Like when you see a woman driving a car, do you just get pissed?
Just watch your back, Serpico.
You never know who your friends are.
You guy can't make fun of the me the whole time.
But, Martin, it's a competition.
It's called "The Dirty Man Competition."
We're gonna make fun of you until you shave the beard.
That's the rules.
That's the whole point.
You're supposed to be tempted into shaving.
Your face looks like Robin Williams' knuckles.
You guys aren't allowed to make fun of me.
It's not part of the rules.
Martin, why didn't you just listen to me when I was explaining the rules?
You just looked at me with that blank stare of yours.
It was like talking to a wax statue.
Okay, guys, are you ready?
So...
"Only at `Flesh of the Stars.com' will customers be able to find exactly how long into what movies their favorite stars are exposed."
Nice.
Oh, fuckin' booya.
Pretty good, right?
JONAH Yeah.
JASON Yeah, ka-ching.
JASON Ka-ching.
JASON Ka-ching.
JONAH Guys, let's start loggin', all right?
JONAH Charles Manson?
JONAH Do you have any other thoughts?
MARTIN Good, awesome, let's start this off with a bang.
MARTIN Jamie Lee Curtis.
MARTIN I got an hour and ten minutes in "Trading Places."
MARTIN Uh, both chesticles.
JAY Ah, I got something.
JAY A three-titted alien from "Total Recall?"
JONAH Aw, she's not famous.
JASON "Damn it, Cohaagen, give the people the air."
RYAN SEACREST stands in front of a series of cameras.
Alison stands behind with a clipboard and headset.
RYAN SEACREST So if you want that perfect tan like the stars, he's the one to see.
RYAN SEACREST We'll be right back on "E!
RYAN SEACREST News."
RYAN SEACREST Stay with us.
ALISON Okay.
RYAN SEACREST Okay, is Jessica Simpson here yet?
ALISON Let me check.
RYAN SEACREST Is she on her way?
ALISON Hey, guys?
RYAN SEACREST She's left her house?
ALISON Okay, let me know when she's pulling in.
She's about to pull in.
Is she camera-ready?
Is she camera-ready?
If she's going to be in hair and makeup for three hours.
I can't do it.
I'm not going to be here.
I got to do "American Idol."
It's live.
I got to do it.
I got to be there.
What are we going to interview her about?
Nothing personal.
No personal questions.
No personal questions.
Don't ask her about her sister and her nose job.
No plastic surgery questions.
She doesn't want to talk about her boobs or her father's comments about her boobs.
Great.
We'll talk about the Middle East and maybe an idea of an exit strategy.
Maybe she has a good pitch.
Should I ask her about Korea?
Maybe have her point it out to us on a globe?
I don't understand the young talent in this town!
It doesn't make any sense.
I got four jobs.
Hell, I'm more famous than half the people we talk to anyway!
No one stands up.
No one has the balls to sit them down and say, "Look, just cut the shit."
But everybody works for `em.
They're all on the payroll.
They're all sucking the teat!
Nobody sits `em down, eye-to- eye, one-on-one, and says...
"Cut the shit."
And all these stars just to fuck it up.
That's what they do.
They fuck my day up!
And it pisses me off!
And now I'm sweating.
You know what?
You want us to just come and get you when she gets here?
You want to head to the green room for a minute?
Just chill out?
That's a good idea.
ALISON Want us to bring you anything?
ALISON You want some water?
RYAN SEACREST No.
ALISON You want a cookie?
RYAN SEACREST Cookie, yeah, cookie.
RYAN SEACREST Thanks.
ALISON Okay, we'll get you a cookie.
RYAN SEACREST I'm sorry I'm pissy.
JILL, one of the E!
executives, approaches Alison.
JILL Alison?
ALISON Yeah?
JILL Jack and I need to see you in his office.
Allison's boss, JACK, early forties, is at his desk.
Alison and Jill sit in the office.
JACK Thanks for coming in, Alison.
JACK Well, we wanted to talk to you today because we had a little debate on the conference call with New York about you.
ALISON You were talking about me?
JACK We were wondering aloud to one another whether or not you would be good for on-camera.
ALISON What'd you decide?
JILL They decided that they like you.
JILL And they would like to put you on camera.
ALISON Really?
JILL I know.
JILL I was so surprised, too.
Oh, my God.
This is the best news ever.
Thank you so much.
This is great!
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'll take that smile as a "Yes, I'll do it."
Absolutely.
I'm so excited.
Oh, my God.
It's a lot of work.
Can't wait to see what happens.
It's going to be tough.
Tough job.
About the work, most immediately, there's going to be some things that you're going to be able to get that other people in the office don't get.
One of them: Gym membership.
You want me to lose weight?
I don't want you to lose weight.
We can't legally ask you to do that.
We didn't say lose weight.
No.
I might say "tighten."
"Tight."
A little...tighter?
Just like toned and smaller.
Don't make everything smaller.
I don't want to generalize that way.
Tighter.
We don't want you to lose weight.
We just want you to be healthy.
ALISON Okay.
JILL You know, by, by eating less.
JILL We would just like it if you...go home and step on the scale and write down how much you weigh and subtract it by, like, twenty.
ALISON Twenty.
JILL And then weigh that much.
JACK Just remember, you've got it here, you've got it here, and everybody's going see you right there.
Debbie and Alison hug.
Pete is on the couch wearing headphones.
DEBBIE Yay!
DEBBIE That's so exciting!
ALISON Yay!
DEBBIE Oh my god!
DEBBIE Hey!
PETE Huh?
ALISON I got a promotion.
PETE Oh, congratulations!
ALISON Thank you.
PETE Hey, maybe you can get your own place now.
ALISON Oh, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
ALISON Yay!
DEBBIE Let's go celebrate.
ALISON Okay, let's do it.
DEBBIE Pete'll watch the kids?
PETE Yeah!
PETE We can watch "Taxicab Confessions."
DEBBIE What are you going to do?
ALISON I don't know!
Debbie and Alison SHRIEK.
DEBBIE I'm so excited.
ALISON Yay!
Alison and Debbie drive to a nightclub.
DEBBIE I walked in on him masturbating one night.
ALISON Ooh!
ALISON Did you get the deer-in-the- headlights look?
ALISON Did he freeze or did he finish?
DEBBIE No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't doing anything under the covers.
ALISON Oh, no!
DEBBIE I buy these nice towels and he whacks off into them.
ALISON "Deb and Pete forever"
DEBBIE And once he does that into them once, they're never soft ever again.
Alison and Debbie are walking over.
DEBBIE I can always tell if I'm looking good based on whether or not we get in.
They reach the front.
The Bouncer looks at them and waves them in.
BOUNCER Ladies?
ALISON Guess we're looking good.
DEBBIE If I didn't get in, I would have lost my shit.
Ben and the guys are standing at the head of the line.
BEN What's going on man?
BEN How long you gonna make us wait out here, for Christ's sake?
JAY Come on!
JAY What the fuck!
Ben sits with his friends, Jason, Jonah, Jay, and Martin.
BEN You know what movie I just saw again the other day which is fucking, like, mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it since it came out?
BEN "Munich."
JAY "Munich!"
JONAH Dude, "Munich" fuckin' rules.
JAY "Munich" is awesome!
BEN That movie was Eric Bana kicking fuckin' ass!
They all agree.
BEN (CONT'D) Dude, every movie with Jews, we're the ones getting killed.
BEN (CONT'D) "Munich" flips it on its ear.
BEN (CONT'D) We cappin' motherfuckers.
JONAH Not only killing, but fuckin', like, takin' names.
BEN If any of us get laid tonight, it's because of Eric Bana in "Munich."
JONAH I agree with that.
JAY I agree.
BEN You know what is not helping us get laid?
BEN Is the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, over here at our table.
BEN I like your shoes.
JONAH How was "Burning Man" this year?
BEN Fuck you guys, I'm glad I'm not Jewish.
BEN (CONT'D) So are we.
MARTIN Fine.
MARTIN Screw it.
BEN You weren't "chosen" for a reason.
JAY Yeah.
JAY Ahh!
JASON Ohh!!!
Meanwhile, Debbie and Alison head for the bar.
DEBBIE It's like everyone in here is twelve years old.
Debbie SIGHS.
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Am I too old to be here?
ALISON What?
DEBBIE Am I too old to be here?
ALISON No, of course not.
DEBBIE Does it look weird that I'm here?
ALISON No, not at all.
DEBBIE Am I hotter than these little bitches?
ALISON Yes!
ALISON You look amazing.
DEBBIE Guys in here would fuck me, right?
ALISON Yes.
DEBBIE That's weird to say, but, it makes me feel better.
ALISON You look hot.
DEBBIE I believe you.
ALISON I'm getting us drinks.
Alison leaves for the bar.
Ben is already at the bar attempting to get the BARTENDER's attention.
BEN Yo, a beer over here, please?
BEN You're gonna be embarrassed when you realize I'm Wilmer Valderrama.
BEN God.
ALISON Oh, Hey!
ALISON Excuse me!
BEN He's literally ignoring this entire half of the bar.
BEN Don't even bother.
ALISON Yeah, awesome.
BEN A beer over here, please?
BEN He looked at us!
BEN Did you see that?
ALISON Yeah, that was rough.
BEN And if you can't get service, what am I gonna do, you know?
ALISON Great.
ALISON It's going to be that night.
BEN Okay, you want a beer?
ALISON Yeah.
BEN Just observe.
Ben leans over the bar and picks up two bottles of beer and drops money on the bar.
BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) There you go.
BARTENDER Come on, man!
BEN Here you go!
BEN For your trouble!
BEN Thank you.
Ben hands one beer to Alison BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
BEN There you go.
ALISON Thank you.
BEN Okay, enjoy it.
ALISON Are you sure?
BEN I'm sure.
BEN I tried that once before at The Comedy Store and I got punched in the ear.
ALISON Thanks a lot, Oh, fuck, fuck!
ALISON I'm supposed to get one for my sister.
BEN Oh, here, take mine.
Ben hands Alison his beer.
ALISON No, that's okay.
ALISON I'll wait.
ALISON I'll, he'll get me--

BEN This is a big moment for me.
BEN Just take it.
ALISON Thank you.
ALISON Awesome.

BEN Okay, enjoy, be nice to them.
ALISON Bye.
ALISON Thanks again.
Alison leaves the bar to rejoin Debbie.

BEN No, I won't, `cause I'm a pussy.
Ben rejoins his friends.
JASON What's up, daddy?
BEN That girl.
BEN She, she totally gave me an opening, man, and I locked up.
BEN I just want to get shit-faced, though, you know?
BEN I'll just jerk it later.
BEN It's cool.
JASON Are you fuckin' crazy, man?
JASON She looks...smart.
JASON Who's that she's sitting with?

Ben and Jason head toward Alison and Debbie.
JASON Hey, which one's the sister?
Jonah approaches Martin.
JONAH Hey, Crockett.
JONAH You still partyin' with Tubbs these days?
MARTIN Come on, man.
MARTIN I'm getting it from all angles here.
MARTIN I don't like it anymore.
JONAH I know, I don't either.
JONAH Was it weird when you changed your name from Cat Stevens to Yusuf Islam?
MARTIN Yeah, it was really awkward.
JONAH All right, man.
JONAH I got to take off.
JONAH See ya, "Scorsese on coke."
Jay GROWLS loudly.
MARTIN What's that?
JAY Chewbacca.
JAY It's, you know, it's Chewie.

Meanwhile, Ben and Jason get to Alison and Debbie's table.
BEN Hey.
ALISON Hey.

BEN Oh, hi, I'm Ben.
DEBBIE Hi, Ben?

JASON It's a shame.
JASON You're beautiful.
DEBBIE Thank you.
ALISON She has two kids, too.
DEBBIE Shut up!
ALISON What?
ALISON It's nothing to be ashamed of.
BEN You think that's gonna stop him from hitting on her?
BEN It's not, at all.
JASON I love kids.

JASON Yeah, absolutely.
Debbie's cell phone RINGS.
DEBBIE Excuse me.

DEBBIE Google it.
DEBBIE Okay.
DEBBIE All right, bye.
DEBBIE I got to go.
DEBBIE Sadie might have the chicken pox.
JASON I had the chicken pox three times.
JASON I have no immunity to it.
BEN We don't have the heart to tell him it's herpes.
JASON It's not herpes if it's everywhere.
DEBBIE Are you coming?
Alison and Ben exchange a strange look.
ALISON Um, uh, you know, I'm all dressed, so I'll just hang out.
DEBBIE Really?

ALISON No, no.
ALISON You know, the like, Entertainment News channel?
BEN Oh, E!
E! Ben and Alison dance, clearly pretty drunk now.
E! We see Ben's
friends in the background, also dancing.
Ben pretends to throw dice while dancing.
JONAH Dude, I think he's doing the dice thing too much.
JAY That's really all he's got.
JAY Alison and Ben take another shot.
JAY Alison runs her fingers through
Ben's hair.

They exit the club.
Alison and Ben stagger out of the club and head down the sidewalk.
BEN We should get a cab.
Ben grabs Alison and they kiss.
Ben and Alison stagger across Pete and Debbie's yard towards the guest house.
BEN This is a big yard!
ALISON Shh!
BEN Let's go swimming right now.
BEN Let's just do that.
ALISON No.
BEN I'm doin'-- Whoo!
Alison and Ben collapse on the bed and make out.
They take off their shirts.

They continue to make out.
ALISON Do you have a condom?
BEN I do.
ALISON Okay.
BEN It's in my pants.
BEN I have a condom.
ALISON Okay.

Ben struggles to put on the condom.
BEN (CONT'D) Come on.
ALISON Hurry up.
BEN Stupid fucker.
ALISON What are you doing?
BEN I almost got it.
BEN Just give me a second.
ALISON Oh, God, just do it already!

BEN (CONT'D) This is lasting forever.
ALISON Yeah, it's awesome.
BEN I just doubled my record time.
BEN I'm sorry I'm sweating on you.
ALISON Okay, just stop taking.
Establishing shot of the guest house in morning light.
Ben is SNORING, his ass fully exposed.
Alison is wide awake, clearly kept up by his unattractive snoring.
She stares at him, not sure how she feels about what happened last night.
She nudges him with her foot.
BEN Fuck off, Martin.
BEN I said, fuck off Martin.
Ben awakens and turns around.
ALISON Hi.
BEN Oh.
BEN Hey.
ALISON Hey.
Ben assesses the situation.
BEN I'm naked.
ALISON Yeah.
BEN Did we have sex?
ALISON Yes.
BEN Nice.
BEN What time is it?
ALISON Seven-thirty.
BEN Why the fuck are we awake?
BEN Let's go back to sleep.
ALISON I have to go to work.
BEN Really?
ALISON Do you need to get to work or anything?
BEN No work today.
BEN Do you want to get breakfast?
ALISON Okay.
Alison and Ben walk to their cars.
Suddenly Pete walks out of the house with the kids.
ALISON `Morning.
PETE Good morning Alison.
BEN I'm Ben.
BEN What's happenin', man?
PETE Ben.
BEN How's it goin'?
Pete shakes Ben's hand and smiles.
PETE Ah, to be young.
ALISON Stop it.
PETE You stop it.
ALISON See ya later.
BEN All righty.
PETE See ya later.
PETE Enjoy the day.
PETE Never do what they did.
CHARLOTTE I'm gonna do it.
PETE You are?
PETE Uh-oh.
PETE Someone's getting home- schooled.
Alison is in the booth.
Ben emerges from the bathroom.
BEN Whew.
BEN I just yacked, something nasty.
BEN I feel way better, though.
BEN I think that's the secret.
BEN You just gotta puke.
BEN Did you puke?
ALISON No.
You can.
I won't think it's gross or anything.
I'm fine.
Oh, okay.
I just need some coffee, so...
You know, the best thing for a hangover's weed.
Do you smoke?
Do you smoke weed?
Not really.
You don't?
No.
At all?
Mm-mm.
Like in the morning?
No, I just don't.
It's the best medicine.
`Cause it fixes everything.
Jonah broke his elbow once.
We just got high and, it still clicks, but, I mean, he's okay.
Right.
Yeah.
Last night was great...what I remember of it?
Right, yeah.
Yeah.
We had a great time.
Yeah.
So what do you do?
I work at E!
The television channel?
Uh-huh, remember?
Wow.
We had, we had this conversation last night.
I, I told you about my promotion and I was out celebrating it.
No?
I don't remember that at all.
I'm super excited about it.
I'm actually doing my first on-air interview today.
With who?
Matthew Fox.
Matthew Fox from "Lost?"
Yeah.
You know what's interesting about him?
What?
Nothing.
Will you tell him he's an asshole for me?
No.
Someone needs to.
Like who gives a shit?
I hope a lot of people actually because that's what my job entails, is making sure people care about what he has to say.
I'm interviewing him.
Maybe it's just me.
Maybe I just don't give a shit.
I'm just saying he deserves a beat down.
It's sort of embarrassing to ask at this point, but what do you do for work?
Me and my roommates have started...we're starting an Internet website.
Oh, cool, what is it?
I'll give you the virtual experience okay?
How's that?
You're at your computer.
Who's an actress you like?
Mary Tyler Moore?
No, that does not work at all.
Let's say you love Meg Ryan.
I do.
Great.
Who doesn't?
Let's say you like her so much, you want to know every movie where she shows her tits.
And not just that, but how long into that movie she shows her tits.
Come to our web page, exclusively, type in `Meg Ryan.' Bam!
`In the Cut,' thirty-eight minutes in, forty-eight minutes in, like an hour and ten minutes in.
She's like naked that whole fuckin' movie.
She does full-frontal in that movie.
Wow.
They should have called her Harry, not Sally.
Really.
I'll show it to you.
I'll show you Meg Ryan's bush.
Okay.
Cool.
I actually need to get going, so.
BEN Awesome.
BEN Can I get your number?
Alison is incredulous.
BEN (CONT'D) We had fun, right?
BEN (CONT'D) We should hook up again.
ALISON I'm gonna give you my card because that'll be the best way...
BEN If you want to contact me, I don't have a cell right now because of payment complications, but you can email me at the web page, I check it.
BEN It's Ben at flesh of the stars, one word, dot com.
Alison gets out of the booth.
Ben gets up too.
BEN (CONT'D) So, awesome.
ALISON All right then.
ALISON Nice to meet you.
Ben puts his arms out for a hug.
Alison complies.
Ben kisses the air.
ALISON (CONT'D) Take care.
BEN Okay, uh, see ya.
Alison exits the diner.
BEN (CONT'D) Bye!
BEN (CONT'D) That was fuckin' brutal.
BEN (CONT'D) Yeah, that was brutal.
Alison is standing on stage with JAMES FRANCO.
ALISON Hi, I'm Alison Scott and we're here today with James Franco from "Spider Man."
ALISON (CONT'D) How are you?
JAMES FRANCO Great.
ALISON Thanks for coming.
JAMES FRANCO Of course.
ALISON Tell me, were you a big fan...
Alison GULPS and appears uncomfortable.
ALISON (CONT'D) ...I'm sorry, let me take that again.
JAMES FRANCO Okay.
ALISON Tell me, were you a big fan of the comic books growing up?
JAMES FRANCO No, actually, I didn't read any of the comic books until I got the movie.
Alison stares at the floor looking ill.
She breathes heavily.
JAMES FRANCO (cont'd) Are you okay?
ALISON Uh-huh.
ALISON Yeah, just, what about the comic books?
ALISON Keep talking.
JAMES FRANCO Like I said I really wasn't into them, but now that I did the research, I think they're pretty amazing.
Alison runs offstage and VOMITS into a trash can.
Repeatedly.
JAMES FRANCO (cont'd) What the fuck?
Alison continues to puke.
Alison and her editor, BRENT, are watching the Franco/puking clips.
BRENT Is that the sound of you puking?
JAMES FRANCO (ON TV MONITOR) If this is one of those fuckin' joke shows, I'm not into it.
BRENT We should put this on YouTube.
ALISON Shut up.
BRENT This is hilarious.
ALISON You're an asshole.
BRENT Look how sweaty you are.
BRENT You look like Dom DeLuise.
ALISON I don't need to see it again.
ALISON It's gonna make me throw up.
BRENT You look like Jabba the Hutt dying.
Brent HISSES like Jabba the Hutt.
ALISON You're such an asshole.
BRENT I'm just jerking your chain.
BRENT I'll fix this.
BRENT No problem.
ALISON Yeah, maybe if you can just edit this out and we can re--
Alison swallows hard.
ALISON (CONT'D) --we can reshoot my questions.
Alison looks ill again.
BRENT What's up?
Alison is frantically looking for a place to vomit.
BRENT (CONT'D) (cont'd) Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.
Over here.
Not on the mixing board, not on the mixing board.
Alison finds the trash and VOMITS.
BRENT (CONT'D) Are you okay?
ALISON Oh my god.
ALISON Oh my god.
BRENT Are you sick?
ALISON I don't know.
BRENT What'd you eat?
ALISON I haven't eaten today yet.
BRENT You haven't eaten yet?
ALISON Do you have a napkin or something?
Brent grabs a stray piece of paper.
BRENT Here, here.
BRENT What do you have, like the flu?
ALISON I don't know.
BRENT God, I hope you're not pregnant.
ALISON It's impossible.
ALISON You have to have sex to get pregnant.
Alison reacts with a sad realization.
Brent picks up the phone.
BRENT B.K.
BRENT It's Brent Master Five.
BRENT Alison just puked.
BRENT Dude, that's what I said.
BRENT She's probably pregnant, right?
ALISON Oh, shit.
BRENT How does she look right now?
BRENT She looks like she just realized that she's pregnant.
Debbie and Alison are sitting on the bed.
ALISON No, I can't be pregnant.
ALISON Right?
ALISON That was what, eight weeks ago?
DEBBIE Did you miss your period?
ALISON No.
ALISON Wait.
ALISON I don't know.
ALISON Shit.
ALISON I don't know.
ALISON I can't remember.
ALISON I was, I mean, I've been really stressed at work.
ALISON I can't remember my last period.
DEBBIE Are you the lady who doesn't realize she's pregnant until she's sitting on the toilet and a kid pops out?
ALISON Can you not joke right now?
ALISON Don't joke right now.
ALISON This is really serious.
DEBBIE Did I meet him?
ALISON Yeah.
ALISON You know, he was kind of like medium height, sort of...chubby.
ALISON Blonde, curly hair.
ALISON Remember?
DEBBIE With the man boobs.
ALISON Yes!
ALISON Here, I have this thing of him on my phone.
Alison takes out her phone to play a video.
BEN (ON PHONE VIDEO) Hey!
BEN (ON PHONE VIDEO) I live in your phone!
BEN (ON PHONE VIDEO) This is the best night of my life!
BEN (ON PHONE VIDEO) I gotta pee.
DEBBIE Oh god.
DEBBIE How did this happen?
ALISON Oh, shit.
DEBBIE Well there's only one way to find out.
Alison and Debbie run down the aisles looking for pregnancy tests.
DEBBIE They're here!
DEBBIE Here they are!
DEBBIE Over here!
Every test on the shelf is pulled into their basket.
ALISON Okay.
ALISON "Positive Choice."
DEBBIE "Easy, One, Two, Three."
They run toward the check out counter.
They dump all the tests on the floor.
Alison sits on the toilet and rips one test open.
She puts the applicator between her legs.
ALISON Here.
ALISON Hurry up now.
ALISON Come on.
The test reads positive.
ALISON (CONT'D) Get more!
ALISON (CONT'D) Get me a few more!
DEBBIE Did you try the "Ova-Sure?"
Alison furiously drinks some juice.
ALISON I'm dripping, I'm dripping.
ALISON Wait.
They check another test.
DEBBIE Good!
DEBBIE A smiley face!
DEBBIE Oh, I think that's bad.
ALISON How long does this one take?
DEBBIE These can't all be positive.
DEBBIE Let me try one.
Pete enters to see Debbie sitting on the toilet.
Debbie urinates on the test and checks it.
ALISON God, you really had to pee.
Debbie picks up a test.
It's positive.
DEBBIE What is this?
DEBBIE What the hell is this?
ALISON I think you picked up the wrong one.
DEBBIE Fuck.
DEBBIE That scared me.
DEBBIE That would suck.
Alison glares at Debbie.
DEBBIE (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
DEBBIE (CONT'D) That scared me.
Alison is on a chaise lounge.
Debbie is sitting nearby.
ALISON It's gonna be fine.
ALISON Right?
Debbie contemplates.
ALISON (CONT'D) (cont'd) Right?
DEBBIE Of course it will be fine.
DEBBIE It's gonna be fine.
ALISON Shit.
DEBBIE You just need to call him.
ALISON Maybe I don't need to call him until after I see the doctor.
DEBBIE You need to call.
ALISON I don't want to call him.
ALISON I don't need to call him.
DEBBIE You should call.
ALISON I can't call him anyway.
ALISON He doesn't even have a phone.
ALISON He didn't even have a number to give me.
DEBBIE He doesn't have a phone?
ALISON Said some kind of billing issue.
DEBBIE He can't afford a phone?
DEBBIE Sadie has a phone.
ALISON Shit, you're right.
ALISON I got to call.
ALISON I don't know.
ALISON I'm gonna have to look him up on his stupid website.
DEBBIE What kind of website does he have?
Debbie and Alison sit at the computer looking at Flesh Of the Stars.
DEBBIE He spelling "coming" wrong.
DEBBIE Oh it's "cum."
DEBBIE That's gross.
ALISON Just go to "Contact Us."
DEBBIE Ben?
ALISON Yeah.
Debbie begins to type the email.
DEBBIE "What is your number?
DEBBIE I need to speak with you right away."
DEBBIE Send?
ALISON Yep.
DEBBIE You're sure?
ALISON Yeah.
Ben and his roommates are sitting around smoking weed.
JAY I love weed.
JONAH I could smoke weed every second of every day.
Ben wears a gas mask attached to a bong.
BEN Jay, I am your stoner.
Everyony LAUGHS.
Jason sits with his laptop.
JASON Hey, Benjamin?
BEN Yeah.
JASON "Flesh of the Stars" just got an e- mail.
BEN Really?
JASON Would you like me to read it to you?
BEN Yeah, sure.
JASON "Ben, what is your number?
JASON I need to speak to you right away.
JASON Alison Scott"
BEN, JASON & JONAH Ohhhhhh!
BEN Shit!
BEN Someone wants seconds, mama!
Jason types a reply while Ben watches on.
JASON "Looking forward to speaking with you."
BEN Yeah.
BEN Do one of those smiley faces at the end.
BEN Fuckin' A. Those are sexy.
JASON Sent.
Alison paces as she dials Ben's number.
The phone RINGS.
BEN Uh-oh!
JAY Somebody wants another piece!
BEN Shhh....
JAY Booty, booty, booty call.
BEN Hello?
ALISON Hi, Ben, this is Alison.
ALISON I don't know if you remember me.
BEN Oh, yeah, Alison.
BEN What's up?
Ben is humping Jason's head.
JONAH She like-a the way your dick tastes.
ALISON I actually was just wondering if maybe you, wanted to get together, like tomorrow night?
BEN I've been meaning to call you so we could hook up again.
BEN You know what I'm sayin'?
ALISON Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night?
ALISON You wanna just grab some dinner?
BEN Why not?
BEN Meeting of minds sounds good.
BEN What do you say Geisha House, Hollywood, nine o'clock?
ALISON Sure.
ALISON That's cool.
ALISON Can we make it more like six, though?
ALISON I'd like to keep it early.
BEN Six o'clock.
BEN Beat the rush.
BEN Yeah, leave more time for afterwards.
BEN Dessert.
BEN Sweet.
ALISON Okay.
ALISON I'll just meet you there, then, at six.
All the guys mime having sex with each other.
BEN I'll see you there.
BEN Take care.
BEN Peace.
ALISON Oh, shit.
BEN I'm gonna get laid mother fuckers!
High fives all around for Ben and the roommates.
Ben and Alison sit at a table in the crowded restaurant.
BEN Nice place, huh?
ALISON It's really nice.
BEN Sorry it took so long to get a table.
BEN I didn't realize you needed a reservation.
That's okay.
You look very pretty, though.
Thanks.
Yeah, I just thought, I don't know, I thought maybe it'd be cool to hang out a little bit and...
We didn't really get to talk much last time so I
That we didn't.
I thought maybe we'd just talk and get to know each other...better.
Cool.
Okay, I'll start.
I'm Canadian.
That's cool.
From Vancouver.
I live here illegally, actually.
Don't tell anyone.
But it works out in my advantage, ultimately, `cause I don't have to pay any taxes.
So financially that's helpful `cause I don't have a lot of money.
I'm not poor or anything but I eat a lot of spaghetti.
So the web page is it just something that you guys do for fun?
Do you have a real job?
Well, that is our job.
Oh.
We don't technically get money for the hours we put in, but it is our job.
So, how do you...?
How do I pay rent and shit?
Right.
When I was in high school, I got ran over by a postal truck.
Oh, my God.
It was my foot more than anything.
But, I got fourteen grand from the British Columbia government.
Right.
And that really lasted me until now.
It's been almost ten years.
I have like nine hundred bucks left.
So that should last me for I'm not a mathematician, but like another two years or some shit...I think.
Yeah.
So, I have something I really need to tell you.
It's kind of why I called you.
Here it goes.
I'm pregnant.
Fuck off.
What?
What?
I'm pregnant...?
With emotion?
With a baby.
You're the father.
I'm the father.
Yes!
How the fuck could this happen?
I don't know.
I thought you were wearing a condom.
No.
What?
I wasn't.
Why not?
Because you told me not to.
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
You told me not to.
I did not tell you not to wear a condom.
Here's what happened, okay?
I will give you a play-by-play of my memory.
I almost had the condom on my dick.
It was on the cusp and then you said, "Just do it, already."
I didn't mean do it without a condom.
I mean "do it" like "hurry up," like "get fucking going!"
Well, I assumed you were wearing a patch, or like a dental dam or one of those fuckin' butterfly clips or something like that.
What the hell is a dental dam?
It's like Saran Wrap!
It's disgusting, okay?
But I thought you had one.
Why the fuck didn't you stop me once we started?
Oh, my God!
I don't know!
I couldn't tell that you didn't have one on!
Obviously, I was drunk!
Was your vagina drunk?
Did you think it's the thinnest condom on earth I have on?
I'm a fuckin' inventor?
I made a dick-skin condom?
He hollowed out a penis and put it on?
What the fuck?!
You are unbelievable.
Okay, you know what?
Maybe, I've reacted unfavorably.
So what happens now?
I don't know how this works.
ALISON I am going to the doctor next week...and I thought you could come with me to the gynecologist.
BEN So you haven't seen him, though?
ALISON No.
BEN So you don't know if you're pregnant.
ALISON Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure.
BEN You're not a hundred percent sure.
BEN I bet you're not pregnant.
Ben and Alison sit in the crowded waiting room.
DR. PELLAGRINO'S NURSE Alison Scott?
ALISON Yeah, yeah.
ALISON Come on.
BEN I'm supposed to go?
ALISON Yes.
Alison is in a gown on the table.
Ben stands by looking at the diagrams on the wall.
DR.
PELLAGRINO enters.
DR. PELLAGRINO Hello.
DR. PELLAGRINO My name is Thomas Pellagrino.
BEN I'm Ben Stone.
DR. PELLAGRINO Hi, there, champ.
DR. PELLAGRINO And you must be Debbie's sister...Alice.
ALISON Alison.
DR. PELLAGRINO Hi.
DR. PELLAGRINO How are ya?
ALISON Good.
DR. PELLAGRINO So, what can I help you with today, Mister and Mrs. Stone?
ALISON I took a home pregnancy test and it said I was pregnant, so here we are.
DR. PELLAGRINO Let's have a look.
DR. PELLAGRINO Legs up.
Alison puts her legs up and leans back.
BEN Nice office.
DR. PELLAGRINO Thank you.
Dr. Pellagrino examines Allison's genital area.
DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd) Well, you do look a lot like your sister.
Dr. Pellagrino picks up a long cone shaped device.
DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd) This is gonna be cold.
DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd) And you're next.
DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd) I'm just kidding.
Dr. Pellagrino looks at Ben and shrugs like saying "this is just part of the job" as he puts the cone device inside Alison.
DR.
PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd) There's the cervix.
And the uterus.
See that?
That dark sac there, that's the amniotic sac.
And right there, in the middle is the embryo.
Do you see that flicker?
You know what that is?
That's the heartbeat.
Yeah, it looks like you are pregnant.
About eight or nine weeks, I'd say.
Congratulations.
Alison points to the monitor.
ALISON That, that's it?
DR. PELLAGRINO Yep.
DR. PELLAGRINO Take good care of it.
DR. PELLAGRINO Now the fun part starts.
DR. PELLAGRINO Let me make a picture for ya, huh?
DR. PELLAGRINO That'll be fun.
Alison begins to CRY.
DR.
PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd) Well, I'll meet ya in my office.
I'll give ya a little time alone, there.
Alison continues to cry.
Ben stands by SILENTLY, stunned.
BEN Oh, God.
BEN It's okay.
All the roommates and Ben sit around passing a bong.
JONAH I can't fuckin' believe you didn't wear a bag!
JONAH Who does that?!
JASON Why did we go to Costco and buy a year's supply of condoms if you weren't gonna use `em, man?
JONAH I can't believe you did this.
JONAH You fucked everything up.
JASON Look, the real point is not to get yourself in this position.
JASON That's what you have to realize.
JASON You gotta know all the tricks.
JASON Like, for example, if a woman's on top, she can't get pregnant.
JASON It's just gravity.
JONAH Everyone knows that.
JASON What goes up must come down.
JAY I think it's awesome that you're gonna have a kid, man.
JAY Think of it like this.
JAY It's just an excuse to play with all your old toys again.
JONAH You know what I think you should do?
JONAH Take care of it.
JAY Tell me you don't want him to get an "A word."
JONAH Yes, I do, and I won't say it for little Baby Ears over there, but it rhymes with shmish-mortion."
JONAH I'm just saying -- hold on Jay, cover your ears -- you should get a "shmish-morshmion" are the "shmish-morshmion" clinic.
JAY Ben, you cannot let these monsters have any part of your child's life.
JAY All right?
JAY I'm gonna be there to rear your child.
JASON You hear that, Ben?
JASON Don't let him near the kid.
JASON He wants to rear your child!
Ben gets up and leaves the room.
JONAH Aw, Ben.
JONAH Ben, come on, man.
JASON I'm just kidding you.
JAY Oh, great.
JAY Now he's upset.
JASON I won't let him do it.
Alison and her mother, BETTY, sit over lunch.
BETTY Alison, just take care of it.
BETTY Take care of it.
BETTY Move on.
BETTY What's gonna happen with your career?
BETTY Or how, how are you gonna tell them?
ALISON Well, I'm not gonna tell them for a while.
ALISON I have a while before I have to say anything.
BETTY How could you not tell them?
ALISON Well, they're not gonna know.
ALISON I mean, I'm only gonna start to show when I'm like, I don't know, six months or something.
ALISON Seven months.
BETTY Three months.
ALISON No.
BETTY Three months.
BETTY Fat in the face, jowls, fast ass.
ALISON Debbie didn't get fat.
BETTY Debbie is a freak of nature.
ALISON Mom, you know, it's important to me that you be supportive.
BETTY I cannot be supportive of this.
BETTY This is a mistake.
BETTY This is a big, big mistake.
BETTY Now think about your stepsister.
BETTY Now, you remember what happened with her?
BETTY She had the same situation as you and she had it taken care of.
BETTY And you know what?
BETTY Now she has a real baby.
BETTY Honey, this is not the time.
Ben and his father, HARRIS, sit at a table over lunch.
HARRIS I'm gonna be a grandfather.
BEN You happy about that?
HARRIS Absolutely.
HARRIS Delighted.
BEN This is a disaster.
HARRIS No, this is not a disaster.
BEN It is, you know?
HARRIS An earthquake is a disaster.
HARRIS Your grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad she doesn't even know who the fuck I am, that's a disaster.
HARRIS This is a good thing.
HARRIS This is a blessing.
BEN I had a vision for how my life would go and this definitely is not it.
HARRIS Wait.
HARRIS Are you living your vision right now?
BEN I am kinda living my vision, yeah.
HARRIS Well, that is sad, I'm telling you.
HARRIS Life doesn't care about your vision.
HARRIS Okay?
BEN Okay.
HARRIS Stuff happens.
HARRIS You just got to deal with it.
HARRIS Roll with it.
HARRIS That's the beauty of it all.
BEN I just don't get how I tell the kid not to do drugs when I do drugs.
BEN I'll feel like a hypocrite.
HARRIS Well you remember what I told you?
HARRIS When you were a teenager?
BEN What did you say?
HARRIS I said, "No pill, no powders."
BEN That's right, that's right.
HARRIS Right.
HARRIS If it grows in the ground, it's probably okay.
BEN I guess it worked.
BEN You told me not to smoke pot all those years.
BEN And then I found out you were smoking pot that whole time.
HARRIS Not the whole time.
HARRIS Just in the evenings and all day every weekend.
HARRIS Not that much.
BEN Honestly, though, when you look at me, do you not think at all, like, you know, if he just never existed, I would have avoided a massive heap of trouble?
BEN You know?
HARRIS Absolutely not.
HARRIS I love you totally and completely.
HARRIS You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
BEN I'm the best thing that ever happened to you?
HARRIS Yeah.
BEN Now I just feel bad for you.
Alison dials the phone.
Ben picks up.
BEN Hello?
ALISON Hi, Ben?
BEN Hey Alison, how's it goin'?
ALISON Good, good.
ALISON You know, I was just calling to, let you know that, I've decided to keep the baby.That's what's happening with that.
BEN Good.
BEN That's good.
BEN That's what I was hoping you'd do.
BEN So, awesome.
ALISON Yeah, yeah, it is good.
BEN I know we didn't plan this and neither of us really thought it was gonna happen but life is like that, you know?
BEN You can't plan for it and even if we did, life doesn't care about your plans, necessarily, and you just kinda have to go with the flow and I just know my job is to just support you in whatever it is you wanna do.
BEN I'm in, so whatever you wanna do, I'm gonna do.
Alison WEEPS softly into the phone.
BEN(CONT'D) I'm on board.
BEN(CONT'D) Yaaay.
ALISON I really appreciate you saying that.
BEN No problem.
BEN I'll tell you, maybe if you could help me by telling me, like one thing that I am supposed to do, then that would be good, `cause I literally have no idea whatsoever.
ALISON I have no idea either.
BEN Do you want to, like, get together and talk about it or something like that?
ALISON Yeah, sure.
BEN Like a date?
BEN I mean...
ALISON Yeah.
Alison drives up to Ben's House.
Alison KNOCKS on the door and Ben answers.
ALISON Hi.
BEN You look beautiful.
ALISON Thank you.
BEN No problem.
BEN Come on in.
Ben leads Alison into the living room where the rest of the roommates are hanging out.
BEN (CONT'D) Everyone, this is Alison.
ALISON Hi.
JASON Ally.
JASON Hey.
JASON Jason.
JASON I'm sure you remember.
ALISON Yes.
JASON You look beautiful.
ALISON Thank you.
JASON Your body's responding really well to the pregnancy.
ALISON Thank you.
JASON It's amazing how fast the milk arrives.
JASON How's your sis?
ALISON She's good.
JASON Oh, good.
JASON Tell her "What's up" for me.
ALISON Okay.
JASON All right, I'm gonna go make a protein shake.
BEN And this, uh, beautiful young man is Jonah.
ALISON Hi.
JONAH Hey.
BEN Okay, that's Martin and Jodi over there.
ALISON Hi.
BEN I'm gonna grab my shirt.
BEN Just take a seat if you want.
Ben exits.
Jonah is watching the lesbian sex scene in "Wild Things."
JONAH Just another day at the office.
JONAH Do you have any acting experience?
ALISON No.
MARTIN How's it goin'?
MARTIN You wanna toke?
ALISON Eh, no.
ALISON I'm good.
JODI Hi.
ALISON Hi.
JODI I'm Jodi.
ALISON Yeah, hi.
JODI I heard you were pregnant.
ALISON Mm-hm.
JODI Oh, aren't you scared?
JODI The way it's gonna come out of your...It's gonna hurt a lot I bet.
JODI Your vagina...That's so sick.
ALISON I don't know.
JODI Are you hungry?
ALISON I'm okay right now.
ALISON Thank you.
JODI You must be angry at the baby whenever it steals your food, huh?
JODI "Oh it's mine, not yours."
JODI But, you know...
JODI Because you're family, you got to share.
ALISON Right.
Jay enters the room in a towel after a shower.
JAY Man, my balls are shaved.
JAY My pubes are trimmed.
JAY I'm ready to fuckin' rock this shit.
JONAH What the fuck, man?!
JONAH If I go in there and see fuckin' pubes sprinkled on the toiled seat, I'm gonna fuckin' lose my mind!
JONAH Last time I went to the bathroom, Jay, I took a shit and my shit looked like a fuckin' stuffed animal!
JAY You're embarrassing me in company!
JONAH You embarrass yourself!
JAY Oh, great.
JAY I hope you have a great evening!
Jay exits.
Ben enters in his new shirt.
BEN All right.
BEN Let's go.
BEN See you guys later.
Establishing shot.
Alison and Ben sit in a booth over appetizers.
ALISON The funny thing is I really had never even thought about having a baby.
BEN Yeah.
ALISON If this hadn't happened, I don't think I would have wanted to have a baby for, like, I don't know, at least ten years.
BEN At least!
BEN God, honestly, I just got used to the notion that someone would even have sex with me.
BEN I didn't think this would happen.
Establishing shot.
Ben puts on a baby hat and holds a baby outfit in front of him.
BEN Get ready.
BEN This will be coming out of you in seven months.
BEN This is exactly what our baby will look like.
ALISON It's a beautiful picture, Ben.
BEN It is.
BEN It's not bad.
BEN Hello, Mommy.
BEN Our baby's gonna be French Canadian.
BEN I like that.
ALISON With a little hint of Spanish.
BEN Exactly, I'm not good with accents.
Establishing shot.
Ben and Alison browse the baby section.
BEN Baby books.
ALISON Awesome.
BEN "What to Expect When You're Expecting."
ALISON What can we expect?
BEN Well, you can't eat sushi.
BEN You can't smoke.
BEN You can't smoke marijuana.
BEN You can't smoke crack.
BEN And you can't jump on trampolines.
BEN This is basically a giant list of things you can't do.
ALISON It sounds thrilling.
BEN I'm gonna be sitting there on the trampoline smoking crack.
BEN And you're not gonna have anything to do.
BEN You're gonna be bored.
BEN But I can't wait to read these, honestly.
BEN I put these in front of my toilet, though, they'll be read by tomorrow morning.
BEN Do you want me to get you that?
ALISON Yeah, thank you.
BEN No problem.
BEN These are heavy.
Ben and Alison walk side-by-side carrying their purchases.
They both reach over and hold hands.
Debbie and Pete get ready for bed at separate sinks.
PETE So what do you think?
PETE Should we have sex tonight?
DEBBIE Ugh.
DEBBIE Sounds awful.
DEBBIE I'm just really constipated.
DEBBIE Do you really want to?
PETE Well, now.
DEBBIE Shut up.
PETE That's pretty crazy how your sister's pregnant.
DEBBIE We have to help her.
PETE I think they'll be fine.
PETE They'll work it...Look at us.
PETE It happened to us.
DEBBIE We'll help her raise the baby.
PETE Well...fuck!
Establishing shot.
Alison and Ben stand while kissing.
BEN At least we don't have to use a condom, you know?
Alison pulls away.
BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) But we can.
I brought some just in case.
I don't have V.D. or anything.
I mean, I don't, I thought--
ALISON It's not that.
BEN It's just I thought we could get a little...fun out of your situation, you know?
ALISON Okay, first of all, it's not my situation.
ALISON It's our situation.
BEN I know that.
ALISON And just because I'm pregnant, I'm not some ruined woman and all romance goes out the door.
BEN I'm sorry.
BEN I like you a lot.
BEN That's all this is.
ALISON I like you, too.
BEN Sweet.
ALISON A little, so far.
ALISON I mean, we have seven months before the baby comes.
ALISON We don't have to rush it.
BEN Yeah.
ALISON We should really just try to get to know each other and...give this a real shot.
ALISON You know?
ALISON We got ourselves into this situation.
ALISON We kind of have to.
BEN For the baby, right?
ALISON Exactly.
ALISON Okay, if this was our second date, what would you do?
BEN B.J.
BEN If I'm just being honest.
BEN I told my roommates that I thought I was gonna get a B.J., so...
ALISON You know what?
ALISON For the sake of getting to know one another, can you not talk like that?
BEN I can do that.
BEN I'm really nervous.
ALISON I'm nervous, too.
ALISON I'm really nervous.
BEN Yeah.
Ben and Alison kiss.
ALISON You're a sweet guy, right?
BEN I think I am.
ALISON Don't fuck me over, okay?
BEN I wouldn't do that.
BEN Just so you know, I'm the guy girls fuck over.
BEN I'm that guy.
BEN So you don't fuck me over, okay?
ALISON Okay.
BEN I couldn't take it.
BEN I can't raise this baby alone.
Ben and Alison kiss.
Establishing shot.
Debbie, Pete, Charlotte, Sadie, Alison and Ben eat breakfast together.
CHARLOTTE Who's he?
BEN I'm Ben Stone.
ALISON He's my boyfriend.
PETE That's nice.
SADIE I never met him before.
ALISON He's a new boyfriend.
BEN But a boyfriend.
SADIE So he came over for breakfast because he's your new boyfriend?
DEBBIE He came from his house, drove over to our house because he thought it would be fun to have breakfast with us, so he drove his car from his house to our house to have breakfast.
PETE Because he likes breakfast so much.
CHARLOTTE I love breakfast.
BEN You guys wanna hear something neat?
BEN We're gonna have a baby together.
SADIE What?
BEN Yeah, a baby.
SADIE Well, you're not married.
SADIE Aren't you supposed to be married to have a baby?
PETE You don't have to be.
DEBBIE But they should be because they love each other and people who love each other get married and have babies.
SADIE Where do babies come from?
DEBBIE Where do you think they come from?
SADIE Well, I think a stork, he drops it down, and then, a hole goes in your body and there's blood everywhere, coming out of your head, and then you push your belly-button, and then your butt falls off and then you hold you butt and you have to dig and you find a little baby.
DEBBIE That's exactly right.
Ben is in a playhouse with Sadie while Charlotte jumps on the trampoline.
CHARLOTTE Feed the teddy bear.
BEN I feed your bear the grass?
BEN Know what your bear would also like to do with some grass?
BEN Smoke it.
Allison and Debbie watch Ben and the kids from the patio.
ALISON What do you think of him?
ALISON He's funny, right?
Ben throws the bear's bowl.
BEN Fetch.
BEN All right, bring it back.
DEBBIE He's playing fetch with my kids.
DEBBIE He's treating my kids like they're dogs.
ALISON No's he not.
Ben throws the bear this time.
BEN Go get it!
BEN Fetch!
DEBBIE Plays fetch with the kids.
BEN All right!
ALISON He's trying.
ALISON He's making an effort.
CHARLOTTE I don't wanna play this anymore.
BEN Bring it back.
DEBBIE He's overweight.
DEBBIE Where does that end?
DEBBIE How old is he?
ALISON Twenty-three.
DEBBIE Looks thirty-three.
DEBBIE He can barely get in and out of that little house.
DEBBIE Imagine how much bigger he's going to get.
Ben tries to exit the playhouse but gets stuck a couple times.
DEBBIE (CONT'D) That means he has bad genes.
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Your kid is going to be overweight.
ALISON Shit.
BEN I'm gonna get you!
Ben chases the girls on top of the trampoline.
BEN (CONT'D) I'm gonna get you!
BEN (CONT'D) Whoa!
Ben falls off the trampoline onto the grass.
The kids love it.
ALISON Just give him a break.
DEBBIE Okay, I'll try.
Charlotte pegs a beach ball at Ben's head.
Ben and Pete sit while Charlotte and Sadie blow bubbles.
BEN They seem to love bubbles.
PETE They go ape-shit over bubbles.
BEN They're really going ape-shit.
PETE That's an incredible thing about a child.
PETE What's so great about bubbles?
BEN They float.
BEN You can pop them.
BEN I mean, I get it.
BEN I get it.
PETE I wish I liked anything as much as my kids like bubbles.
BEN That's sad.
PETE It's totally sad.
PETE Their smiling faces just point out your inability to enjoy anything.
BEN Am I going to be okay, man?
PETE Who knows?
PETE Is anybody okay?
PETE I'm not okay.
PETE You're asking the wrong guy.
PETE Just don't ask me to lend you any money, you know?
BEN Can I just have some?
PETE No.
Jason and Jonah play ping-pong while the rest of the roommates, including Ben, watch.
JASON I have fifteen years of tennis lessons.
And twelve years of sucking dick lessons.
So?
I can't ref the next games, by the way.
I got to go meet gynecologists with Alison.
She doesn't like her gynecologist.
You think she likes you?
She's trying to.
She's entertaining the idea of liking you.
Exactly.
I'll take that.
Wll, see she's bringing you to the gynechiatrist.
She must like you.
That's pretty good, I think.
You know who I'd like to get pregnant is that Felicity Huffman, man.
Ever since "Transamerica," I can't get her out of my mind.
Guys, I hate to crack the whip, but it's kind of, uh, business meeting time.
I need moolah.
When do you think we can launch this site?
Geez.
You can't rush this.
You know what happens to these sites when they go up and they don't function well?
They die.
Seriously, guys, let's say I want to launch today.
Let's start...
let's use that as a jumping off point.
Let's make this happen.
What can we do?
Look, man, I didn't go to Yale so I could work twelve hours a day.
JASON I thought you went to Santa Monica City College.
JONAH I went where I went, Jason.
BEN I'm not asking you to work twelve hours a day.
BEN I mean, you guys watch movies without nudity in them.
JASON I'll tell you what, man.
JASON We could probably get it online in three months.
BEN Thank you.
BEN Yes!
BEN Three months.
JONAH Come on, Jason!
Jason serves the ball and Jonah hits it as hard as he can to win the game.
JONAH (CONT'D) Fuck off!
JASON Yeah, well, you still have a little dick, Cartman.
Ben and Alison drive to the gynecologist.
Alison is on the examination table while DR.

ALISON I have on occasion.
DR. KUNI On occasion?
DR. KUNI When?
DR. KUNI When was the last time you had one cig?
DR. KUNI You know, on, you know, a little...I need to know or I will not be your doctor.
Ben and Alison are in a spin class.
Ben is sweating profusely.
ALISON How ya doing?
BEN I'm breathing like James Gandolfini over here.
A person next to them peddles extremely fast.
BEN (CONT'D) Slow down, man.
BEN (CONT'D) You're making me look like a jackass.
Alison is on the table with her legs up while a YOUNG DOCTOR examines her.
Ben sits by Alison.
YOUNG DOCTOR How long you kids been married?
BEN We're not.
ALISON No.
YOUNG DOCTOR You're single?
BEN She's not single.

Alison and Ben share a look of disbelief that the doctor is hitting on her.
Jodi and Alison are in the kitchen, cutting vegetables.
JODI Hey, you wanna trade boyfriends?
JODI Just kidding.
JODI Kind of.
Alison is on the table while a FEMALE DOCTOR examines her.
Ben watched on.
FEMALE DOCTOR Wow.
FEMALE DOCTOR That is not your vagina.
FEMALE DOCTOR That's your asshole.
FEMALE DOCTOR That happens about five times a day.
Alison and Ben sit on the couch.
The rest of the roommates are all suited up for paintball.
JAY Are you sure you don't want to come paint-balling?
BEN Have fun, guys.
BEN Seriously, watch the eyes.
JAY All right.
JASON See ya, Ally.
JONAH Peace.
JAY Bye.
Alison looks at Ben.
BEN I don't want to go.
BEN I swear to God.
BEN I want to see "Breathless" at the LACMA.
Alison is watching a movie during a scene with a topless woman.
ALISON Boobs!
ALISON Boobs!
ALISON Boobs!
Ben runs in.
BEN Hold on, pause it, pause it, pause it.
ALISON Boobs and bush.
Ben hops on the couch the log the scene for the website.
ALISON (CONT'D) Good boobs.
BEN Those are good ones!
BEN We're like thirty- five seconds in.
ALISON Right over the beginning credits.
BEN Nice.
BEN Credit bush.
BEN You never get opening-credit bush.
ALISON I know.
ALISON That's so crazy.
Alison sits on the side as Ben plays with Charlotte and Sadie in the pool.
BEN You got me.
BEN You got me.
Ben and Alison sit across the desk from DR.
HOWARD.
ALISON How many doctors are there in your practice?
ALISON Just because I'm sort of looking for a more personal experience.
ALISON I want to make sure that you're my doctor on the day and...
DR. HOWARD I understand.
DR. HOWARD We have three other doctors in the practice but I'm your man, okay?
DR. HOWARD I don't take vacations.
DR. HOWARD I hate Hawaii.
DR. HOWARD I went to the Caribbean when I was fourteen and I'm never going back.
ALISON I feel really good about this.
ALISON I think we found our doctor.
BEN Really?
ALISON Yeah.
BEN Oh, my God.
BEN Are you serious right now?
DR. HOWARD You look relieved.
BEN I am very relieved.
DR. HOWARD All right.
BEN I can't imagine meeting and more of you people.
ALISON You're being dramatic.
ALISON We didn't meet that many.
Alison is being measured by the WARDROBE LADY.
WARDROBE LADY Ooh.
WARDROBE LADY Do they know?
ALISON Pardon?
WARDROBE LADY The belly.
ALISON The doughnuts, they call to me.
Jill walks by.
JILL Hey, Alison!
ALISON Hi.
JILL Great job.
ALISON Thanks.
JILL For you.
WARDROBE LADY You're pregnant aren't you?
ALISON What?
WARDROBE LADY I mean, you've put on like eight pounds, nine.
WARDROBE LADY It's all in your uterus.
ALISON Oh, shit.
ALISON I haven't told them.
ALISON Do you think they're gonna be mad?
ALISON I'm really chickening out about this.
WARDROBE LADY It's okay.
WARDROBE LADY We can hide this.
WARDROBE LADY We'll dress you in black and we'll emphasize your boobs.
ALISON Awesome.
WARDROBE LADY Your boobs are going to be big.
WARDROBE LADY And then they're going to be like scary big.
WARDROBE LADY But then they'll go down.
WARDROBE LADY And then they'll stay down.

Debbie and Pete use a laptop.
Ben enters.
DEBBIE Ooh.
DEBBIE Did you see this sex offender website?
DEBBIE These are all the sex offenders in our neighborhood.
Debbie points to the screen which has a map with red dots spread over it.
PETE Looks like your computer has chicken pox.
DEBBIE Those are sex offenders.
DEBBIE These people live in our neighborhood.
PETE We'll skip their houses when we're trick or treating.
PETE What do you want me to do?
PETE Form a posse?
PETE Got your six-shooter on ya?
PETE I got my lynching rope.
DEBBIE You shouldn't take it so lightly.
PETE I don't take it lightly.
PETE I'm not going to go over to any of these people's houses and say, "Hey, you mind?
PETE Can you baby sit?"
DEBBIE If I didn't care about these things, you wouldn't care about anything.
DEBBIE Care more.
PETE You're so concerned with stuff, like don't get them vaccinated, don't let them eat fish.
PETE There's mercury in the water.
PETE Jesus, how much "Dateline NBC" can you watch?
DEBBIE I know we're supposed to be nice with each other right now, but I'm having a really hard time.
DEBBIE I'm struggling with it right now.
PETE What am I doing?
DEBBIE Because I want to rip your fucking head off because you're so fucking stupid!
DEBBIE This is scary.
DEBBIE (CONT'D) These are our children.
DEBBIE (CONT'D) You fucking dipshit!
PETE I literally am at a point where I don't know what I can say.
DEBBIE So I'm the bad guy because I'm trying to protect our kids from child molesters and mercury?
DEBBIE And you're cool because you don't give a shit?
PETE Yeah.
DEBBIE Yeah?
DEBBIE Is that it?
PETE Pretty much.
DEBBIE God, you're an asshole.
PETE Don't do this in front of Ben.
DEBBIE I don't give a shit about Ben.
PETE Sorry, Ben.
BEN It's okay.
BEN I didn't think she did, anyway.
Alison enters.
ALISON Okay, come on!
ALISON Let's go.
PETE I can't go.
PETE This band is doing a showcase out in the Valley.
PETE I got to go.
DEBBIE It's Saturday.
PETE I got to go.
Debbie and Alison are browsing the baby furniture.
Ben trails behind.
DEBBIE You don't want to know the sex of the baby?
DEBBIE That's no fun.
ALISON Ben knows, but I've sworn him to secrecy.
DEBBIE I'll get it out of him.
Ben are looks at Baby Bjorn baby carriers.
He brings ones to Alison.
BEN Hey.
BEN Think we'll ever be as happy as Baby Bjorn couple is?
ALISON We are that happy.
BEN Yeah.
BEN You look happy.
ALISON Which is awesome.
ALISON Because I never like guys like you.
ALISON It's great.
BEN You keep saying that.
BEN I know.
Alison and Ben walk over to Debbie who is in front of a crib.
DEBBIE This is it.
DEBBIE This is perfect.
BEN Nice.
Ben looks at the price tag.
BEN (CONT'D) Holy shit, it's fourteen hundred bucks.
ALISON We can just borrow yours.
ALISON Is that okay?
DEBBIE No.
DEBBIE You need your own crib.
BEN There's one of these in an alley behind my house.
BEN We could just grab that.
BEN Just rub Purell all over it.
DEBBIE You know what?
DEBBIE Let me buy it.
DEBBIE I need to get you a baby present anyway, and I would love to get it for you.
ALISON No.
DEBBIE I'm serious.
DEBBIE I want to.
ALISON No.
ALISON It's too much.
BEN Shh.
BEN Yes.
BEN We'll take it obviously.
BEN I mean don't insult the woman.
BEN She wants to get us a gift.
DEBBIE Right.
BEN Want to buy me some new clothes?
BEN What else can I squeeze out of you?
Alison and Ben are carrying clothes to the car.
Alison stops in her tracks when she sees a group of two young women and a man approaching.
ALISON It's so hot in the Valley.
GIRL #1 Hey!
GIRL #2 Oh, my God!
ALISON Oh, shit.
GIRL #1 Alison!
Hi!
Oh, it's so good to see you.
You too.
Oh, my God.
We've been watching you on E!
It's the coolest thing.
Yeah, it's been super-exciting, just crazy busy.
I'm so sorry I haven't called.
Oh, it's fine.
Hi, I'm Ashley.
This is my friend, Ben.
I'm Ben.
I went to school with Alison.
So, okay, so is Debbie having another baby?
No.
Alison is.
What?!
I just saw you a couple months ago.
You're pregnant?
It was a big surprise.
It's a really funny story, actually, if you guys, if you got a second to hear it.
It's not really funny.
Tell us.
It's not funny.
Let them be the judge, okay?
I think it's funny.
ALISON All right.
BEN You know they say don't drink and drive?
GUY #1 Right.
BEN Don't drink and bone!
GIRL #2 Wow.
Establishing shot.
Ben and Pete browse the records.
BEN Yeah, she was acting weird and I really think it's just because I haven't made an honest woman out of her.
BEN She's carrying my bastard child.
BEN No one wants that.
PETE That's what I did.
PETE I married Debbie when she got pregnant.
BEN You think she's, like, hiding me?
BEN Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me or something like that?
PETE Probably.
PETE I'd hide you.
BEN How much do wedding rings cost?
PETE It really depends, you know?
PETE I think you're supposed to spend three months pay on a ring.
BEN That'll be easy.
BEN I don't make any money.
PETE Really?
PETE I thought there was a lot of money in porn.
BEN God, it's not porn?
BEN All we do is we show you what nude scenes are in what movies.
PETE Like Mister Skin?
BEN Who's Mister Skin?
PETE Dude, Mister Skin.
Pete imitates the Mister Skin logo smile.
Ben and the roommates look at the Mister Skin website.
JONAH We've wasted fourteen months of our lives.
BEN This is exactly the same as our site.
BEN How the fuck did this happen?
JONAH Mister Skin!
JONAH That's even a better name than ours!
MARTIN Well, fuck me in the beard.
JASON Dude, they got the top ten group shower scenes!
JASON Why didn't you think of that, Jay!
JAY Don't put this on me!
BEN God damn it!
MARTIN Well shit.
MARTIN I saw it online at one point, but I guess I didn't connect the dots.
JONAH What are we gonna do now?
BEN All we need to do is think of a new, better idea that no one else has thought of already.
JASON "Spiderman Three" starts in eight minutes.
JONAH Shit.
JONAH Don't worry.
JONAH We'll figure it out.
Jonah, Jason and Martin exit.
Ben and Jay sit at the desk.
BEN You know what?
BEN Just because this site exists doesn't mean ours won't work.
BEN Good things come in pairs.
JAY For sure.
BEN "Volcano," "Dante's Peak."
BEN "Deep Impact," "Armageddon."
BEN "Wyatt Earp," "Tombstone."
JAY Panda Express, Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.
BEN Exactly.
BEN We can work together.
BEN This helps us, if anything.
JAY We're golden.
Establishing shot.
Alison sits on the bed while Ben kneels in front of her.
BEN Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you pictured it being exactly and it's not how I wanted it.
BEN That is why I'm presenting you with this empty box.
BEN It's a promise, Alison.
BEN A promise that one day I will fill this with a ring that you deserve, a beautiful ring.
BEN I can't afford it yet.
BEN I've picked it out, though.
BEN It's at De Beers and it's really nice.
BEN So, basically, I'm asking you, will you marry me?
BEN Because I'm in love with you.
ALISON I love you too.
BEN Really?
BEN That's so nice to hear.
BEN That's the first time a girl's ever said that to me.
ALISON But here's the thing.
BEN There's a thing?
ALISON I don't really know yet what that love means.
ALISON It's so new and it's so exciting.
ALISON It's great.
ALISON I don't know.
ALISON We've only known each other for seventeen weeks.
BEN Look, I thought you felt weird that we're having a baby and we're not engaged.
BEN I'm going to get off my knee.
BEN It hurts.
Ben sits next to Alison on the bed.
ALISON I'm okay with that.
ALISON We're just doing what we can.
ALISON I don't want us to put any more pressure on ourselves than we have.
BEN That makes sense.
ALISON I didn't hurt your feelings, did I?
BEN No.
BEN I just wanted to do right by you.
BEN If you don't want to, that's totally cool.
ALISON I really do love you.
BEN I know.
BEN Thanks.
BEN You mentioned that.
BEN It's nice.
Debbie and Alison eat ice cream in bed and watch TV.
ALISON Ben proposed to me.
ALISON He did.
ALISON It was really sweet.
ALISON I feel a little bad.
ALISON He was wearing this great button-down.
ALISON He tucked it in.
ALISON He got down on one knee.
ALISON He didn't have an actual ring, though, just an empty box but he had this whole spiel about when he has the money, he'll buy me the ring I deserve.
DEBBIE The box was empty?
ALISON He can't afford a ring.
DEBBIE So he got down on one knee and gave you an empty box?
ALISON Yes.
DEBBIE I'm sorry.
ALISON Get over it.
ALISON If you'd been there, you would have cried.
DEBBIE You need to train him.
DEBBIE Oprah said that when two people meet they should point out each other's differences and flaws.
ALISON I thought you should love people for who they are.
DEBBIE You criticize them a lot, so they get so down on themselves they have to change.
ALISON You don't think that's naggy?
DEBBIE In the end, they thank you for it.
Debbie drives Alison and the girls in her car.
DEBBIE You can't commit to him.
DEBBIE You don't even know him.
DEBBIE I don't even know Pete after ten years.
DEBBIE I don't know what he's up to.
DEBBIE He's miserable.
ALISON Why do you say that?
DEBBIE I think he's cheating on me.
DEBBIE He's always going to business meetings at odd hours.
DEBBIE Then I try to call him on his cell phone and he says he's in bad cell phone reception areas when he's in good reception areas.
ALISON Maybe he's working late.
ALISON Maybe he's trying to sign a new band.
ALISON I can't imagine Pete doing that.
DEBBIE There's no part of you that thinks maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?
ALISON No.
DEBBIE I think he might be.
Debbie installs software on the computer while Alison watches.
DEBBIE "Memory Spy Web Memory Software.
DEBBIE Locate history, files, websites visited, hidden downloads, e-mail history.
DEBBIE Memory Spy."
DEBBIE Let's see you hide from me now, little man.
Alison is disturbed by this whole ordeal.
Debbie, Pete, Alison and Ben eat dinner together.
PETE You're not going to tell them?
ALISON No.
ALISON I don't have to.
ALISON It's illegal for them to fire me over it.
ALISON And I get three months maternity leave if I stay.
ALISON So I'm not going to tell them.
DEBBIE Good plan.
PETE I like it.
BEN It's a good plan until her water breaks over Robert De Niro's shoes.
BEN (impersonating Robert De
NIRO) My shoes.
NIRO) There's baby goo on them.
PETE (impersonating Robert De
NIRO) These shoes?
NIRO) On these shoes?
NIRO) Did you puke on my shoes?
BEN (impersonating Robert De
NIRO) Is your water on my shoes?
PETE Isn't it weird, though, when you have a kid and all your dreams and hopes go right out the window.
DEBBIE What changed for you?
DEBBIE What went out the window?
DEBBIE You do everything exactly the same.
PETE No, I love what I'm doing.
PETE But say before you're married with children you want to live in India for a year.
PETE You can do it.
DEBBIE You want to go to India?
DEBBIE Go to India!
DEBBIE Seriously.
PETE Do you want to go to India?
DEBBIE No.
DEBBIE You can go.
BEN I get what he means.
BEN Honestly, when I found out about...
Ben motions towards Alison.
BEN (CONT'D) ...I had this flash of me in a white Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada.
BEN (CONT'D) The chopper's taping it, and I bust through the border and I'm free!
BEN (CONT'D) I kept thinking that.
Alison stares at Ben.
BEN (CONT'D) It was a flash!
ALISON What do you mean?
BEN Don't look at me.
BEN We can talk about our fears here.
BEN If Doc Brown screeched up to you in the DeLorean and said, "Alison, I got the car here.
BEN What do you want to do?" No part of you would think, "Maybe I'll go back to that night and put a condom on Ben's dick?" You never got that flash?
ALISON No.
ALISON What are you talking about?
PETE "Where we're going, we don't need roads."
BEN You wouldn't do that?
ALISON I don't know who Doc Brown is.
ALISON What are you talking about?
BEN Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd.
BEN He invented the DeLorean time machine.
PETE Everyone has a time machine image.
DEBBIE I have a really good idea.
DEBBIE Why don't you two get in your time machine, go back in time and fuck each other?
PETE Who needs a time machine?
Ben holds up his drink.
BEN This is my time machine!
PETE I'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun it to 88.
BEN You are a funny motherfucker, man.
BEN How can you fight with him?
BEN I just want to kiss his face.
BEN He's cute.
PETE I like the way you move.
BEN This is fun!
BEN We should do this more.
BEN This is the most fun I've had in a really long time.
Establishing shot.
Ben and Alison are having sex.
Ben is on top.
ALISON Come on, harder.
BEN I can't.
ALISON Why?
ALISON Just do it deeper.
BEN I can't.
ALISON Why?
BEN I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.
ALISON Just do it!
BEN Please don't yell at me.
ALISON The doctor and Debbie said it's fine.
ALISON Come on!
Ben stops.
BEN I'm sorry, can we change positions?
BEN I'm going to crush the baby.
ALISON That's ridiculous!
BEN No, it's not.
BEN It has no shell.
ALISON Millions of people have sex when they're pregnant!
ALISON It just works!
BEN I weigh over 200 pounds.
ALISON Just get over it.
BEN I can't do it.
BEN Can you just get on top?
BEN All I can see if our baby, poked in the face by my penis.
ALISON Trust me, you're not even close.
ALISON Okay, fine.
Alison moves on top.
Alison abruptly stops.
ALISON (CONT'D) I can't do this.
ALISON (CONT'D) I can't focus like this.
ALISON (CONT'D) I look disgusting from this angle.
ALISON (CONT'D) I can feel you looking at my chins.
BEN You look beautiful.
BEN Your chin looks so skinny.
ALISON And my boobs are all like, squishy and they're flopping around.
ALISON I can feel it and it's distracting.
ALISON It's all National Geographic.
BEN Do you want to do it doggie style?
ALISON No.
ALISON I do not want you to fuck me like a dog.
BEN I'm not fucking you like a dog.
BEN It's doggie style.
BEN It's just the style.
BEN I'm, it's not like a dog.
BEN We don't have to go outside or anything.
Ben and Alison lie down side by side, Ben is behind.
BEN (CONT'D) Here we go.
BEN (CONT'D) Is it good?
ALISON Yeah.
BEN Should I go slower?
ALISON Harder.
BEN Just tell me when you're close.
ALISON Just go harder.
BEN Okay.
ALISON Keep going!
Ben recoils.
BEN Oh, God.
BEN Oh, fuck!
ALISON What happened?
BEN The baby.
BEN It kicked my hand.
ALISON It always kicks.
BEN No, no, no, no, no.
ALISON It's fine.
BEN Not like this.
BEN No, this was a warning kick.
ALISON Just keep going.
BEN This was a bad kick.
ALISON It's fine!
ALISON It's fine!
BEN Look.
BEN My dick must be like an inch away from its face and it's coming, just coming in at its face.
BEN What if it kicked because it didn't like it?
BEN I can't do that to our baby.
BEN That's the first thing it's going to see.
ALISON What are you talking about?
BEN It's having the baby between us, it just makes it weird.
BEN I'm sorry.
BEN It just freaks me out a bit.
BEN It's a little weird.
ALISON I have totally lost it now.
BEN You've totally lost it?
ALISON I've lost it.
BEN Okay.
ALISON Great, you know what?
ALISON Just forget it.
Alison turns her back to Ben and gets settled to sleep.
ALISON (CONT'D) Don't worry.
ALISON (CONT'D) I won't make you do this again.
BEN Shit.
Ben smokes his bong.
Suddenly, there is an earthquake.
Alison wakes up from the earthquake in a panic.
ALISON Ben?
Ben stands up and tries to steady himself.
BEN Fuck me.
Jay runs through the room towards the front door.
JAY Oh my God!
JAY It's the Russians.
Martin carries Jodi out.
MARTIN Jodi!
MARTIN I'll protect you!
Ben clutches his bong and runs to the door.
Alison runs to the door as well.
ALISON Ben!
BEN Oh, my God!
BEN Oh, no!
BEN Oh, no!
Jay, Martin, Alison, Jodi, Jonah, Jason and Ben stand on the street.
Jason is naked.
Jonah's girlfriend ALEX is also naked.
JAY That was horrible!
JAY That was so horrible.
JASON You're fine, man.
JAY When will it be light out?
JASON Take it easy.
JAY When will it be light out?
JASON Did anybody turn off the gas?
MARTIN I didn't do it.
JASON Oh, motherfucker.
Jason runs back to the house.
JONAH Martin, this is my friend, Alex.
JONAH She's a pretty incredible person.
MARTIN Nice to meet you.
Martin holds out his hand to shake Alex's.
She removes one hand from covering her breast to shake his hand.
Jonah immediately covers her breast with his hand.
JONAH Whoa, whoa, whoa.
JONAH Dude!
JONAH Not cool, Martin.
MARTIN That's, that wasn't...
JONAH Hey, are you serious, Howard Hughes?
JODI What happened?
MARTIN Nothing.
MARTIN Nothing happened.
MARTIN Come on.
ALISON Where were you?
BEN Look, I forgot you were sleeping over.
BEN I'm sorry okay?
ALISON Yeah, because you were getting high off your huge bong.
ALISON How am I supposed to be comfortable with the idea that you can take care of me and the baby if you are always getting high?
BEN You want me to stop smoking pot because there's an earthquake once every ten years?
BEN That makes no sense, Alison.
BEN You're being irrational.
BEN Just relax.
BEN We're all scared.
BEN Oh, shit, the cops.
A cop car rolls by.
Ben throws his bong behind him and it SHATTERS on the payment.
BEN (CONT'D) California.
BEN (CONT'D) Hey!
Ben and Alison sort through the debris of porn, trash and weed among other things.
Alison finds Ben's bank statement that indicates he only has only
BEN You know it's times like this I'm glad I don't own nice things.
BEN It's a big mess, but there's only like fifty bucks worth of shit here.
BEN That's kind of the good thing.
BEN You know, my dad told me, "Don't move to Northridge."
BEN But you figure, what are the chances of that happening twice, you know?
Alison picks up a huge sword.
ALISON What is this?
BEN It's a ninja weapon.
BEN I hope this place doesn't get condemned.
BEN That would suck.
Alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought.
None of them have been read.
Alison sadly puts them back without Ben noticing.
Ben's phone RINGS.
BEN Hello?
Alison is at her desk at work.
ALISON Hey it's me.
BEN You!
ALISON Hi!
ALISON So, listen.
ALISON Will you do me a big favor?
ALISON Debbie wants us to come over and have dinner tonight.
ALISON She thinks Pete is cheating on her.
BEN Really?
ALISON Yeah.
ALISON Well, she saw one of his e-mails and there's an address.
ALISON Ugh.
BEN Oh, man.
BEN I don't want to do that.
ALISON Ben, come on.
BEN He's not cheating on her.
ALISON How do you know?
BEN I just know.
ALISON Are you sure?
BEN I'm one hundred percent sure he's not cheating.
ALISON Are you really?
BEN No.
BEN It actually kind of makes sense that he would cheat.
ALISON Why?
BEN Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and Pete's awesome?
ALISON Well, why don't you just come over then, and, we'll just diffuse the situation a little?
Alison, Ben, Pete and Debbie have dinner.
PETE I'm just saying the music industry is different now.
PETE Steely Dan would never even have a chance.
BEN Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan gargles my balls.
PETE They're incredible.
BEN They really aren't good, man.
PETE Old Steely Dan.
BEN If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want you to slice my head off with an Al Jarreau LP.
PETE I should get going.
PETE I'm supposed to see this band tonight in Hollywood.
PETE Actually, they're playing in Laurel Canyon, so I'll call you because the reception's terrible over there.
BEN That's true.
PETE And I don't want you to worry.
PETE I'm just going to jump in the shower.
PETE It would be terrible if I smelled worse than the band.
DEBBIE Okay.
DEBBIE Have fun.
Ben exits.
BEN You guys are crazy.
BEN He's acting totally normal and hilarious.
Debbie pulls up in front of the house in her car with Alison and Ben.
BEN She doesn't have a gun, does she?
ALISON No.
ALISON I don't think so.
BEN Oh, great.
Debbie tries the front door, it's unlocked.
They enter.
BEN Looks like no one's home.
DEBBIE Why was the door unlocked?
DEBBIE Wait here.
BEN I just feel bad for Pete.
ALISON What?
BEN I feel like this isn't a good way to get caught cheating, it shouldn't be like this.
ALISON Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he was cheating.
BEN Pete!
ALISON Stop it.
BEN I coughed.
BEN What do you want from me?
Debbie checks upstairs.
DEBBIE There's nobody up there.
BEN Thank you.
DEBBIE I guess I was wrong.
BEN I told you.
BEN Can we get out of here, please?
ALISON Yeah, come on.
ALISON Let's go.
A MURMUR comes from a far room.
DEBBIE Did you hear that?
ALISON What?
BEN I didn't hear anything.
ALISON Come on.
Debbie leads them into a room, where Pet sits with a lot of GUYS dressed in baseball clothing.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1 Ten seconds.
PETE Carlos Delgado.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2 Excellent choice.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2 Too bad I got him three rounds ago.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1 You're still on the clock.
PETE Oh shit!
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1 You gotta do something.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1 We need a name here.
PETE Hideki Matsui.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1 Ugh, you just took my whole outfield.
PETE Sorry, Charlie.
DEBBIE What is this?
PETE Debbie.
DEBBIE What the fuck is this?
PETE It's our fantasy baseball draft.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2 We said no wives.
DEBBIE Your fantasy what?
PETE It's, it's our draft...for fantasy baseball.
PETE I told you all about this.
PETE Got Matsui.
Debbie turns and walks out of the room.
PETE (CONT'D) Aw, shit.
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2 Hey, Pete, don't let the door hit you in the vagina on the way out!
FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2 Come on, who's going?
Pete and Debbie are in the driveway while Alison and Ben watch from the street.
I should have told you.
What else have you been lying about?
Nothing.
That guy said, "Don't let the door hit you in the vagina on the way out."
Where were you on Wednesday?
I'm going to be honest with you.
Yeah, I heard him.
That was hilarious.
That would be a good idea.
You've been mad because I've been working so much and I didn't want to upset you.
I wouldn't be mad.
You would be.
I don't get mad.
It's a fantasy baseball draft.
I'm not cheating or anything.
No, this is worse.
How is this worse?
This is you wanting to be with your friends more than your family.
Look, the reason I make that up is because if I told you what I was really doing, you would just get mad.
So, you think I'm seeing a band, I do my fantasy draft, and it's win/win.
DEBBIE Well, what did you do last Wednesday night when you said you went to see a band?
PETE I went to the movies.
DEBBIE With who?
PETE By myself.
DEBBIE What'd you see?
PETE "Spiderman Three."
DEBBIE Why do you want to go by yourself?
DEBBIE Why didn't you ask me to go?
PETE Because I needed to get away, you know?
PETE With work and you and the kids, sometimes I just need some time to myself.
DEBBIE I need time for myself.
DEBBIE I want time for myself, too.
Debbie holds back tears.
DEBBIE (CONT'D) You're not the only one.
PETE It's not that big of a deal.
DEBBIE I like Spiderman.
PETE Okay, so let's see "Spiderman Three" next week.
DEBBIE I don't want to go see it now.
PETE Well...
DEBBIE I don't want to have to ask you to ask me.
DEBBIE I want you to just come up with it on your own.
PETE What?
PETE I don't even know what to say.
PETE Uh, what do you want me to do?
DEBBIE You just think because you don't yell that you're not mean, but this is mean.
PETE I'm not being mean.
PETE I'm being honest.
PETE You're telling me I need to be honest.
DEBBIE No, you're not.
DEBBIE You're lying.
PETE I'm doing it because I need to keep my sanity a little bit.
DEBBIE You know what?
DEBBIE I don't want you at the house anymore.
DEBBIE Okay?
PETE Come on.
Debbie heads for the car.
BEN Oh, shit, she's coming back.
Alison drives to the gynecologist with Ben.
BEN How come we go to the gynecologist so often?
BEN I bet we have to go so much so we can pay for that three-hundred- thousand-dollar machine he has.
ALISON I cannot stop thinking about what an asshole Pete is.
BEN That's a little strong, I would say.
ALISON Really?
ALISON Because that had to be one of the most selfish things I've ever witnessed.
BEN It's understandable.
BEN I even think it's kind of funny.
ALISON What's funny about it?
BEN Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't imagine, but you know, the situation.
We break into this stranger's house thinking we're going to find him sleeping with a woman, and then it's a bunch of nerds playing fantasy baseball.If you saw that on television, you would laugh.
Is that what you think?
Yeah.
Is that what you want to do, Ben?
I don't even like baseball.
I'm just saying when you're a guy and you have a family and you have responsibility, you lose that male camaraderie, and I get that.
I totally understand where he's coming from.
Why do you guys always go to that place?
You miss male camaraderie.
What do I give a shit?
Go hang out with your bearded freak friends.
I don't care.
You want to hang out with guys that look like the Shoe Bomber, it's all on you, man.
Well what the fuck am I supposed to say to that?
You should just support me!
You know, you should just support everything I say because at this juncture in my life, I'm allowed to be wrong!
So if you're wrong, I have to support it?
Yes!
I can't tell you that you're acting like a lunatic?
Oh, that's helpful.
You have to do nothing!
I've sacrificed a lot of shit to this!
You are just fucking sitting there!
You haven't sacrificed anything!
BEN I have.
ALISON I've had to sacrifice my job, my body, my youth, my vagina!
BEN You've sacrificed your vagina?
ALISON Yes!
ALISON It will never look the same after this!
BEN Well.
BEN Fine.
BEN I'll pay for vaginal reconstructive surgery.
ALISON You can't pay for shit!
ALISON You can barely buy spaghetti.
BEN You're right.
BEN Fine!
ALISON You know what?
ALISON Get out of the car.
BEN Oh!
BEN You know what?
BEN Why don't you not threaten me?!
ALISON You should just get out of the fucking car.
BEN I'm not going to get out of the car in the middle of nowhere!
BEN No!
ALISON Get out of the car.
BEN No!
ALISON I own this car!
ALISON Get out of my car!
BEN No.
ALISON Get out of my car!
BEN No.
ALISON Get out of my fucking car!
Ben gets out of the car and immediately KNOCKS on the window.
BEN Can you let me back in the car, please?
BEN Have you calmed down?
BEN Did you take a breath?
BEN I have no clue where we are!
Alison just glares at him.
BEN (CONT'D) Fine.
BEN (CONT'D) Go.
BEN (CONT'D) Great.
Alison drives off.
Alison stands on a scale while DR.
HOWARD'S NURSE weighs her.
ALISON You know what?
ALISON Maybe I should take my shoes off.
ALISON Or my belt buckle.
ALISON My belt buckle's huge.
DR. HOWARD'S NURSE Don't worry about gaining weight.
DR. HOWARD'S NURSE Your baby wants you to gain a whole mess of weight.
Ben walks into the room, winded.
ALISON Are you fucking kidding me?
BEN Why don't you take off your earrings, too?
BEN They weigh about eighty pounds.
BEN They're made out of moon rocks aren't they?
ALISON Do not make fun of me.
ALISON Okay?
ALISON I am hormonal, I am terrified, and I am falling apart, so stop treating everything like it's a big joke!
BEN I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I just walked three fucking miles through Koreatown to get here.
BEN Sorry if I'm trying to lighten the mood a little.
The Nurse leaves.
ALISON Well, don't!
ALISON Okay?!
ALISON You can't take anything seriously!
ALISON You didn't even read the baby books.
BEN I didn't read the baby books!
BEN What's gonna happen?
BEN How did anyone ever give birth without a baby book?!
BEN (CONT'D) That's right, the ancient Egyptians fucking engraved "What to Expect When You're Expecting" on the pyramid walls!
BEN (CONT'D) I forgot about that!
BEN (CONT'D) Who gives a flying fuck about the baby books?!
ALISON It just shows your lack of commitment, Ben!
ALISON That you're not in this with me!
BEN Did you just say my lack of commitment?
BEN Because that's what it sounded like.
BEN It almost seems as though you forgot I proposed to you like an asshole!
BEN And you said no to me!
ALISON If you feel that way, you should just go.
ALISON Really.
ALISON Just go.
ALISON Because we didn't mean to do this together, okay?
ALISON And, and we tried to make it work and that was good, I suppose.
Alison holds back tears.
ALISON (CONT'D) But it doesn't work.
ALISON (CONT'D) Because we are two completely different people.
ALISON (CONT'D) And I think it would just be easier for both of us if we stop fooling ourselves.
BEN You know what?
BEN I know this isn't you talking, it's your hormones, but I would just like to say, "Fuck you, hormones!
BEN You are a crazy bitch, hormones!
BEN Not Alison!
BEN Hormones!" Fuck them.
BEN It's a girl.
BEN Buy some pink shit!
ALISON Nice.
ALISON You are such an asshole.
ALISON You know what?
ALISON Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck!
BEN I will fuck my bong.
BEN Doggie-style, for once.
Ben exits while giving Alison the finger as her walks away.
Dr.
Howard's Nurse returns.
DR. HOWARD'S NURSE Are you ready?
ALISON I'm really sorry about all that.
ALISON That was really inappropriate.
DR. HOWARD'S NURSE That's okay.
DR. HOWARD'S NURSE It happens all the time here.
DR. HOWARD'S NURSE It's fine.
ALISON I don't feel so stupid, then.
DR. HOWARD'S NURSE Not at all.
Establishing shot.
Ben and Pete drink at the bar.
BEN I totally know what you're talking about, man.
BEN If I wrote out the list of shit Alison doesn't let me do it would be endless.
BEN Don't smoke pot.
BEN Don't have samurai swords in your room.
BEN Don't have illegal grow operations in the house.
BEN I could go on all fucking day.
BEN Have I told her to stop doing anything ever?
BEN No.
PETE Marriage is like that show "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it's not funny.
PETE All the problems are the same, but it's...
PETE Instead of all the funny, pithy dialogue, everybody's just really pissed off and tense.
PETE Marriage is like an unfunny, tense version of "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it doesn't last twenty-two minutes.
PETE It lasts forever.
BEN Let's get out of here, man.
BEN Honestly, let's just go.
BEN Let's go to Vegas.
PETE Let's do it.
BEN Yeah.
PETE Why not?
Alison watches a pregnancy show on TV.
Debbie marches into the guest house.
DEBBIE Get up.
ALISON What?
DEBBIE We're not going to do this.
DEBBIE Seriously.
Debbie turns off the television.
ALISON What are you doing?
DEBBIE We have to do something!
DEBBIE And have fun!
ALISON I'm just so tired.
DEBBIE I know you're tired.
DEBBIE But we're going to be untired!
DEBBIE We're going to go live!
ALISON Ugh.
ALISON I hate you so much sometimes.
DEBBIE We're going to be positive.
ALISON How many Red Bulls have you had?
DEBBIE I've had about three Red Bulls in the last fifteen minutes.
DEBBIE And I feel fabulous!
DEBBIE We're going to create a new life and it's going to be awesome!
DEBBIE Let's go!
Ben and Pete KNOCK on the front door.
BEN Since when do we lock this fucking thing?
BEN Come on!
Jason opens the door with Jonah and Jay.
All of their eyes are very infected.
JASON Yo.
JASON We can't go, dude.
JASON Sorry.
BEN Holy crap!
BEN What happened?
JONAH We got pink eye.
BEN What?
BEN You giving each other butterfly kisses or something?
JASON Very funny.
JASON That's not how you get pink eye.
JASON You get it from poo particles making their way into your ocular cavities.
JAY Hey, Ben.
BEN Yo.
JAY How's it going?
JAY I farted on Jason's pillow as a practical joke.
JAY He farted on Jonah's, thinking it was mine.
JAY And then eventually pink-eyes my pillow.
JAY I'm not proud of this.
JAY But, I think we've all forgiven each other.
JAY But, we can't go anywhere.
PETE You can get pink eye from farting in a pillow?
JONAH Totally.
PETE That's awesome.
JONAH Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed.
Martin enters the doorway, his eyes are the worst.
BEN Jesus.
BEN Martin got it bad!
BEN What, did someone take a dump right in your eye?
MARTIN No.
MARTIN No pink eye for me.
MARTIN I'm just really...high.
BEN Well stay back, guys.
BEN I got to get my suit.
Ben enters the house and the guys pretend they're going to rub their faces on him.
Pete stays outside.
JASON Are you Debbie's husband?
PETE Yeah.
Jason shuts the door on Pete.
Pete drives with Ben to Vegas.
They are wearing suits.
BEN This is fun!
PETE This is great.
PETE We're going to have the best time ever.
BEN We make a good team, man.
PETE Yep.
PETE It's like I can't come here with Debbie.
PETE She doesn't understand.
PETE It's like she wants to hold me in, and she was telling Alison she could train you.
BEN She thinks she could train me?
PETE Yeah, like you're running the Triple Crown.
BEN She can't train this!
BEN I'm like Siegfried and Roy's Bengal.
BEN You think I'm trained.
BEN I'll bite your fucking face off.
PETE That's right.
BEN In front of a crowd, baby.
PETE This is better.
PETE Besides I don't know if I have enough of these babies to go around.
Pete brandishes a bag of mushrooms.
BEN Oh, my God.
BEN Are these mushrooms?
PETE I got them from a roadie for the Black Crowes.
BEN I'm eating them.
PETE Oh, no, save it!
PETE I got tickets to Cirque du Soleil.
BEN You do?!
BEN No you don't.
PETE I swear to God, man.
BEN Holy shit!
PETE I see the beam of light.
BEN There it is, baby.
PETE Woo-hoo.
PETE You're so money that you don't even know how much money you have.
Ben and Pete receive lap dances from topless strippers.
BEN I love Vegas, man.
PETE This is the greatest place on earth.
BEN It's really amazing here.
The stripper straddles Pete and pulls his tie through her legs so that he face is pulled against her butt.
PETE Whoa.
PETE You got my tie.
PETE This is awesome.
BEN Now that's how you get pink eye.
Debbie and Alison approach the nightclub, passing the line, straight to the DOORMAN.
The Doorman lets TWO PRETTY GIRLS past the rope.
DOORMAN Hey, what's up, baby girl?
Debbie and Alison move up to the doorman.
DEBBIE Hi.
DOORMAN What's up?
DOORMAN End of the line, please.
DEBBIE Really?
DOORMAN Yeah.
DEBBIE Oh, come on.
DOORMAN Look, we're at capacity, okay?
DOORMAN We'll let some people in when it clears out a little.
DOORMAN You'll get right in if you go back to the end of the line.
DEBBIE We come here all the time.
DEBBIE It's not a big deal.
DEBBIE It doesn't really look that crowded in there.
DOORMAN Hey, look, I don't make the rules.
DEBBIE Please?
DOORMAN No.
TWO CUTE GIRLS approach.
The Doorman lifts the rope for them.
DOORMAN (CONT'D) Hey, what's up, shorty?
DOORMAN (CONT'D) What's up pretty girls?
DOORMAN (CONT'D) See y'all when y'all get out.
DOORMAN (CONT'D) Take care of yourself.
DEBBIE What was that?
DEBBIE What the fuck was that?
DOORMAN It is what it is, sweetie.
DOORMAN Now can you step to the back, please?
ALISON You know what?
ALISON Maybe we should just go.
DEBBIE You don't need to call me sweetie.
DOORMAN Yeah, but maybe you should listen to your friend.
DEBBIE No, you don't need to call me sweetie.
DOORMAN All right, you want to come in, you're going to have to go to the end of the line and wait like everybody else.
DEBBIE I'm not going to go to the end of the fucking line.
DEBBIE Who the fuck are you?
DEBBIE I have just as much of a right to be here as any of these little skanky girls!
DEBBIE What, am I not skanky enough for you?!
DEBBIE You want me to hike up my fucking skirt?!
DEBBIE What the fuck is your problem?!
DEBBIE I'm not going anywhere!
DEBBIE You're just some `roided out freak with a fucking clipboard.
DEBBIE And your stupid little fucking rope!
DEBBIE You may have power now, but you're not God.
DEBBIE You're a doorman!
DEBBIE Okay?
DEBBIE You're a doorman!
DEBBIE So...fuck you, you fucking fag with your fucking little faggy gloves.
The Doorman grabs Debbie and takes her aside.
DOORMAN Come here, come on.
The Doorman takes Debbie aside.
DOORMAN I know.
DOORMAN You're right.
DOORMAN I'm so sorry.
DOORMAN I fucking hate this job.
DOORMAN I don't want to be the one to pass judgement and decide who gets in.
DOORMAN This shit makes me sick to my stomach.
DOORMAN I get the runs from the stress.
DOORMAN It's not because you're not hot.
DOORMAN I would love to tap that ass.
DOORMAN I would tear that ass up.
DOORMAN I can't let you in because you're old as fuck...for this club, not, you know, for the earth.
DEBBIE What?
DOORMAN You old.
DOORMAN She pregnant.
DOORMAN Can't have a bunch of old, pregnant bitches running around.
DOORMAN That's crazy.
DOORMAN I'm only allowed to let in five percent black people.
DOORMAN He said that.
DOORMAN Five percent.
DOORMAN That mean if there's twenty-five people here, I get to let in one-and-a-quarter black people.
DOORMAN So I got to hope there's a black midget in the crowd.
DEBBIE Now I feel guilty.
DEBBIE I'm sorry.
DOORMAN Why y'all want to be in here anyway?
DOORMAN Y'all need to be at a yoga class or something.
DOORMAN What the fuck is she doing at the club?
DOORMAN That's not even good parenting right there.
DOORMAN Your old ass should know better than that.
DEBBIE Oh, God.
DEBBIE Ugh.
Debbie takes Alison away.
Ben and Pete hold neon yard glasses and walk past numerous swimsuit-clad men and women.
BEN Have the mushrooms kicked in yet?
Ben and Pete CHUCKLE uncontrollably.
Establishing shot.
Ben and Pete watch from the crowd as acrobats climb poles.
BEN AND PETE Ohhhhhh!
BEN This was a great idea, man.
PETE This is the best idea I've ever had in my life.
Two bare-chested male acrobats start to balance on top of each other.
BEN What are they going to do?
BEN What in the world are they doing?
BEN If I shaved my stomach and my chest, I would look exactly like that.
BEN Those guys are at work right now.
BEN (imitating one of the
ACROBATS) What'd you do today?
ACROBATS) Oh, just lifted my brother.
The crowd starts to APPLAUD for the acrobats.
BEN (CONT'D) No!
BEN (CONT'D) Don't applaud!
BEN (CONT'D) He'll fall!
BEN (CONT'D) I'm freaking out right now, man!
Many acrobats in devilish outfits take the stage.
BEN (CONT'D) The mushrooms are turning on me!
A clown dressed as a GIANT BABY is part of the act.
Ben YELLS frantically.
GIANT BABY Papa.
BEN I am not your papa.
A giant Snail comes out onto the stage.
BEN (CONT'D) I can't deal with this shit, man!
Ben stands up and runs down the aisle towards the exit.
Debbie and Alison sit on the curb.
DEBBIE It's over.
ALISON What's over?
DEBBIE My youth.
ALISON Don't say that.
DEBBIE It's true.
DEBBIE I just want to dance.
DEBBIE I love dancing.
ALISON So dance.
DEBBIE I can't dance.
DEBBIE I'm embarrassed.
ALISON I should be embarrassed.
ALISON I'm a fucking whale and I'm trying to get into some stupid club and--
DEBBIE You look beautiful.
DEBBIE You're young and you're tall and you got the good lips and boobs.
DEBBIE I'm going to be alone.
ALISON Debbie, no, you're not.
DEBBIE Yes, I am.
DEBBIE Oh, God!
DEBBIE Fucking, men!
DEBBIE I get worse looking and he gets better looking, and it's so fucking unfair.
DEBBIE Oh, fuck.
DEBBIE We should go.
DEBBIE My babysitter always gets mad when we come home past twelve.
DEBBIE She's such a pissy little high- school cunt.
Ben curls up on the bed with his shirt and boxers on.
A scene from "CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN" plays on the television.
Steve Martin juggles all of his children.
STEVE MARTIN Let's move, gang!
STEVE MARTIN Come on, come on, come on!
STEVE MARTIN Jessica, can you get these plates and put them on the table, please?!
BEN This isn't funny.
BEN That guy has twelve kids.
BEN It's not funny.
BEN This is sick.
BEN This is a sick movie.
BEN That's a lot of responsibility to be joking about.
BEN That's not funny.
BEN I got to turn this off.
BEN It's freaking me out.
Pete moves several chairs into the bedroom.
PETE There are five different types of chairs in this hotel room.
BEN Holy fuck.
BEN What are they all doing in here?
PETE These are five different types of chair.
BEN Get them out of here, man.
BEN This is too many chairs for one room.
PETE There's a guy that works for this hotel.
PETE His whole job is to find chairs.
Pete moves to a tall chair.
PETE (CONT'D) Look at this one.
PETE (CONT'D) Look at it.
PETE (CONT'D) It's gold and red and it's kind of shiny.
PETE (CONT'D) Shiny thread?
PETE (CONT'D) Unbelievable.
PETE (CONT'D) It is beautiful, and it feels amazing.
BEN The tall one's gawking at me and the short one's being very droll.
BEN I don't like them.
Pete switches to another chair.
PETE Oh, wow!
BEN It's weird that chairs even exist when you're not sitting on them.
Pete switched to another tall chair.
PETE I'm up high!
PETE I'm really high up.
BEN I should've read the baby books.
PETE Why didn't you read the baby books?
BEN Because then it's real, you know?
PETE Dude, it's real whether or not you read those books.
PETE That baby's coming.
Pete sits on another chair.
PETE (CONT'D) Oh, man!
BEN Think they'll take us back?
PETE Yes.
PETE But I don't know why.
PETE Do you ever wonder how somebody could even like you?
BEN All the time, man.
BEN Like every day.
BEN I wonder how you like me.
PETE How can Debbie like me?
PETE She likes me.
PETE I mean, she loves me.
PETE The biggest problem in our marriage is that she wants me around.
PETE She loves me so much that she wants me around all the time.
PETE That's our biggest problem.
PETE And I can't even accept that?
PETE Uh, like that upsets me?!
Ben sits up from the bed.
BEN What?
PETE She's the one.
PETE She loves me.
BEN You can't believe...that people love you?
BEN I love you, man!
BEN Debbie loves you!
PETE I don't think I can accept her love.
PETE There's something wrong with me.
BEN You can't accept love?
PETE I don't know what it is.
BEN Love?
BEN The most beautiful, shiny, warmy thing in the world?
BEN You can't accept it?
PETE I have to go to this other chair.
Pete switches to a new chair.
PETE (CONT'D) Oh, this is a better energy.
BEN You can't accept pure love?
BEN You can't accept Debbie?
BEN She's chosen to give you her life.
BEN She's picked you as her life partner!
BEN But you play fantasy baseball because you can't accept her love?
Ben BURPS.
BEN (CONT'D) Ugh.
BEN (CONT'D) I could accept it, man.
BEN (CONT'D) And Debbie's amazing, man.
BEN (CONT'D) She's cool and she's funny and she smells good and she's nice and her hair always looks different.
BEN (CONT'D) She's too good for you, man.
Pete shoves his hand in his mouth.
PETE Tastes like a rainbow.
BEN You're disgusting.
BEN You're an urchin.
BEN And she busts your balls because you're a little bitch!
BEN You're a filthy bitch!
BEN And I'd bust your balls!
BEN Debbie wants to give her life to you and Alison doesn't want to do that with me.
BEN And it makes me sad all day.
BEN I want to go home.
PETE I want to go home, too.
Establishing shot.
Debbie and Alison set up Sadie's princess birthday party.
ALISON Everything looks beautiful.
DEBBIE Thanks.
DEBBIE I went kind of overboard, huh?
ALISON No, it's great.
DEBBIE Your daughter only turns eight once.
DEBBIE Is Ben going to come?
ALISON I don't think so.
ALISON I don't know why he would.

He wears a button-down shirt and long khaki shorts.
He KNOCKS on the door.
Sadie opens the door.
BEN Oh, hey, what up dog?
SADIE Where have you been?
BEN Around.
BEN You know, just kind of doing my thing.
SADIE Why is everybody so mad at you?
BEN I don't know.
BEN Are they mad?
BEN What have they been saying?
SADIE They've been saying, like "blah-blah- blah-blah.
SADIE Ben's a prick."
BEN They said that?
SADIE A lot.
BEN That sucks.
SADIE What does it mean?
BEN Penis.

BEN Hey, Debbie.
DEBBIE How are you?
BEN Good.
BEN How are you?
Ben and Debbie kiss hello.
DEBBIE Hi.
DEBBIE Did you just get pink cupcakes or yellow and pink cupcakes?
PETE I just got yellow cupcakes.
DEBBIE I thought I said to get pink cupcakes.
PETE I can run out.
PETE I'll get some more.
DEBBIE Nah, it's no big deal.
PETE I don't mind.
DEBBIE No it doesn't matter.
PETE You sure?
DEBBIE Yeah.
DEBBIE You look really cute in that.
Pete and Debbie kiss.
Debbie exits.
BEN Well, that was fast, you pussy.
PETE You're the one that got dressed up like a cholo on Easter to come to this party.
BEN How are things at Butt-Fucking-Ham Palace?
PETE You look like Babe Ruth's gay brother, Gabe Ruth.
BEN Well played, sir.
BEN That was good.
PETE You going to talk to Alison?
BEN Yeah, I was about to.
PETE Right on.
Ben hands Pete his gift for Sadie.
BEN It's a doll.
PETE Thanks, Ben.
Alison and Ben talk off to the side.
ALISON I just don't think we can make it work.
BEN We can get back on track and everything's going to be great.
ALISON You're just being nice.
ALISON And I'm being nice and just because we're two nice people doesn't mean we should stay together.
ALISON I don't want this baby to determine the rest of our lives.
ALISON You know?
ALISON Me not wanting to do this alone isn't enough of a reason to drag you into a relationship with me.
ALISON It's just not fair.
ALISON And, and don't repeat this, but, God, I don't want to end up like Debbie.
BEN But Debbie's happy.
ALISON She's happy today.
ALISON But every day is a constant struggle for them because they're not right for each other.
ALISON You know?
ALISON And they have to force it and I don't want us to have to do that.
ALISON I don't want to force you to be what I think you should be.
ALISON That's wrong of me because you're great.
ALISON You really are.
ALISON You're great the way you are and, I mean, you like to get high and you like to do shrooms in Vegas.
BEN I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.
ALISON And who am I to stop you?
ALISON Who am I to tell you that that's wrong?
ALISON It's not wrong.
ALISON It's who you are.
ALISON It's what you enjoy and that's your life and...
BEN I'm not that guy anymore.
ALISON We can be friends.
ALISON And you can be there when the baby is born, and in the baby's life as much as you want.
ALISON I hope you will be.
BEN If you give me a shot to just show you that I'm con--
Debbie approaches.
DEBBIE Excuse me?
BEN Oh, shit.
DEBBIE Can you grab the video camera?
DEBBIE We're going to sing "Happy Birthday" now.
ALISON Yeah.
ALISON I'm sorry.
ALISON I got to go.
ALISON I'm sorry.
BEN It's okay.
ALISON I'll be right back.
ALISON We'll finish talking.
Ben stomps back into the kitchen.
Pete is carrying the birthday cake.
PETE What happened?
BEN Thanks for warning me, man.
BEN I just walking into a fucking buzz saw!
BEN She rejected me!
BEN Because you, for some insane reason, told Debbie that I did mushrooms with you in Vegas!
BEN She gets mad because I smoke pot!
BEN (CONT'D) Now I'm upping it to fucking psychedelics!
BEN (CONT'D) Thanks!
PETE Really?
PETE I thought that she'd take you back.
BEN You know why she just rejected me?
BEN Because you're such a shitty husband, she thinks I'm going to turn into a shitty husband!

BEN Nothing is fine.
HARRIS Ben, I've been divorced three times.
HARRIS Why would you listen to me?
BEN Because you were the only one giving me advice!
BEN And it was, it was terrible advice!
HARRIS You can go around blaming everyone else, but in the end, until you take responsibility for yourself, none of this is going to work out.
BEN I don't know how to take responsibility for myself, okay?
BEN I didn't read the baby books!
HARRIS You didn't read the books?
BEN I should smoke less pot.
BEN I don't know what to do!
BEN I'm an idiot!
BEN What, tell me what to do!

HARRIS I don't know.

JACK From my count, you're right around eight months.
JACK And I don't know why you felt you couldn't tell us.
ALISON I'm really sorry.
JILL This is Hollywood.
JILL We don't like liars.
ALISON I just wasn't expecting this and, I didn't know how to handle it, and I didn't want to lose my job.
ALISON I'm really sorry.
JACK It's unfortunate that you didn't tell us because you would've found out that we thought it's great.
Really?
Yeah.
So, we did some research.
And turns out, people like pregnant.
Oh, my God!
The bigger you are, the bigger your numbers.
I was surprised because I feel the opposite.
We're going to do a whole maternity month on "E, Exclamation, Mommy."
You're going to interview all the pregnant celebs.
Really?
Yes.
Scary!
If you're pregnant, they're pregnant, you can talk about being pregnant.
It just grosses me out...when I know that people are pregnant.
Because I think about the birth.
Everything's so wet.
And everything that goes into it.
None of the gross stuff.
But you know, hopes, dreams, whatever.
It's going to be great.
Oh, my God.
This is such good news.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
And then, after the baby is out, tighten it back up.

BEN No.
BEN I'm going to pack it in soon.

ALISON Can you help me find him?
ALISON Can you give me his number?
DR. ANGELO Oh, no.
DR. ANGELO You know what?
DR. ANGELO Actually, I'm under strict instructions not give out his number, but I can help you through this.
ALISON No, no, no, no.

DR. ANGELO Dr. Howard is not available tonight.
DR. ANGELO Bet everything's going to be okay, I assure you.

BEN Hello?
ALISON Ben?
BEN Alison.
BEN What is this, like a water birth?
BEN What are we doing?
BEN Should we go?
ALISON Shh!
ALISON Just relax, okay?
ALISON Just be mellow, because that's what this is all about.
ALISON Because if it gets too stressful in here then the baby is born into a stressful environment and then he's wired for stress for the rest of his life.
ALISON So just...just be calm.
BEN Okay.
BEN Okay.
BEN Let's relax.
BEN Do you want to talk about things?
BEN I feel really bad about a lot of the shit I did.
BEN I can't believe I said some of that.
BEN That's all I think about in my head.
ALISON I don't want to talk about it.

BEN (CONT'D) I'm going to call him right now.
ALISON Great.
ALISON Thank you so much.
ALISON I'm so glad you're here.
ALISON Thank you.
BEN I'm glad I'm here, too.
BEN Thank you.
BEN I shouldn't have told you you were a fucking lunatic.
BEN I shouldn't have said that.
BEN I feel terrible about it.
ALISON No, it's okay.
ALISON We're past it.
ALISON I'm sorry I told you to fuck your bong.
BEN It's okay.
BEN I didn't
ALISON Let's just drop it now.
ALISON We're over it.
BEN I'm going to call him right now.
BEN You're doing so great.
Ben slips into the hallway and calls Dr. Howard.

DR. HOWARD I'm not here right now.
DR. HOWARD Please leave a message.
BEN Hey, Doc Howard.
BEN Ben Stone calling.
BEN Guess what the fuck's up?
BEN Alison's going into labor and you are not fucking here.
BEN Now, where are you?
BEN You're at a fucking Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco, you motherfucking piece of shit!
BEN And you know I'm going to have to do now?
BEN I'm going to have to kill you.
BEN I'm going to have to pop a cap in your ass.
BEN You're dead!
BEN You're Tupac!
BEN You are fucking Biggie, you piece of shit!
BEN I hope you fucking die or drop the fucking chair and kill that fucking kid!
BEN Hope your plane crashes.
BEN Peace, fucker!
Ben goes back to Alison.
ALISON Hey.
BEN Hey.
ALISON Did you talk to him?
BEN I didn't talk to him directly, I left him a very nice message, though.
BEN What I'm about to tell you isn't that bad.
BEN You should know that going in.
BEN We can get through this and it's just a little hiccup, but everything will be fine.
BEN Do you trust me when I say everything will be fine?
I can deal with it.
Okay.
So, Dr. Howard is at a Bar Mitzvah.
A Bar Mitzvah?
It's a Jewish rite of passage.
And he's going to be there for the next three days, so he will not be able to be here tonight.
It's okay.
What do you think we should do?
I know exactly what to do.
All we do is we'll get in the car, I'll drive to the hospital, and on the way, we will call every gynecologist we've met.
Someone will be available.
You know?
I can do that.
Good.
We still have time.
I mean, how far apart are your contractions?
I think, like, seven minutes.
Seven minutes!
See?
Not until four minutes is it really coming.
And has your water broken, even?
I don't know.
I'm in the tub.
That's a good point.
Have you had, have you had your bloody show?
What's that?
It's a bloody mucusy discharge.
But it only comes out right before the baby's going to come, so if that hasn't happened, we have time.
We can make it to the hospital.
It's no problem.
You read the baby books.
Yeah.
I did.
I read three of them, actually.
ALISON Thank you.
BEN You're welcome.
Ben drives Alison's car.
They park in a handicapped spot.
ALISON Wait.
ALISON Are we allowed to park here?
BEN It's okay.
Ben takes a handicapped placard out of his jacket pocket and hangs it on the mirror.
BEN (CONT'D) I stole this from Martin's grandma.
ALISON Oh.
ALISON That was really sweet of you.
BEN Thanks.
Alison and Ben approach the desk.
A male nurse, SAMUEL, and a FEMALE NURSE tend to them.
BEN We're close.
BEN Home stretch.
BEN Hello.
BEN This is Alison Scott.
BEN Dr. Kuni said he would let you know we were coming?
FEMALE NURSE He did.
FEMALE NURSE We'll take good care of you.
FEMALE NURSE Samuel?
SAMUEL Yeah?
FEMALE NURSE This is Alison Scott.
FEMALE NURSE Please admit her into room 307.
SAMUEL All right.
SAMUEL Hi.
BEN You're our nurse?
SAMUEL That's why I'm holding the clipboard.
SAMUEL So, uh, what else is up with you guys?
Ben and Alison stare at Samuel.
SAMUEL (CONT'D) I'm just joking.
SAMUEL (CONT'D) Let's have a baby!
Samuel is adjusting Alison's IV.
SAMUEL So, I'm sorry it took me so long to find that vein.
SAMUEL That little guy really didn't want me to find him.
ALISON Is that the baby on that one right there?
Alison points to some equipment by her bed side.
SAMUEL Yeah.
SAMUEL That's how we can tell how the little guy or gal is doing.
ALISON Okay.
A groggy Dr. Kuni enters.
DR. KUNI Hello, Alison, Ben.
DR. KUNI Interesting night.
BEN We really, really appreciate you coming, man.
DR. KUNI What else do I have to do, I mean, besides sleep?
DR. KUNI I was only kidding.
DR. KUNI What happened to your doctor?
BEN He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco.
BEN He didn't tell us though.
DR. KUNI Nice.
BEN Yeah.
DR. KUNI Lucky for you I don't have any Jewish friends.
ALISON Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this naturally.
ALISON I don't want to use drugs.
DR. KUNI Let's just take a look and see what happens, okay?
DR. KUNI Fetal heart rate is good.
DR. KUNI Samuel, where are we?
SAMUEL Four centimeters.
DR. KUNI Four centimeters what?
SAMUEL Dilated.
DR. KUNI Dilated.
DR. KUNI That's right.
DR. KUNI Focus.
DR. KUNI Pay attention, okay?
DR. KUNI We're a team.
DR. KUNI Okay?
Jonah, Jason, Jay and Martin sit in the waiting room.
JONAH I want to get the fuck out of here.
JAY What?
JONAH I just want to get the fuck out of here.
JAY Just relax, man, just relax.
JONAH I don't fucking like hospitals.
JAY Jonah, this is beautiful.
JAY I just think you need to relax and embrace the beauty of another life joining our gang.
JAY We're having a baby.
JAY We are having a baby.
JONAH I'm not having shit besides a fucking panic attack.
JONAH There's probably a fucking room back there full of dead bodies!
JONAH You guys want to be here when one rolls out and just fucking coughs malaria into our face?
JAY Jesus.
JONAH Fucking shit.
Ben massages Alison's back.
BEN Is that good?
ALISON Oh, yeah, get in there.
BEN I could do this all day.
The fetal heart monitors begins to BEEP.
ALISON What was that?
BEN What the hell was that?
Samuel hurries in to check the monitor.
BEN (CONT'D) What's that, what's happening?
Dr. Kuni enters.
DR. KUNI Well, boy and girls, what seems to be the problem?
SAMUEL Decels.
DR. KUNI Oh, dear.
DR. KUNI Okay.
DR. KUNI Alison, I need you to turn on your back now, okay?
DR. KUNI The baby's heart rate is slowing.
DR. KUNI Okay?
BEN It's going to be okay.
BEN Is it going to be fine?
Alison turns onto her back.
DR. KUNI It's going to be fine.
DR. KUNI Okay?
DR. KUNI You're going to feel a little bit of a push.
Dr. Kuni tries to reposition the baby.
BEN What are you doing?
DR. KUNI I'm turning the baby so I can take the pressure off the cord.
ALISON Oh, my God.
The monitors stops beeping.
DR. KUNI We're good.
DR. KUNI The heartbeat's stronger, but we're not out of the woods.
DR. KUNI We need to get things going now.
DR. KUNI I think the cord is wrapped around the neck.
DR. KUNI Okay?
BEN What?
DR. KUNI So I'm going to give you some medicine, pop the bag and get things going, okay?
DR. KUNI I don't want to leave the baby in there for long and we can give you some medicine for the pain.
ALISON No, no, no, no.
ALISON I don't want the baby to be born all drugged out.
ALISON It's not my birth plan.
DR. KUNI Now, things change.
DR. KUNI We don't have time to debate this.
ALISON What?
ALISON No.
ALISON But no, I'm not comfortable with that.
ALISON I'm not.
BEN No.
BEN Would you please just listen to her?
DR. KUNI Fine.
DR. KUNI Do what you want to do.
BEN Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
DR. KUNI Should I leave?
DR. KUNI Do you want to be the doctor?
DR. KUNI Because I really don't need to be here.
BEN No.
BEN What we want is to take a second to talk about our options, okay?
BEN That's all we want.
DR. KUNI No.
DR. KUNI You mean you want to take a second to tell me how to do my job.
DR. KUNI My job is to get that baby out safely.
DR. KUNI Or I can go home!
DR. KUNI You just let me know.
DR. KUNI You be the doctor.
BEN Can we talk outside in the hall for a second?
Ben and Dr. Kuni stand in the hallway.
DR. KUNI That woman is a control freak, and she needs to let go and let me do my job.
BEN Look, she's just having a hard time because her and her doctor had a very specific birth plan.
BEN And they wanted it to be a very special experience.
DR. KUNI Okay.
DR. KUNI if you want a special experience, go to a Jimmy Buffet concert.
DR. KUNI We have a new birth plan: Get the baby out safely.
BEN Look, man, will you help us out?
BEN I have no idea what I'm doing.
BEN You can be as big a dick to me as you want.
BEN Just be nice to her, man.
BEN That's all I ask.
BEN Just please be nice to her.
Ben's stomach GROWLS loudly.
DR. KUNI Are you okay?
BEN I think so.
DR. KUNI I'm sorry.
DR. KUNI Let's start fresh.
BEN Thank you, man.
DR. KUNI This is healthy.
DR. KUNI This is good.
DR. KUNI I think we're bonding.
Dr. Kuni and Ben come back into the room.
DR. KUNI Alison, I apologize for being a little brash, but if you're okay with it, it's rather important we break the bag and give you some medicine to speed things up.
DR. KUNI Because once the bag is broken, I don't want there to be an infection.
ALISON Whatever.
ALISON Do what you have to do.
Dr. Kuni exits.
ALISON (CONT'D) Oh, my God.
ALISON (CONT'D) What a nightmare that guy is.
BEN I know, I know.
BEN Look, I talked to him.
BEN I think he'll be more cool now.
ALISON I'm so sorry I broke up with you.
BEN You really don't need to be.
BEN And you know, I knew you'd give me another shot.
BEN I figured it'd be a lot sooner than this, you know?
ALISON I was just in such a panic from all of this.
ALISON And watching Debbie and Pete together, and my ass got so fat.
BEN No, no.
ALISON It did.
ALISON I just never, for one minute, thought that the guy who got me pregnant would actually be the right guy for me.
BEN Me neither.
ALISON I guess he is.
Martin and Jonah wheel around the corner in wheelchairs.
JONAH All right, Martin, who am I?
HAWKING) People think I'm smart because I speak in a robot voice.
MARTIN Stephen Hawking.
HAWKING) I fuck my nurse with my ever-expanding cock.
HAWKING) All right.
HAWKING) Let's murderball.
HAWKING) Come here!
HAWKING) I'm going to murderball you!
Jonah kicks Martin's wheelchair over.
MARTIN Oh, fuck.
JONAH Stay down!
MARTIN Jonah, you shithead!
Debbie and Pete come into the room.
Pete holds a camcorder.
DEBBIE Hi.
DEBBIE I can't believe I go out of town and this happens.
ALISON I know.
DEBBIE I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere.
ALISON Screw Legoland.
PETE All right, how do you want this?
PETE You want this over the shoulder?
PETE I can do whatever you want.
PETE I can get in there.
PETE Kind of Spike Lee angles.
ALISON No, you can shoot the waiting room.
ALISON That would be great.
DEBBIE Well, thank you.
DEBBIE I've got it from here.
ALISON Debbie.
BEN Can I talk to you in the hall for a second?
DEBBIE Why?
Ben and Debbie talk in the hallway alone.
BEN I'd like to be in there with Alison...without you.
DEBBIE Okay.
DEBBIE I understand how you feel, but this isn't up to you.
BEN Look, Debbie, you are high off your ass if you think you're coming into that room.
BEN If you take one step towards that door, I will tell security there's a crazy chick in a pink dress snatching up babies.
BEN Okay?
BEN So don't even try to come into that room.
BEN That's my room now.
BEN That little area with the Pepsi machine...that's your area.
BEN My room.
BEN Your area.
BEN Stay in your area.
BEN Stay out of my room.
BEN Back the fuck off.
Debbie sits down in a seat next to Pete.
PETE What are you doing here?
DEBBIE He just kicked me out.
DEBBIE He told me to leave.
DEBBIE But I guess it's good, right?
DEBBIE He said he's going to take care of her.
DEBBIE He really seems on his game.
DEBBIE I think he's going to be a good dad.
DEBBIE I think I like him.
DEBBIE Thank God.
PETE I wish I'd gotten that on tape.
Alison is in labor.
She is PANTING.
ALISON Go!
ALISON Holy shit, almighty!
ALISON Oh, shit, this really hurts!
DR. KUNI Ah, I see we're well on our way.
ALISON I want the epidural!
ALISON Okay?
ALISON Give me the epidural!
BEN Give it to her.
BEN Give her the epidural, okay?
ALISON Okay?
BEN Give it to her now.
DR. KUNI Alison, we're past the point of an epidural.
DR. KUNI The cervix is fully dilated.
ALISON No, seriously, I want an epidural!
ALISON I know there's time!
DR. KUNI We can't give you the epidural.
ALISON Take the time!
ALISON I'll make sure it doesn't come out!
ALISON I'll stop pushing.
BEN We have time.
ALISON I'll stop, oh, please, please, please!
BEN Just do it, please!
DR. KUNI I'm sorry.
DR. KUNI We have no time.
DR. KUNI We're going to just have to do this the all natural way, okay?
DR. KUNI The way you wanted to do it.
DR. KUNI Okay?
DR. KUNI Ready?
ALISON Okay.
DR. KUNI Here comes another contraction, okay?
DR. KUNI I want you to push.
DR. KUNI Okay, ready?
DR. KUNI Good, good, good.
ALISON I feel everything!
ALISON Oh, my God!
ALISON It's happening.
SAMUEL Maybe we can take it down just a little.
SAMUEL I think you're going to scare the other pregnant women.
ALISON Are you fucking kidding me?
ALISON Are you kidding me?
Alison's SHRIEKING is heard in the waiting room.
JAY Jesus.
JONAH Oh.
JONAH This is messed up.
JONAH Something's wrong in there.
JASON No, no.
JASON I mean, granted, gynecology's only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to me like she's crowning.
JASON Is that right, Deb?
DEBBIE Yeah.
DEBBIE That's what it sounds like for everyone.
DEBBIE Everyone goes through this.
JAY No, I disagree with you.
JAY That sounds terrible.
JAY I'm going to go sneak a peek, see if there's anything I can do.
Jay goes to Alison's room.
Alison is in agony.
Ben, Dr. Kuni and nurses are hunched around her.
DR. KUNI It's crowning!
DR. KUNI I'm seeing the head!
ALISON Oh, God.
ALISON Honey, what does it look like, Ben?
Been peers down between Alison's legs.
We actually see the crowning shot as the baby's head is being pushed out of Alison's vagina.
BEN Oh, God.
ALISON What?
BEN You don't want to see it.
BEN You don't
ALISON No, I want to see it!
BEN It's beautiful.
BEN You don't want to, though.
ALISON No, I want to see...
A nurse holds a mirror for Alison.
She sees the actual crowning shot.
ALISON (CONT'D) ...it!
ALISON (CONT'D) Oh, God!
ALISON (CONT'D) Oh, God!
DR. KUNI Okay, we're almost home!
DR. KUNI One, two--
Jay bursts in.
JAY You okay in here?
Jay sees the crowning shot.
JAY (CONT'D) Jesus!
ALISON Get out!
JAY Yeah, okay.
Jay solemnly returns to his chair.
JASON You all right, buddy?
JAY One sec.
JONAH What did it look like?
JAY I shouldn't have gone in there.
JAY Don't go in there.
JAY Promise me you don't go in there.
JONAH Me go in there?
JONAH That's the last fucking place I want to go.
JONAH Like I'm going to go in there.
JONAH Try getting a boner now.
Jason beams at Debbie.
JASON What's up Deb?
DEBBIE Hey.
Pete looks at Debbie.
The birth is still in progress.
DR. KUNI Push.
DR. KUNI One, two, three.
ALISON Oh, God!
DR. KUNI You've passed the shoulders.
DR. KUNI One more big push.
DR. KUNI Good.
The baby comes out.
Dr. Kuni cleans it up.
ALISON Oh, Ben.
ALISON I did it.
BEN You did it.
ALISON It's out.
BEN You did it.
BEN Oh, my God, you did it.
Dr. Kuni hands the baby to Alison.
ALISON Hi, baby.
ALISON I love you, Ben.
BEN I love you so much, too.
BEN Oh, my God.
DR. KUNI Congratulations, you two.
DR. KUNI Beautiful.
ALISON Thank you.
DR. KUNI You did so great.
DR. KUNI You were amazing.
ALISON Pretty baby.
BEN You got out.
BEN You made it out.
BEN Welcome.
MARTIN You ever get so bored you just stare at your balls?
JONAH I bet you do, late John Lennon.
MARTIN Here we go again.
DEBBIE Who is that?
DEBBIE Is that Ben's rabbi?
DEBBIE Is he the one who cuts the penis?
PETE I think it's Matisyahu.
MARTIN Awesome.
JASON You want out of the bet?
MARTIN I want out of the bet.
JASON You know what you have to say.
JASON Just say it, man.
JASON I think now is the time.
MARTIN "Jason, you're the master."
JASON You heard it, right?
JAY Yeah.
JASON All right.
JASON You're out of the bet.
JASON You're done.
Martin hugs Jason.
JASON (CONT'D) Your face smells like an old man's balls.
MARTIN Thank you.
Debbie and Pete come to check in on Alison.
DEBBIE Oh, my God.
DEBBIE Hello.
DEBBIE My goodness.
DEBBIE She's beautiful.
DEBBIE She's beautiful.
DEBBIE I love you, Ben.
BEN I love you, Debbie.
DEBBIE We're going to have another baby.
PETE Okay.
Pete turns the camera on himself and shakes his head "no."
DEBBIE Hello, baby.
Ben enters the waiting room to talk to the guys.
BEN Gentlemen, it's a girl!
THE GUYS Ohhhhhhh!
BEN Yeah!
They all hug.
JAY We got a daughter!
JAY Mazel Tov!
JASON Congratulations, Daddy!
JAY We got a beautiful little girl!
BEN Let's meet her!
BEN She's awesome.
JAY A beautiful little girl!
JASON Let's meet her.
JASON Aw.
Alison sleeps while Ben holds the baby.
Everyone else has gone home.
BEN And then your mommy said, "Just do it, already," which was very confusing to Daddy.
BEN So I listened to the most literal translation of that and I just did it, already.
BEN What would you do?
BEN Don't tell Mommy, but it was the smartest thing I ever did, listening to her, because now you're here.
BEN Isn't that nice?
BEN I think it is.
Ben and a Nurse push Alison and the baby in a wheelchair.
Ben drives while Alison and the baby are in the back seat.
ALISON I hope your apartment's big enough for the three of us.
BEN It definitely is.
BEN That's why I got one in East LA.
BEN The rent.
BEN It's huge!
BEN The only thing is we have to decide if we're going to be Crips or Bloods before we get there.
ALISON Well, I look good in red.
BEN I look good in blue.
BEN The fighting continues.
BEN We could just throw off everyone and become Latin Kings.
ALISON Yeah.
BEN We both look good in gold.
ALISON Good choice.
ALISON I would yell at you about driving so slow, except the baby's here.
BEN No, these guys can honk all they want.
BEN I ain't going faster than twelve.
BEN It might take us around three hours to get home, though.
The car moves slowly down the highway with a line of cars waiting behind them.
