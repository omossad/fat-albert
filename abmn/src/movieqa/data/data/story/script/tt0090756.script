screenplay by
David Lynch
Blue skies.
PAN SLOWLY DOWN to clean white picket fence, with beautiful red roses in front of it.
Birds CHIRP in the distance.
A faint sprinkler SOUND is heard.
Very sweet MUSIC is playing.
A songbird SINGS in the tree.
A very clean uniformed, smiling POLICEMAN with arms outstretched allows clean happy SCHOOL CHILDREN to cross the street safely.
A bright red gorgeous fire engine is moving very slowly down the street.
We MOVE IN to see the happy face of a FIREMAN.
Yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze.
The same white picket fence with roses in front of it.
PANNING SLOWLY now away from the roses down to the rich green lawn and over to the sprinkler which goes around and around shooting water droplets sparkling in the light.
This is slightly SLOW MOTION and DREAMY.
CLOSER ON WATER DROPLETS.
The water droplets are somewhat abstracted as they dance in the light.
PAN DOWN now to the green grass, traveling along the grass.
The MUSIC becomes fainter as we MOVE SUDDENLY under the grass, now as if in a dark forest.
The grass is like great timbers.
It is GETTING DARKER and ominous SOUNDS come up as we discover black insects crawling and scratching in the darkness.
MR.
BEAUMONT is watering flowers and grass with the hose.
He is dressed in khaki trousers, canvas shoes, old white shirt, straw hat and dark glasses.
CLOSE - MR. BEAUMONT watches his watering, then looks up.
The sky and the neighborhood are reflected in his dark glasses.
He moves his false teeth around a little in his mouth, jutting out his chin in the process.
He's thinking about who knows what.
He looks back down at his lawn.
The water hits the grass and mats it down.
WIDER - MR. BEAUMONT moves the hose over a bush and gets a kink in it.
Water stops coming out of the nozzle and there is a LOUD HISSING NOISE of water under pressure.
Loud HISSING NOISE.
Mr. Beaumont goes around the bush and is undoing the kink when he is suddenly hit with a tremendous seizure.
He's doubling over and falls to the ground.
He continues to grasp onto the hose.
Water shoots crazily onto the driveway and his car.
Mr. Beaumont seems to be in tremendous pain.
Mrs. Beaumont is curled up on the couch, smoking a cigarette and watching T.V.
It's a daytime soap.
Takes a big drag of her cigarette and luxuriously french inhales a huge quantity of blue smoke.
She's enjoying her show.
His teeth are crooked in his mouth now as he tries to scream.
No sound is coming out.
WATER SOUND is loud.
Water is still spraying out over the driveway and onto the car and into the yard beyond.
A small boy, GREGG, appears wearing only white underpants and a white t-shirt.
He holds a large red popsicle.
Gregg waddles around looking at the crazy water show.
He holds his hand out to get it wet in the spray.
This makes him screw up his face in a laugh.
He waddles over and looks at Mr. Beaumont on the ground.
Mr. Beaumont seems to be worse now, unconscious, but still gripping the hose tightly.
His clothes are sopping wet.
Screen window of Gregg's house.
Gregg's mother calls out but remains looking at a bowl she is holding in her hands.
Gregg.
Billy's waiting for his teddy.
She then turns to look out.
GREGG!
Billy's waiting for his teddy, honey.
IN THE DISTANCE, she sees Gregg's back, a bush, some legs with wet khaki trousers and water squirting up in the air.
TRAVELING along sidewalk, bushes, to lighted windows of an auditorium.
MUSIC is heard.
A dance is going on.
Sixties MUSIC plays, performed by a live band on stage.
College kids dance.
A COLLEGE BOY enters the auditorium, urgently looking for someone.
He quickly approaches a GIRL.
COLLEGE BOY Louise?
COLLEGE BOY Where's Jeffrey?
COLLEGE BOY His mother's on the phone - it's an emergency.
LOUISE He disappeared to the men's room a little while ago.
LOUISE I'm getting very tired of waiting - let's go find him.
We MOVE INTO the face of JEFFREY.
He is hiding behind a furnace.
He is fascinated by a sight beyond in the darkness of this basement room.
He sees a male student trying to rape his girlfriend.
She is crying and telling him to stop but the boy keeps forcing her down toward the ground.
forcing her clothes off her.
Jeffrey at this point hears his name being called.
Each time he hears his name the caller is closer.
The boy is now hurting the girl.
Before Jeffrey leaves the furnace room he yells out:
JEFFREY Hey, shit head.
JEFFREY Leave her alone.
JEFFREY Don't force girls!
The couple looks up but cannot see Jeffrey.
The boy is scared and releases the girl who promptly pulls farther away, crying.
Jeffrey leaves the furnace room.
Louise and the college student see him and move quickly toward him.
COLLEGE BOY Jeffrey, your mother's on the phone.
COLLEGE BOY It's an emergency.
LOUISE Thanks for keeping me waiting so long.
As Jeffrey moves quickly toward the telephone.
I'm sorry, Louise.
The phone dangles on its cord in the foreground as Jeffrey moves toward it in the background.
Louise slowly follows Jeffrey, but stays in back of him.
Jeffrey picks up the phone.
JEFFREY Hello.
JEFFREY Mom?
JEFFREY What's wrong with Dad?.
JEFFREY What's happening?.
JEFFREY Come home?
JEFFREY Sure I will.
Mrs. Beaumont sits talking on the phone in a dark quiet bedroom.
MRS. BEAUMONT I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY For good?.
JEFFREY I can't.
JEFFREY Mom.
JEFFREY Not right in the middle of the term.
BEAUMONT Jeffrey.
BEAUMONT honey.
BEAUMONT Your father's condition is serious.
BEAUMONT It's going to cost so much.
BEAUMONT We just won't have the money to keep you in school.
BEAUMONT I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do.
BEAUMONT it'll save you another trip back.
BEAUMONT You're going to have to work at the store.
Mom.
Louise looks at Jeffrey crying, then turns away.
Jeffrey hangs up the phone.
Mrs. Beaumont hangs up her phone.
just next to the phone traveling into a shadow is a winged termite.
Jeffrey is waiting in a girls dorm lobby for Louise.
Girls are milling around.
Louise gets off an elevator with some other girls.
She forces a smile at Jeffrey as she comes toward him.
JEFFREY Can't you come to the damn airport?
LOUISE Jeffrey.
LOUISE I can't.
LOUISE I really can't.
LOUISE I have to go to that class tonight.
LOUISE I can't get out of it.
LOUISE I really can't.
LOUISE I love you, Jeffrey.
LOUISE I'll miss you.
JEFFREY Alright.
JEFFREY I'll call you in a couple of days, you know.
JEFFREY I'll let you know how things are.
LOUISE Okay.
LOUISE I'll be here.
LOUISE You better git-going.
LOUISE I gotta go too sweetie.
LOUISE I hope your father's okay.
LOUISE I love you.
LOUISE I'm sorry, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY I love you too, Louise.
JEFFREY Damn it.
JEFFREY I'll see you.
They kiss.
Jeffrey comes walking out of the airport, where his Mother and AUNT BARBARA, who is a very absent-minded little woman with very thick glasses, are waiting for him.
They are parked illegally and another car is honking at them.
Their trunk is open in anticipation of Jeffrey's things.
They are waving and yelling at Jeffrey to get his attention.
He finally joins them and kisses his Mother, then his Aunt.
JEFFREY Hi Mom.
JEFFREY Hi Aunt Barbara.
They AD LIB hellos.
MRS. BEAUMONT Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
JEFFREY This is it.
Mrs. Beaumont looks at Jeffrey.
JEFFREY I sent a trunk home yesterday.
JEFFREY This is all I have.
AUNT BARBARA You look good, Jeffrey.
AUNT BARBARA Did you have a nice flight?
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY How's Dad?
MRS. BEAUMONT He's alright.
MRS. BEAUMONT We'll tell you on the way home.
They get in the car.
Aunt Barbara is driving.
She is not a good driver and makes Jeffrey nervous.
He watches her every move from the back seat.
They drive on surface streets.
Many gas stations, traffic lights, bars.
MRS. BEAUMONT He had a cerebral hemorrhage and they think there's some sort of clot, or tumor, or something in there.
MRS. BEAUMONT They're doing all sorts of tests.
MRS. BEAUMONT On the surface, he looks pretty good, but there are problems.
MRS. BEAUMONT They think he may have to stay in two weeks now, at least.
MRS. BEAUMONT You can go see him though tomorrow, Jeffrey.
AUNT BARBARA They tore down the A & P, Jeffrey.
AUNT BARBARA Did you see that?
JEFFREY Aunt Barbara that was 5 years ago.
The car pulls into the Beaumonts' driveway.
The neighborhood is quiet and dark.
Jeffrey, Aunt Barbara, and Mrs. Beaumont enter the living room.
Mrs.
Beaumont turns on a table lamp.
A cold circle of light hits the light blue rug.
AUNT BARBARA Home again, home again, jiggidy jog.
They look at Jeffrey.
He looks at them.
Jeffrey enters his small attic-type bedroom, turns on the overhead light, and sets his suitcase down.
He goes to his desk and leans across it to look outside.
The street is dark, except for a pool of light from a street light.
A breeze of cold powerful string MUSIC blows as we watch Jeffrey stare into space.
Mrs. Beaumont is calling upstairs to Jeffrey.
MRS. BEAUMONT Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
JEFFREY (V.O.) Be right down.
Mrs. Beaumont joins Aunt Barbara at the breakfast table in the kitchen.
AUNT BARBARA This is marvelous jam.
AUNT BARBARA Are you going this morning?
MRS. BEAUMONT I think Jeffrey would like to see his father alone.
Jeffrey comes down the stairs.
Everyone says their "good mornings," and Jeffrey sits down to breakfast.
JEFFREY What time are visiting hours?
MRS. BEAUMONT I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30.
MRS. BEAUMONT But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
JEFFREY Well.
JEFFREY Okay.
MRS. BEAUMONT Jeffrey, when you see your father.
JEFFREY Yeah?
MRS. BEAUMONT He doesn't know you're out of school.
MRS. BEAUMONT He thinks it's a vacation for you.
JEFFREY What?
MRS. BEAUMONT It would be too much for him.
MRS. BEAUMONT So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
JEFFREY Thanks a lot, Mom.
MRS. BEAUMONT .Jeffrey!.
MRS. BEAUMONT Nobody wanted you to leave
school and go to work in the store.
maybe going back to school will be an option one day.
I hope so.
AUNT BARBARA I think it's important not to get depressed.
AUNT BARBARA Depression is a terrible thing.
AUNT BARBARA They say it can bring on illness.
JEFFREY Aunt Barbara.
JEFFREY I'll try not to get depressed.
Jeffrey follows a nurse to a hospital room.
NURSE CINDY Please wait outside while Dr. Gynde prepares him to see you.
JEFFREY Prepares him?
She peers into the room.
Jeffrey does too.
All he can see are curtains surrounding a bed and stacks of medical machinery.
Doctor Gynde comes out from behind the curtains and walks to Jeffrey.
DR. GYNDE Hello Jeffrey.
JEFFREY Hello, Doctor Gynde.
JEFFREY How is he?
DR. GYNDE He's fighting hard.
DR. GYNDE Jeffrey.
DR. GYNDE it's very important that your father doesn't try to move.
DR. GYNDE he's been immobilized.
DR. GYNDE It would be very painful for him.
DR. GYNDE sit close.
DR. GYNDE you do the talking and moving.
DR. GYNDE He knows you're here.
DR. GYNDE He became very emotional.
DR. GYNDE I don't think he likes the idea of you seeing him like this.
Nurse Cindy goes to the bed.
She begins to pull the curtains back revealing Mr. Beaumont.
NURSE CINDY Mr. Beaumont!
NURSE CINDY Your son is here to visit you.
Then we see Mr. Beaumont.
He has numerous tubes and needles going into different parts of him.
A stainless steel device holds his head perfectly still.
Nurse Cindy picks up a tray and leaves.
JEFFREY Hi Dad.
MR. BEAUMONT (speaking as plainly as possible,
but sounds like mumbling) Hey Jeff.
Jeffrey goes to him and puts out his hand to shake his father's hand but remembers his father cannot move.
Jeffrey pats him on the shoulder.
JEFFREY Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
MR. BEAUMONT uh uh.
JEFFREY Are you feeling okay?
MR. BEAUMONT uh uh.
Tears well up in Mr. Beaumont's eyes.
Before Jeffrey can stop him he reaches for Jeffrey's hand, then struggling against tremendous pain he manages to form words.
MR. BEAUMONT Good to see you, son.
JEFFREY It's good to see you, Dad.
Jeffrey squeezes his father's hand.
Jeffrey is walking down a dirt road on his way home.
He kicks up little clouds of dust as he walks.
He has some time to think about things.
He sees a green bottle in the distance.
He gathers up a few more rocks and pitches them one by one at the bottle.
He misses.
He looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some tall grass and weeds, he sees something strange.
He looks closer.
It is a HUMAN EAR, covered with crawling ants.
Jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around.
All he sees are houses - some laundry drying - a very peaceful scene.
No one seems to be around - No one seems to be watching him.
He looks again at the ear.
We are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it.
There is dried blood on part of it.
Jeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig, he pushes the ear onto it.
Again, he stands up and looks around.
IN THE DISTANCE, a MAN goes into the back door of a house.
Nothing more.
Jeffery hurries off, carrying the bag with the ear in it.
Jeffrey goes up the front steps...
...
and to the Reception Desk.
A POLICE OFFICER is standing behind the counter.
JEFFREY Hello.
JEFFREY could you tell me if Detective Williams is still working here?
POLICE OFFICER He's up in Room 221.
POLICE OFFICER Right up the stairs.
Jeffrey enters Room 221 and sees the desk marked, "DETECTIVE J.D.
WILLIAMS," however, the desk is empty.
TWO MEN are talking at the end of the room; one of them comes toward Jeffrey.
JEFFREY Are you Detective Williams?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yes.
JEFFREY My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you.
JEFFREY I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Sure I do.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I understand he's in the hospital.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS How is he?
JEFFREY He's alright, I guess.
JEFFREY I hope.
JEFFREY They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school.
JEFFREY I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood.
JEFFREY there behind Vista, I found an ear.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS You did?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS A human ear?
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY I've got it here in this bag.
JEFFREY I thought I should bring it to you.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yep, that's right.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Let's take a look at it.
Jeffrey opens the bag and lets Detective Williams look inside.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS That sure looks like a human ear, doesn't it?.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Let's run it down to the Coroner's Office and see what they make of it.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Then, I want you to show me exactly where you found it.
Jeffrey, Detective Williams, and an OLD CORONER'S OFFICER are looking at the ear, which is sitting in a medical dish on a table.
CORONER'S OFFICER The tests will take awhile.
CORONER'S OFFICER Meanwhile, we'll check the morgue records.
CORONER'S OFFICER I don't recall anything coming in minus an ear.
The Coroner's Officer turns to Jeffrey.
CORONER'S OFFICER Now if you'd found a jaw or let's say, a heart, or even an arm, we would assume that there was a corpse, however, a finger or an ear.
CORONER'S OFFICER the person may very well be alive somewhere.
JEFFREY What can you tell about the person from the ear?
CORONER'S OFFICER Well.
CORONER'S OFFICER when the tests are done, quite a lot .
CORONER'S OFFICER Sex, blood type, whether or not the ear came off a dead person.
CORONER'S OFFICER Right now, I know what you know.
CORONER'S OFFICER It's a real human ear.
CORONER'S OFFICER The human was, or is, Caucasian.
CORONER'S OFFICER also.
CORONER'S OFFICER It looks like the ear was cut off with scissors.
Jeffrey is out with Detective Williams and a CREW OF OFFICERS who have roped off the area and are doing a grid search.
A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is also there taking flash pictures all around the field, especially where Jeffrey has told them he found the ear.
Detective Williams takes Jeffrey aside.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Got it?
JEFFREY Got it.
JEFFREY Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Come on.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I'll drive you home.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS It's on my way.
Mrs. Beaumont and Aunt Barbara are doing the dishes.
The news is on a small portable television.
There is a broadcast on the mounting crime wave.
A series of murders are being discussed and a police drawing mug shot is shown on the screen of the suspect who is at large.
Jeffrey is sitting at his desk daydreaming.
He suddenly picks up the phone, hesitates, then dials.
JEFFREY Hello?.
JEFFREY LOUISE WERTHAM please.
JEFFREY Louise?
JEFFREY is she there?.
JEFFREY Louise?
JEFFREY Yeah!
JEFFREY How are you?
JEFFREY He's okay.
JEFFREY in the hospital for tests.
JEFFREY I miss you so much.
JEFFREY What have you been up to?.
JEFFREY Louise, I don't know.
JEFFREY I've got to see how my father is .
JEFFREY It costs a fortune in that hospital.
JEFFREY When did he ask you to that?.
JEFFREY Look.
JEFFREY I can't stop you.
JEFFREY Go ahead.
JEFFREY Just go ahead .
JEFFREY I may never be back, go.
JEFFREY ahead.
JEFFREY Look Louise, stop trying to explain everything.
JEFFREY Just do it.
JEFFREY let's talk again in a couple of days or somethin', okay?.
JEFFREY Yeah, I still love you.
JEFFREY Goodbye Louise.
JEFFREY Goodbye.
Jeffrey sits alone in his room, thinking things over.
VERY SLOWLY, we MOVE very close to the ear, gliding slowly around the crevices approaching the dark hole.
A huge, low rushing of air SOUND,
Low light.
Jeffrey enters the room.
Aunt Barbara and Mrs. Beaumont are watching television.
Aunt Barbara is knitting.
JEFFREY I'm going out for awhile.
MRS. BEAUMONT Do you want the car?
JEFFREY No, I'm just gonna walk around.
MRS. BEAUMONT Alright.
AUNT BARBARA Jeffrey.
AUNT BARBARA you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood.
JEFFREY Don't worry.
Aunt Barbara and Mrs. Beaumont continue watching the television.
On T.V. we see a man's shoes.
He is sneaking slowly up some stairs.
Jeffrey walks along the dark streets.
The same sombre MUSIC plays low and slow.
Some of the houses have a few lights on, some are dark.
Some windows have a slow uneven blue flashing light, indicating the television is on inside.
Jeffrey continues walking through the night.
In the trees, the shadows continuously re-arrange themselves in mysterious, sometimes frightening patterns.
Jeffrey finally comes to the house he's been looking for.
He goes up the front walk.
Now, at the last minute, he feels a little foolish and has second thoughts about knocking on the door.
He looks in a window.
Inside, he sees a nicely-lit living room.
He goes ahead and knocks.
A very pleasant-looking middle class WOMAN answers the door.
JEFFREY Hello.
JEFFREY uh.
JEFFREY my name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
JEFFREY Is Detective Williams in?
MRS. WILLIAMS Oh, yes, Jeffrey.
MRS. WILLIAMS Come in.
MRS. WILLIAMS He'll be back
any minute now.
You're welcome to wait.
Is it urgent?
JEFFREY I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all.
JEFFREY Maybe I better go.
MRS. WILLIAMS Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
JEFFREY Alright.
She leads him back to the kitchen where she has him sit at the kitchen table.
She pours him a cup of coffee.
MRS. WILLIAMS I was sorry to hear about your father.
MRS. WILLIAMS I know your mother from church.
MRS. WILLIAMS It's such a shame.
JEFFREY Yeah, I know.
MRS. WILLIAMS Would you like a piece of cake?
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY No thank you.
MRS. WILLIAMS It's a real good chocolate cake.
MRS. WILLIAMS Duncan Hines' devil's food.
MRS. WILLIAMS real good.
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY okay.
Out in the living room, SANDY WILLIAMS and her BOYFRIEND, MIKE SHAW, come up from the basement.
They are both carrying books.
Sandy is a very good looking, high school senior and Mike is a big, handsome football player type.
WILLIAMS Sandy?.
Sandy and Mike come into the kitchen.
Jeffrey has a big piece of chocolate cake in his mouth.
MRS. WILLIAMS Jeffery, this is my daughter, Sandy, and.
MRS. WILLIAMS her boyfriend, Mike.
They all say "Hi" to one another.
SANDY Mike's gotta go.
SANDY Nice to meet you.
MIKE Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY It was nice meeting you too.
They leave and go out the front door.
MRS. WILLIAMS He comes over to study.
JEFFREY Yeah.
The front door opens.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (V.O.) Pam?
MRS. WILLIAMS In the kitchen, John!
Detective Williams comes into the kitchen surprised to see Jeffrey.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Oh.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Hello, Jeffrey.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS what's up?
He kisses his wife.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Come into the study a minute.
JEFFREY Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
MRS. WILLIAMS Certainly.
Jeffrey follows Detective Williams into his study.
Detective Williams' study is filled with filing cabinets.
The desk has two phones and is covered with papers and folders and a picture of Mrs.
Williams and Sandy.
The police radio is asking for Detective Williams as they enter.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Shut the door.
Detective Williams speaks through the radio while Jeffrey shuts the door.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Detective Williams here.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS yeah.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS yeah, copy.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Very interesting.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I know you must be curious to know more.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS But.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS One day.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Right now, though.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I can't.
JEFFREY I understand.
JEFFREY I'm just real curious like you said.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I was the same way when I was you age.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I guess that's what got me into this business.
JEFFREY It must be great.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS And it's horrible too.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I'm sorry Jeffrey.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS That's the way it has to be.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Anyway.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I'm sure you do understand.
Jeffrey studies Detective Williams' face as they walk back to the living room.
JEFFREY Mrs. Williams?
JEFFREY Thanks for the cake.
MRS. WILLIAMS Oh, you're welcome.
MRS. WILLIAMS Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS We will.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Good night.
Jeffrey leaves and they shut the door behind him.
As Jeffrey leaves the light of the front yard and enters onto the dark sidewalk, he hears Sandy call out behind him.
SANDY Are you the one that found the ear.
Jeffrey stops and turns around.
Sandy comes up to him.
JEFFREY Yeah, how did you know?
SANDY I just know, that's all.
SANDY I remember you from Central.
They slowly walk down the street together.
JEFFREY Oh yeah?
SANDY You were pretty popular.
SANDY Didn't you run for some office?
JEFFREY Yeah I did.
JEFFREY treasurer.
JEFFREY Shouldn't you be studying or something.
SANDY Am I bothering you?
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY You're not bothering me.
JEFFREY You a senior?
SANDY Yes.
JEFFREY How is Central these days?
SANDY Terrible.
SANDY boring.
JEFFREY What else is new?.
JEFFREY right?
SANDY Yeah.
SANDY What are you doing now?
JEFFREY I'm home from school.
JEFFREY My father's in the hospital.
SANDY That's too bad.
JEFFREY What do you know about the ear?.
JEFFREY anything?
SANDY Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
JEFFREY Come on.
JEFFREY you brought it up.
JEFFREY Do you know anything?
SANDY I don't really know much but bits and pieces .
SANDY I hear things.
SANDY My room is right above my father's office.
SANDY The ear.
SANDY there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person.
SANDY That's direct from the Coroner's Office.
SANDY The person is unknown.
SANDY There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear.
SANDY I heard some of the same names.
JEFFREY Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
SANDY There were at least three, maybe four.
SANDY But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear.
SANDY There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned.
SANDY and a musician.
SANDY and some others.
JEFFREY Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
SANDY No.
SANDY this has been going on for some time .
SANDY several months.
SANDY About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river.
SANDY They were from people who were reported missing.
SANDY They never found one complete body.
SANDY only parts.
JEFFREY The ear is from a missing person maybe?
SANDY Maybe so.
JEFFREY It's a strange world isn't it?
JEFFREY Do you know what building the woman lives in?
SANDY Yeah.
SANDY It's close by.
SANDY that's what's creepy.
SANDY They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
JEFFREY I guess you have to get back home soon?
SANDY Not really, why?
SANDY You want to see the building?.
SANDY Come on, I'll show you.
Jeffrey and Sandy walk through the light of a street light.
The street sign "LINCOLN ST" can be read.
They walk into darkness and continue down to an apartment building on the right side of the street.
SANDY That's the building.
SANDY She lives on the Seventh Floor.
SANDY Don't stop to look long .
SANDY the police are watching.
JEFFREY Where are they?
SANDY I don't know.
SANDY you're not supposed to see them.
SANDY They're supposed to see you.
They begin walking slowly back to Sandy's house.
JEFFREY Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
SANDY I don't know.
SANDY like I said, she's not my father's case.
JEFFREY Oh yeah.
JEFFREY What about those other people?
JEFFREY Anything?
SANDY My father is watching the businessman.
SANDY The businessman had a partner who disappeared.
SANDY left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids.
SANDY They think he's been murdered.
JEFFREY You really do hear a lot, don't you?
SANDY Yeah, I guess so.
SANDY What are you going to do now that you're home?
JEFFREY I have to help out in my father's hardware store.
JEFFREY they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while.
JEFFREY which is nice.
SANDY Still, it must be kinda rough.
JEFFREY It's not bad.
JEFFREY but it's bad enough.
JEFFREY it's a lot worse for my father.
JEFFREY I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
Jeffrey and Sandy both laugh.
SANDY What happened to him?
JEFFREY I don't know.
JEFFREY he moved away.
Jeffrey and Sandy walking and talking, sometimes laughing in the distance, while the MUSIC theme, haunting yet warm, plays over.
They arrive back at Sandy's home.
CLOSER ON JEFFREY AND SANDY in front of Sandy's home.
SANDY I've gotta go in.
JEFFREY Thanks for the tour.
JEFFREY It was nice talking to you.
Sandy just looks at him shyly before she turns to go up the front walk.
JEFFREY I guess I'll see you sometime.
SANDY I guess so.
SANDY Like you said.
SANDY It's a strange world.
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY Good bye.
Jeffrey watches as Sandy goes inside her house.
He watches her house for a moment and sees her cross the living room.
He turns and walks away.
Again, the MYSTERIOUS CHORDS OF MUSIC swell up as Jeffrey walks through the night.
Jeffrey is poking around in the back room.
He picks up some bug spraying devices.
He yells out to an old black man who works in the store.
JEFFREY Hey, Ed, okay if I borrow these bug spraying rigs later on?
Ed peers into the back room.
Spots Jeffrey.
ED Listen Bud.
ED If you need to spray for bugs they're yours.
ED It causes me no pain.
JEFFREY Okidoke Ed.
JEFFREY Thanks.
Jeffrey puts the stuff in the trunk of the car.
There are several "Awake" magazines there too.
He gets in the front seat and drives off.
Jeffrey driving.
He looks at his watch.
It is 3:30.
Jeffrey is parked across the street from the school.
High school kids are pouring out the front door.
In a moment he sees Sandy come out with two or three other girls.
They walk down the sidewalk away from Jeffrey.
He starts the car and slowly follows them to the corner, where he pulls up alongside of them.
very close.
Sandy suddenly recognizes him.
JEFFREY You hungry or thirsty, or both?
SANDY I don't know.
JEFFREY I'd like to talk to you about something.
SANDY Just a minute.
SANDY pull over and wait a minute.
Sandy pulls her girlfriends away from Jeffrey's car and says something to them.
There is some whispering and giggling and then,
SANDY Please, don't say anything to Mike.
SANDY promise?
The girls promise.
Sandy goes around and gets in the car.
JEFFREY I don't want to cause any trouble.
SANDY I'm here, aren't I?
JEFFREY I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
SANDY Ooooo, you are smart.
SANDY Just don't get too smart.
Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in a booth.
Jeffrey's grilled cheese on white bread and a coke have just arrived along with Sandy's coke.
SANDY Alright, now tell me.
SANDY What is it?
JEFFREY There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience.
JEFFREY sometimes, in some cases.
JEFFREY it's necessary to take a risk.
JEFFREY I got to thinking.
JEFFREY I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment.
JEFFREY you know.
JEFFREY sneak in and hide and observe.
SANDY You said it was a strange world.
SANDY and you're the strangest part of it.
SANDY Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder.
SANDY This gives me the creeps.
JEFFREY Settle down.
JEFFREY I have a plan which I think will work.
JEFFREY There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help.
JEFFREY .Aren't you curious about my plan?
SANDY It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
JEFFREY Alright.
JEFFREY the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
SANDY Now, how are you going to do that?
JEFFREY Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig.
JEFFREY I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man.
JEFFREY I will spray her apartment.
JEFFREY After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
SANDY What will I say when she comes to the door?
JEFFREY You will be a Jehovah's Witness.
JEFFREY I have a few "Awake" magazines for you.
JEFFREY You don't have to keep her very long.
JEFFREY a few seconds is all I'll need.
JEFFREY Whatiya think?
SANDY I don't know.
SANDY it sounds like a good daydream, .
SANDY but actually doing it is too weird.
SANDY too dangerous.
JEFFREY Let's just try the first part.
JEFFREY If that goes well, we'll see about the rest.
JEFFREY No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
SANDY You've got a point there.
Jeffrey and Sandy are in the car.
Jeffrey is struggling to put on the old overalls.
JEFFREY Now.
JEFFREY we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes.
JEFFREY I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
SANDY Alright.
JEFFREY Let's go.
They get out of the car.
Sandy has the "Awake" magazines.
JEFFREY Okay, I'm going ahead.
JEFFREY Wait a minute, what's her name?
SANDY Oh bother.
SANDY Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.
SANDY Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
JEFFREY Thanks.
JEFFREY Dorothy Vallens.
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY good luck .
JEFFREY three minutes, no sooner.
SANDY Alright.
SANDY Good luck, yourself.
Jeffrey takes off in the direction of the apartment building.
Jeffrey walks up the front steps and goes in the double outer doors.
He looks up and down the mailboxes and finally finds "D.
Vallens, Apartment Number 710."
Jeffrey goes into the lobby.
Jeffrey climbs the stairs.
An OLD LADY is making her way down the stairs.
She sees Jeffrey and his rig.
OLD LADY Well, it's about time you came.
Jeffrey forces a smile at her and after she's gone.
JEFFREY That's a good sign.
He keeps climbing.
He arrives at the Seventh Floor.
and finds Number 710.
He knocks and waits.
He looks around.
the hallway is empty.
DOROTHY VALLENS opens the door.
She is a very beautiful woman in her late thirties.
She has a beautiful full figure, dark eyes, black thick wavy hair.
Full red lips.
Right now, however, she looks a bit tired and a bit frumpy in an old terrycloth robe.
DOROTHY Yes?
DOROTHY What is it?
JEFFREY Pest control.
JEFFREY gotta do your apartment.
DOROTHY Oh God, that stuff stinks.
JEFFREY Nope.
JEFFREY it's new stuff.
JEFFREY no smell.
DOROTHY Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey goes all around the baseboards, spraying.
All the while he's getting a good look around the apartment.
There is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape.
Jeffrey looks around to see what Dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying.
The apartment is smaller than he thought, so he sprays the kitchen very slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed.
Suddenly, there is knocking at the door.
DOROTHY What is this.
DOROTHY Grand Central Station?
She opens the door.
Jeffrey looks.
It's not Sandy.
A MAN, with a yellow sports coat, is standing there.
Jeffrey begins to sweat, because the MAN looked around Dorothy to see him.
Dorothy says something to the Man which Jeffrey cannot hear.
The next time Jeffrey looks up, the Man is gone.
The whole thing looks to be turning out badly when Jeffrey spots a key on the counter.
On a long shot, he steals it just as the front door shuts.
He wraps things up and gets out.
JEFFREY That oughta do it.
DOROTHY Yeah.
Jeffrey leaves.
Out on the stairs, he finds Sandy with her "Awake" magazines.
SANDY Are you alright?
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY let's get outta here.
JEFFREY What happened?
As they go downstairs,
SANDY I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me.
SANDY Was it alright?
JEFFREY Yes and no.
JEFFREY Did you recognize him?
SANDY No.
SANDY I only saw his back.
SANDY He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
JEFFREY I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me.
JEFFREY I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.
JEFFREY Pretty nifty, huh?
SANDY Yeah, if it opens the door.
JEFFREY Yeah.
They get to the door of the apartment building.
JEFFREY You go first.
They leave the building separately.
When Jeffrey gets to the car, Sandy isn't there.
He looks around.
He starts the car and drives off.
There, up ahead, he spots her.
He pulls over and she gets in.
SANDY So.
SANDY what's next?
JEFFREY Pretty clever.
JEFFREY Are you game for more?
SANDY I owe you.
SANDY since I goofed up this one.
JEFFREY You didn't goof it up, but.
JEFFREY you still owe me one.
JEFFREY I want to sneak in tonight.
JEFFREY It's Friday.
JEFFREY do you have a date tonight?
SANDY Yes.
SANDY I do.
JEFFREY Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl.
JEFFREY I guess you would have a date.
JEFFREY that does that.
Jeffrey is driving Sandy home.
SANDY You really want to do this, don't you?
JEFFREY I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
They pull up in front of Sandy's house.
SANDY I'll tell Mike I'm sick.
SANDY There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me.
SANDY Afterwards he can go out with the guys.
SANDY Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike.
SANDY What do want me to do?
JEFFREY First of all, we'll have a nice dinner.
JEFFREY Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
SANDY I already know.
SANDY The "Slow Club."
SANDY It's on Route 7.
JEFFREY Great.
JEFFREY I'll pick you up around eight o'clock.
JEFFREY Is that good?
SANDY Yeah, but don't pick me up.
SANDY my father may think it's strange.
SANDY I'll walk over to your house.
SANDY I'll be there at eight o'clock.
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY You better get out before someone sees us.
Sandy gets out of the car and without turning around walks into her house.
Jeffrey calls out after her.
JEFFREY See ya!
The television is on.
Some crime show is playing, but the SOUND is very low.
The FAMILY DOCTOR is over and is giving Mrs. Beaumont an injection of medicine.
Aunt Barbara is sitting nearby.
DR. GYNDE That will take care of you, Frances, for another week.
DR. GYNDE I don't want you to overdo things either.
DR. GYNDE Take it very easy.
AUNT BARBARA I'll see to it, Bill.
DR. GYNDE Good.
MRS. BEAUMONT I feel fine.
DR. GYNDE That's not the point.
DR. GYNDE You're under a great deal of stress.
DR. GYNDE don't overdo it.
DR. GYNDE don't be foolish.
Jeffrey enters the room - to say goodnight.
JEFFREY Doctor Gynde.
JEFFREY my whole family's sick.
JEFFREY What's going on?
AUNT BARBARA I'm not sick.
Jeffrey points to his head and makes a circular "crazy" gesture.
They all laugh, except Aunt Barbara.
AUNT BARBARA We'll see who stays in my will.
They laugh again.
JEFFREY Can I use the car tonight?
MRS. BEAUMONT Of course, Jeffrey.
They say their goodnights.
Jeffrey and Sandy are looking at each other.
Jeffrey turns back to driving.
Sandy watches Jeffrey drive then she turns and watches the stores and shops go by.
When she is turned away, Jeffrey turns and look at her.
Sandy is thinking.
SANDY What's the plan.
JEFFREY First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens.
JEFFREY We'll watch her for awhile.
JEFFREY I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
SANDY Brilliant.
JEFFREY Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
SANDY This is not my usual Friday night!
The SLOW CLUB is a sleazy night club on the outskirts of town.
It has a dirty trash-strewn parking lot in front of it, where Jeffrey and Sandy park.
They get out of the car and enter the club.
SLEAZY MAITRE D' Good evening.
SLEAZY MAITRE D' two?
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY Could we get a small table in the back?
SLEZY MAITRE D' Surely, come this way.
They follow him and are seated.
MAITRE D' May I get you something to drink?
JEFFREY I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
SANDY That sounds good.
JEFFREY Two.
MAITRE D' Two Heinekens, thank you.
The Maitre d' leaves.
On stage a FAT COMIC is telling jokes.
The jokes are tailored for this kind of working-class crowd.
The people are laughing.
The place is almost full.
Jeffrey and Sandy are taking it all in.
JEFFREY When does Dorothy Vallens come on?
WAITER I don't know.
WAITER pretty soon.
WAITER Who knows.
After the Waiter leaves,
SANDY That guy was filled with information.
They pour their beers.
JEFFREY Here's to.
JEFFREY an interesting experience.
SANDY I'll drink to that.
They drink.
Later.
Jeffrey and Sandy have just finished dinner.
The M.C. is arranging a floral art deco microphone and a SAXOPHONE PLAYER, a BASS PLAYER, and a DRUMMER are on stage.
M.C. Ladies and gentlemen.
M.C. The Blue Lady.
M.C. Miss Dorothy Vallens.
There is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue laughing, talking, and drinking.
Dorothy Vallens comes out on stage.
She smiles.
The house lights are still up.
As she sings the first lines of "BLUE MOON" the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on her as she sings the word, "Blue."
This is a very sexy and slow version of the song.
During the song, Jeffrey and Sandy look at one another with the thought that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into.
Jeffrey and Sandy leave as Dorothy starts her next song, "BLUE VELVET."
They hear the first few lines before they get out the door.
They hurry to the car, get in, and drive off.
Jeffrey and Sandy drive through dark areas of the city.
They don't talk as they drive, but again they sneak glances at one another.
They turn in to the street where Dorothy Vallens lives and glide to a stop close to the building.
Jeffery cuts the engine.
It is very quiet.
Both are looking around to see if anyone is out or watching.
Jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the Seventh Floor.
It is dark.
Sandy moves.
Every tiny sound is heard.
Sandy looks at Jeffrey for some time, then back at the building.
SANDY Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
JEFFREY Why not?
SANDY It's crazy and dangerous.
SANDY My God.
SANDY I shouldn't have told you.
JEFFREY It'll be okay.
JEFFREY I don't think you should wait out here though.
JEFFREY I think you should go home.
JEFFREY Can you drive this car?
SANDY Yeah.
SANDY but.
JEFFREY Leave it in the front of your house for me.
JEFFREY okay?
JEFFREY Could you wait a little while.
JEFFREY this key may not fit.
SANDY I wish you wouldn't do this.
SANDY It doesn't make any sense.
SANDY Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
JEFFREY I'm going in, Sandy.
JEFFREY I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
SANDY I.
SANDY I don't want to see you tomorrow.
SANDY Mike's coming over.
JEFFREY Oh, okay.
JEFFREY can I call?
SANDY Okay.
SANDY yeah, call.
JEFFREY Look.
JEFFREY it can wait till Sunday.
SANDY Call tomorrow.
SANDY It's okay.
SANDY Good luck.
SANDY I hope you can sneak out okay.
SANDY You're going to wait until she's asleep?
JEFFREY Yeah.
SANDY I'm going to wait here until she comes.
JEFFREY Are you sure?
SANDY I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up.
SANDY Okay?
Jeffrey nods.
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY thanks.
SANDY I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
JEFFREY That's for me to know and for you to find out.
JEFFREY I'll see you.
JEFFREY I mean call you.
JEFFREY okay?
SANDY Okay, okay.
SANDY Bye.
Jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door.
He looks in one more time at Sandy.
They stare at each other silently.
Jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car.
Sandy watches him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building.
She slides over and sits in the driver's seat.
Jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor.
SOMEONE comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor.
He goes up another flight of stairs to the Eighth Floor and waits until the man goes downstairs.
Jeffrey then goes back to the Seventh Floor and goes to Door 710.
He takes out the key and looks around.
No one.
He inserts the key.
It fits.
He turns it.
The door opens.
He quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door.
It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.
Soon he finds his way around.
He decides on the closet to hide in.
However before he goes in to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the darkness.
He goes down the hallway to the back bedroom.
Across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty child's room.
In the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a propeller on top.
The kind that plays music when the propeller turns.
The hat is sitting silently on the bed post.
He quietly closes the door.
He returns to the closet.
Once inside, he checks out how much he can see.
Through the slats he has a view of half the apartment.
This is where he will stay.
He moves around some to relax.
He takes several deep breaths.
He looks at his watch.
It says "10:17."
Sandy sits in the car, carefully watching the apartment building and street.
In the closet, Jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to stretch his muscles which are getting tired.
Again, he takes several deep breaths.
He looks at his watch - it says 12:45.
JEFFREY Oh no, hurry up Dorothy.
JEFFREY Come on!.
JEFFREY and I gotta pee.
JEFFREY Great.
JEFFREY it's now or never.
Jeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to the door of the bathroom.
His foot hits the door and it makes a loud noise.
He freezes.
He moves again into the bathroom.
He starts to pee.
JEFFREY Heineken.
Suddenly Sandy sits up alert.
A car drives up and a MAN helps Dorothy Vallens get out.
They walk into the building.
Jeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else is so quiet the water SOUNDS seem very loud.
Sandy begins to honk the horn.
Unable to hear the warning horn, Jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom as the tank is still filling.
SUDDENLY, he hears something.
a key going in the door.
He bolts toward the closet.
He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front door opens.
Just as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off - SILENCE, except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door.
DOROTHY (V.O.) Thanks Jimmy, see you tomorrow.
DOROTHY (V.O.) You want a drink, or something?
JIMMY (V.O.) I better get back.
JIMMY (V.O.) thanks anyway.
DOROTHY Goodnight.
JIMMY Goodnight now.
The front door shuts and the living room lights go on.
Jeffrey can see Dorothy come toward him.
She walks RIGHT UP, almost to his face, when the phone RINGS.
She turns immediately and goes to answer it.
Jeffrey almost passes out.
He thought he'd had it.
He overhears.
DOROTHY Hello.
DOROTHY yes.
DOROTHY yes sir, Frank.
DOROTHY Let me talk to him.
DOROTHY Please Frank, sir.
DOROTHY I like to sing Blue Velvet.
DOROTHY Don?
DOROTHY It's okay.
DOROTHY Don't worry.
DOROTHY Don??.
DOROTHY can you hear me?
DOROTHY Is little Donny OK?
DOROTHY Is he there?
DOROTHY Don?
DOROTHY You mean Meadow Lane?
DOROTHY Frank?!
DOROTHY What's the matter with him?
DOROTHY I know.
DOROTHY When?
DOROTHY Okay.
DOROTHY In an hour.
DOROTHY I'll be sweet.
DOROTHY Momma loves you.
DOROTHY Okay Frank, sir.
She hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands.
DOROTHY Frank, you son of a bitch!
She goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail.
She nervously gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides the photograph under a pillow on the couch.
She puts on a record, "FOR YOUR PRECIOUS LOVE."
She sits back down and chews her nail again, listening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry.
She stops herself and takes the record off.
She starts taking off her stocking.
She then takes off her dress.
Underneath, she has on a bra and panties.
She crosses the living room, goes down the hallway into the bathroom.
Jeffrey can't see her too well now.
She takes off her panties in the bathroom.
She is now naked.
She looks at herself in the mirror.
We see Jeffrey's face as he watches her.
She disappears from view completely and we HEAR her start a SHOWER.
Jeffrey's face.
He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again.
He quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can.
She opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe.
She doesn't see Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden.
She closes the door.
It CLICKS shut.
Jeffrey is in almost total darkness.
He listens.
He can HEAR WALKING around, then silence.
He hears the kitchen sink WATER RUNNING.
He HEARS her WALKING AGAIN.
Now he can see her.
She sits down on her bed.
She looks up.
Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight.
She looks at the closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it.
She slowly gets up.
Jeffrey doesn't know what is up.
He looks but she walks out of view.
SUDDENLY, he hears a DRAWER OPEN, and just as suddenly, the CLOSET DOOR FLIES OPEN, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him.
When she realizes that SOMEONE IS REALLY THERE, she SCREAMS ONCE, very loud.
DOROTHY GET OUT OF THERE!!
DOROTHY GET OUT!!
DOROTHY Put your hands up, on your head.
DOROTHY GO ON!!
DOROTHY Get down on your knees - DO IT!!
DOROTHY What are you doing?
DOROTHY Who are you?
DOROTHY What's your name?.
JEFFREY Jeffrey.
DOROTHY Jeffrey.
DOROTHY Jeffrey what?
JEFFREY Jeffrey nothing.
DOROTHY You tell me!!
DOROTHY Let me see that wallet.
DOROTHY Jeffrey Beaumont.
DOROTHY What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
JEFFREY I wanted to see you.
DOROTHY What?
DOROTHY Are you kidding me?
DOROTHY Who sent you here?
JEFFREY Nobody.
DOROTHY Shit.
DOROTHY You better tell me something.
JEFFREY I was.
JEFFREY an experiment.
JEFFREY Just to see if I could do it.
DOROTHY An experiment?
DOROTHY Hey, I've seen you before.
JEFFREY I sprayed your apartment.
JEFFREY I took your key.
JEFFREY I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
DOROTHY Tell me what you saw tonight.
DOROTHY TELL ME.
JEFFREY I saw you come in, talk on the phone.
JEFFREY get undressed.
DOROTHY The phone.
DOROTHY What did you hear on the phone .
DOROTHY Tell me.
DOROTHY Word for word.
JEFFREY You said hello.
JEFFREY to Frank.
JEFFREY You wanted to talk to someone?.
JEFFREY Don?.
JEFFREY and little Donny.
JEFFREY You said something about Momma loves you.
JEFFREY and something about a Meadow Lane.
JEFFREY something in an hour.
JEFFREY I don't remember any more.
Dorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking.
DOROTHY That's right.
DOROTHY That's what I said.
DOROTHY You have a good memory.
DOROTHY Then what?
JEFFREY Well.
JEFFREY Then you got undressed.
DOROTHY How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
JEFFREY Never before this.
DOROTHY How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.
DOROTHY Get undressed.
DOROTHY I want to see you.
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY Come on.
DOROTHY NO, you come on.
DOROTHY Take off your pants.
DOROTHY I want to see you.
JEFFREY Look.
JEFFREY I'm sorry.
JEFFREY Just let me leave.
DOROTHY No way.
Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife.
She goes to Jeffrey.
Now she has a knife and a gun.
He's scared.
DOROTHY Get undressed.
DOROTHY I want to see you.
Jeffrey begins to undress.
First he takes off his shoes and socks, Then his shirt.
He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them off.
Now he is only in his underwear.
He does.
DOROTHY Come closer.
Dorothy has a strange look on her face.
She reaches out and pulls Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees.
She looks at him.
DOROTHY What do you want from me?
JEFFREY I .
JEFFREY I don't know.
DOROTHY What do you want?
Dorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice.
She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts.
DOROTHY Don't move.
DOROTHY don't look at me.
Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him.
DOROTHY Do you like that?
JEFFREY Yes.
He tries to touch her.
DOROTHY Don't move or I'll kill you.
She looks at him.
DOROTHY Do you like talk like that?
JEFFREY No.
DOROTHY Lie down on the bed.
He lies down.
He looks frightened.
There's a KNOCK, KNOCK on the door.
Dorothy looks VERY frightened.
She quickly moves a finger to her lips in a "quiet" sign and whispers to Jeffrey.
DOROTHY Shut up.
DOROTHY Hurry!
DOROTHY Go in the closet.
DOROTHY Don't say anything or you'll get killed.
DOROTHY I mean it.
KNOCKING is heard louder at the door.
Jeffrey picks up all his clothes and gets in the closet.
He's naked and hiding in the closet.
Dorothy closes her robe and glides to the front door.
Jeffrey sees FRANK come in.
Frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut.
He is wearing a tight blue t-shirt and an old black sports jacket.
He's got on a pair of blue jeans and boots.
He has a raw, mean sexuality - a "bomb about to go off" - presence.
He comes into the room slowly, always looking at Dorothy.
He sits on the couch.
DOROTHY Hello, baby.
Shut up.
It's daddy.
shithead.
DOROTHY Hello, daddy.
FRANK my bourbon.
Dorothy goes into the kitchen to get Frank his drink.
As she passes the closet, Jeffrey can see the fear in her face.
She returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to Frank.
Frank sips on it.
FRANK sit down.
FRANK get your chair.
Dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down.
She adjusts her robe.
FRANK spread your legs.
Dorothy slowly spreads her legs.
She can see Jeffrey staring out of the darkness of the closet at her.
FRANK wider.
She opens her legs wider.
Frank looks at her crotch and drinks his bourbon.
He stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at Dorothy, her body - her crotch.
Dorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting.
Frank suddenly reaches to his belt, where he has a small canister and a mask.
He opens a valve on the canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth.
The canister is filled with helium, which makes Frank's voice very high and strange sounding.
The result is frightening.
FRANK mommy.
Dorothy jumps.
She keeps looking at the ceiling.
DOROTHY mommy's here.
FRANK Baby wants to fuck.
Then, Frank's voice goes to normal.
Frank goes to Dorothy and kneels down in front of her.
He takes one more gasp of helium.
FRANK Baby wants blue velvet.
Dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to Frank.
DOROTHY Okay.
Frank slowly moves
Frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the texture of the velvet.
His hands rub the velvet and feel Dorothy's body underneath.
His hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the velvet robe.
Dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear.
Then Frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls Dorothy down to rug.
He warns her.
FRANK Don't look at me!
He begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth.
Then, he pushes her arms back and she keeps them back, letting Frank have his way.
Frank sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and feels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way.
Dorothy is moaning.
Frank is breathing very heavily.
He feels her crotch.
FRANK Don't look at me!!!
FRANK Daddy's home.
He starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of Dorothy.
He starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him.
Faster and faster, then he has a climax in his pants.
Dorothy's head is falling back.
She can see Jeffrey blurred in the distance - in the closet.
Cautiously, she looks sideways at Frank.
FRANK Don't look at me!!!
He slugs her in the face.
His nose is running and he's stifling sobs from deep within him.
On his hands and knees, he moves away.
The robe pulls out of his mouth.
His breathing is even heavier now.
He stands and begins to move around the apartment.
He goes to a wall, turns off the lights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing big, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying.
Dorothy moans softly.
It gets very quiet and still for a moment.
Then, Jeffrey hears Frank with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom.
The high, strange sound reverberates in the distance.
Jeffrey can't make it out - soon, he hears Frank's high laughing.
Frank comes back into the living room.
The mask is around his face.
All his breathing - every sound is high .
He laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door.
FRANK Stay alive baby.
FRANK See you next Christmas!
Frank leaves and shuts the door.
The apartment is silent except for Dorothy's moans.
Jeffrey is stunned.
He doesn't move.
He watches Dorothy in the half-light.
She rolls over and starts crying.
The crying is deep and genuine.
Slowly, Jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her.
He bends down and touches her.
She flinches and turns to see him.
She turns back sobbing.
He tries to get her up.
JEFFREY Why don't you come lie down.
JEFFREY Come on, I'll help you.
She struggles up with Jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed.
She falls down on her side, turned toward the wall.
He covers her with the sheet.
DOROTHY Don't.
DOROTHY I don't like that.
DOROTHY What do you want?
JEFFREY Nothing.
JEFFREY Are you alright?
DOROTHY Sure I'm alright.
JEFFREY I'll go then.
He starts to put on his underwear.
They're inside out.
He tries to turn them around.
DOROTHY Don?
JEFFREY No.
DOROTHY Don.
DOROTHY Hold me.
DOROTHY I'm scared.
DOROTHY Hold me.
DOROTHY Please.
Jeffrey turns to her.
He studies her.
He reaches out and takes her shoulders.
He moves down and holds her.
DOROTHY Thank you.
DOROTHY honey.
JEFFREY It's okay.
JEFFREY It's okay.
They lie together for a long silent moment.
DOROTHY Do you like the way I feel?
JEFFREY Yes.
DOROTHY See my breasts?
DOROTHY See?
Jeffrey looks.
JEFFREY Yes.
DOROTHY See my nipples?
JEFFREY Yes.
DOROTHY You can kiss them if you want.
DOROTHY Fell them .
DOROTHY They're getting hard.
Jeffrey starts to move closer.
Dorothy closes her eyes.
DOROTHY Go ahead.
DOROTHY I don't mind.
Jeffrey can't help himself.
He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her breasts.
They both are getting very hot.
DOROTHY Feel me.
Jeffrey is all over her now.
Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him.
DOROTHY You can hit me, if you want to.
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY please.
JEFFREY I won't.
Dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the wall.
JEFFREY Stop it!
She moves and won't let him feel her anymore.
She holds his hands away.
DOROTHY Do you like me?
JEFFREY Yes, I like you.
DOROTHY You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
They start making love.
Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying.
JEFFREY What's the matter?
Suddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face.
very hard.
DOROTHY Get off me.
Jeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face.
Dorothy goes into the bathroom crying all the way.
Jeffrey sits, confused.
Suddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy.
A true scream of horror.
He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong.
She is just flushing something down the toilet.
The water SOUND rushes.
He turns to her.
She is trembling and in a state of shock.
DOROTHY I made it go down the toilet.
JEFFREY What?
He looks in the swirling water.
It looks like an ear revolving around and around then whatever it is disappears.
DOROTHY I made it go down the toilet.
Jeffrey looks up.
he sees written with a bar of soap the words "look down" on the mirror.
He looks down into the sink.
At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood and a smear of fresher blood.
Jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating in the bathroom.
Frank in bathroom.
Frank at door saying "see you next Christmas."
JEFFREY Next Christmas.
JEFFREY Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy?
JEFFREY What was it?
JEFFREY An ear?
JEFFREY Another ear?!!
JEFFREY What was it?
DOROTHY Do you know?
JEFFREY No.
DOROTHY You don't?
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY What is happening?
DOROTHY Maybe you don't know.
DOROTHY I know you though.
DOROTHY You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
JEFFREY Please don't talk like that.
JEFFREY You're upset.
JEFFREY I'm not helping you.
JEFFREY I'm sorry for what I did.
JEFFREY I better go.
DOROTHY Go then.
DOROTHY I can't let you put it in me now but I want you.
DOROTHY I like you.
JEFFREY Then don't talk about killing.
DOROTHY Did I say that?.
DOROTHY I didn't mean it.
DOROTHY or did I?
DOROTHY Sometimes I think it would be fun.
DOROTHY Go ahead, you better leave now.
DOROTHY I can't open myself to you now.
DOROTHY I'll tell you a little secret.
DOROTHY I want to die.
JEFFREY Don't say that.
DOROTHY It's a secret so don't tell anyone.
DOROTHY Some day I'll show you where.
DOROTHY I've gotta go to sleep now.
He takes another look at the blood in the bottom of the sink.
He takes another look at the beautiful dark troubled eyes of Dorothy Vallens, and turns, goes through the hall to the living room.
He crosses slowly to the door, suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the bathroom.
He stops and looks at Dorothy who is turned away from him.
She stares into the sink.
Jeffrey notices that a square of fabric has been cut from the bottom of her blue velvet robe
JEFFREY I'm leaving now.
She is whispering something to herself.
DOROTHY Help me.
DOROTHY help me.
DOROTHY please help me.
Jeffrey doesn't know what he can do.
Jeffrey turns back, goes through the living room.
He looks around and sees the empty bourbon glass of Frank's.
Suddenly he remembers the photograph that Dorothy hid.
He picks up the pillow and sees a picture of a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed hat with a propeller.
He turns the photo over and finds an old marriage license.
It reads: Dorothy Vallens to Don.
JEFFREY (V.O.) Don.
JEFFREY (V.O.) Oh my God.
He hides the photo again.
He sees Dorothy's telephone.
He memorizes the number - moving his lips with each digit.
He goes to the front door and opens it quietly.
He looks out into the hall.
It's empty.
He quickly goes to the back stairway and down the stairs.
These steps are cement and his feet make echoing sounds which seem very loud.
He goes through a door marked "EXIT".
and comes out, crosses a lawn and goes out onto the sidewalk.
He walks along taking in deep cleansing breaths.
He looks at his watch.
2:30.
He feels so confused, exhilarated, so uneasy.
He secretly worries about what he's gotten into.
Jeffrey enters the house.
THE CAMERA RUSHES along the rug in the dark to a foot.
The lights come on.
PAN UP the leg to Mrs. Beaumont waiting in a chair, staring.
JEFFREY God.
JEFFREY you scared me.
MRS. BEAUMONT Is something wrong?
MRS. BEAUMONT What's happened to your face?
JEFFREY Nothing.
JEFFREY I'm fine.
MRS. BEAUMONT You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey.
MRS. BEAUMONT There's got to be some order, Jeffrey.
MRS. BEAUMONT I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Jeffrey gets out of bed and goes to the phone.
He dials a number.
JEFFREY Louise Wertham, please.
JEFFREY okay.
JEFFREY Louise?.
JEFFREY Jeffrey.
JEFFREY Hi.
JEFFREY What's up?
JEFFREY MARRIED?!
JEFFREY Good night!
JEFFREY Louise!
JEFFREY Are you kidding?
JEFFREY Well, Louise, I wish you a lot of luck and if things don't work out,
I think you should go into comedy.
Jeffrey hangs up the phone hard.
He shakes his head.
Jeffrey's drinking a cup of coffee behind the counter in the store.
He thinks.
He takes another drink of coffee and sets the cup down.
He clasps his hands behind his back and begins pacing up and down.
JEFFREY How can I help her?
JEFFREY I can't tell her to go to Detective Williams.
JEFFREY She'll think I'm a policeman.
JEFFREY She has my address.
JEFFREY She can go there.
JEFFREY if she has to.
JEFFREY I'll tell her.
JEFFREY and her.
JEFFREY and she thinks I'm Don.
JEFFREY her husband?
JEFFREY Where the hell is Don?
JEFFREY - maybe he died.
Jeffrey dials the phone.
JEFFREY Hello?.
JEFFREY Mrs. Williams?.
JEFFREY This is Jeffrey Beaumont.
JEFFREY Fine.
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY Is Sandy there?
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY Hi Sandy.
JEFFREY Can you talk?
JEFFREY He is?.
JEFFREY Well, I guess I'll talk to you later on.
JEFFREY It went okay.
JEFFREY I'll tell you about it.
JEFFREY Dinner?.
JEFFREY Tomorrow night?
JEFFREY Seven o'clock, yeah, sounds good.
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY he's still in the hospital.
JEFFREY Okay, yeah.
JEFFREY See you tomorrow.
JEFFREY thanks.
The searching, mysterious MUSIC plays over while,
A DOCTOR is looking at various blood samples under a powerful microscope.
Various sophisticated gadgets are seen in CLOSEUPS.
JEFFREY (V.O.) This is what my father's disease looks like?
DR. GYNDE Yes.
The BLOOD is seen in CLOSEUP.
Cells are moving.
The Doctor makes a change in magnification.
The cells are huge - then, even bigger.
They are so big we can hear them moving.
The parking lot is half-full.
A strong wind is blowing trash around.
Jeffrey parks his car.
and enters the club.
He speaks to the Maitre d'.
JEFFREY A table in back, please.
MAITRE D' Certainly
Dorothy is singing her opening song as the Maitre d' seats Jeffrey.
JEFFREY I'll have an ice-cold Heineken.
MAITRE D' One Heineken, certainly, sir.
Jeffrey surveys the place after the Maitre d' leaves.
It is very dark and smoky inside.
He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting with some other GUYS watching Dorothy sing.
They are sitting two tables away.
Frank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious- looking.
He looks right up to her eyes.
In his hand he works a small piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers.
Again her first number, "BLUE MOON," segues into "BLUE VELVET."
This song she sings mainly to Frank.
When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else applauds loudly.
Jeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside.
He looks around at all the cars but none stand out as Frank's.
He gets into his car and pulls out across the street, re-parks the car and waits.
Traffic roars past Jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the SLOW CLUB.
Among them are Frank and his friends.
They get into a black Ford Fairlane and drive out of the parking lot - down the highway.
Jeffrey starts his engine and moves out after them.
He has to gun the car up to sixty-five to catch up with them.
The mysterious MUSIC plays.
He follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right.
He waits at a light right behind them.
Inside they are lighting cigarettes.
The light turns green and Frank takes off.
Jeffrey follows them through a dark area down by the docks.
He follows them up a narrow street through dark factories.
Dark, low MUSIC now.
Up ahead, Frank parks his car.
Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his lights and engine.
He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment building next to a bookbinding factory.
They disappear within.
The electric lines above buzz loudly.
Jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street.
He reaches Frank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down.
He looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it down in his notebook.
He continues on to the apartment building.
Inside he looks at the names on the mailboxes.
He sees a name - Frank Booth.
The name gives him the chills.
The apartment number is 26.
In the distance, he hears footsteps.
He quickly leaves.
and crosses the street down to his car.
He gets in and waits.
Frank comes out of the building and crosses to his car.
JEFFREY I'll bet I know where you're going.
He follows Frank as he pulls out.
Jeffrey discreetly parks just after Frank kills the engine on his car.
He watches Frank leave the parking lot.
He follows Frank through the same vacant lot where he found the ear.
He seems to use the lot as a secret short cut to Dorothy's apartment.
Jeffrey goes back to his car to wait.
A storm is building.
There is a roar of thunder as Frank slams his car door as he gets in.
His mouth twists into a smile as he guns the engine and leaves.
Jeffrey waits till Frank is safely gone.
JEFFREY I shouldn't go in.
JEFFREY I shouldn't.
JEFFREY but I'm too curious.
JEFFREY and I have to try to help her.
He then gets out of his car as the wind is building.
and runs through the vacant lot.
to Dorothy's building.
He goes up to the seventh floor and knocks twice on 710.
A moment passes, then the door flies open.
Dorothy looks as if she was expecting Frank to be coming back.
Dorothy
JEFFREY Hi.
JEFFREY can I come in?
DOROTHY Yeah.
DOROTHY hurry up though.
They go inside.
JEFFREY Are you alright?
Dorothy breaks down crying.
DOROTHY No.
DOROTHY I'm not.
Jeffrey goes to her.
DOROTHY Why are you here.
DOROTHY whatiya want?
JEFFREY I.
JEFFREY uh.
DOROTHY I looked for you in my closet tonight.
DOROTHY It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but.
DOROTHY I like you.
JEFFREY That's not crazy.
JEFFREY I like you too.
Dorothy looks up.
They stare at each other for some time.
DOROTHY I liked being with you last night.
JEFFREY same here.
There is a loud knocking on the door.
DOROTHY Oh shit.
JEFFREY Frank?
JEFFREY .can you stand up?
DOROTHY I'm alright.
DOROTHY go hide.
DOROTHY This won't take long.
DOROTHY Be quiet.
Jeffrey gets in the closet and Dorothy closes the door.
She holds her head collecting her fragile self.
Dorothy goes to the door and opens it.
It's the Man with the Yellow Sports Coat - tonight he's wearing a purple sports coat and light blue double knit pants.
His eyes are glazed and his face is broken out in a sweat.
YELLOW MAN Frank gone?
DOROTHY Yeah.
DOROTHY but get outta here.
DOROTHY He's comin' back.
YELLOW MAN Bull.
DOROTHY Alright, suit yourself.
YELLOW MAN He's comin' back?.
YELLOW MAN What for?
DOROTHY 'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for.
DOROTHY Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
YELLOW MAN Yeah, maybe so.
YELLOW MAN Frank's got me.
YELLOW MAN and you.
YELLOW MAN and really it's all thanks to Don.
YELLOW MAN isn't it.
YELLOW MAN remember that.
YELLOW MAN Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
DOROTHY Oh he forced you, huh?
YELLOW MAN He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in.
YELLOW MAN he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good.
YELLOW MAN I just feel so horny.
YELLOW MAN I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you.
YELLOW MAN Listen.
YELLOW MAN I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing.
YELLOW MAN let me wet my whistle, baby.
DOROTHY No way.
DOROTHY get out.
DOROTHY I'm gonna tell Frank.
DOROTHY I'm gonna tell him what you said.
YELLOW MAN Okay, I'm goin'.
YELLOW MAN You'll see.
YELLOW MAN I'll get you.
Dorothy kicks the door after he closes it, then she chains it.
Jeffrey comes out of the closet.
JEFFREY Nice guy.
JEFFREY Who's he?
DOROTHY Who's it, you mean.
SUDDENLY, Dorothy starts to shake and cry.
Jeffrey grabs her and shakes her and holds her tight to him.
She starts sobbing again.
DOROTHY Oh God.
DOROTHY Don!!!
DOROTHY Why can't I just die.
JEFFREY There you go again.
JEFFREY stop saying that.
JEFFREY You can make it.
DOROTHY I can't.
DOROTHY I can't.
DOROTHY You think you know so much.
JEFFREY Take it easy.
JEFFREY What's goin' on anyway?.
JEFFREY Why are you in so much trouble?
Dorothy is sobbing and Jeffrey is holding her.
There is a long silence and she calms down.
DOROTHY I.
DOROTHY don't.
DOROTHY okay.
DOROTHY Just don't.
DOROTHY just be with me.
DOROTHY Oh God.
DOROTHY Come with me.
DOROTHY Who are you.
DOROTHY Come up here.
Dorothy takes Jeffrey through the kitchen and out the back.
to a back stairway leading to the roof.
The storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full moon.
The wind continues to moan.
They move to the roof top and Dorothy leads Jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building.
A very sad forlorn version of "Somewhere over the Rainbow" - creeps through the wind.
DOROTHY Look.
JEFFREY No.
Falling.
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY Please, Dorothy.
JEFFREY Why are you in so much trouble?
He moves closer to her.
JEFFREY Who is Don?
DOROTHY Don?.
DOROTHY Are you in with them?
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY But you're in very big trouble.
DOROTHY Why are you so interested?
DOROTHY Why do you keep asking me?
JEFFREY I came back to help you.
JEFFREY You said do I let girls sneak into my house.
JEFFREY You know where I live.
JEFFREY if you need to.
JEFFREY come to where I live.
JEFFREY O.K.?
DOROTHY Who are you?
DOROTHY Maybe I'll need to.
DOROTHY you like me, huh?
JEFFREY Yes.
DOROTHY or do you just want me?
DOROTHY I'm going to let you enter me now.
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY I should go.
DOROTHY Please.
DOROTHY please stay.
She makes him kiss her.
he really likes it.
Once again, Jeffrey and Dorothy get VERY HOT.
Dorothy and Jeffrey lie down on the roof.
Dorothy cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the roof.
JEFFREY Why Dorothy?
We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper into it.
DOROTHY Don?
DOROTHY I have to make it hurt.
DOROTHY I want there to be nothing again.
DOROTHY Don!!!
She reaches up and clutches Jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish kiss.
Lightening cracks above them and the wind howls.
Jeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into darkness.
He continues down the sidewalk.
He looks up at the starry sky.
The stars are so far away - the feeling is cold and lonely.
Darkness: There are bell tones sounding, and as each one sounds pin points of light appear on Mr. Beaumonts distorted dream face.
He is trying to speak.
He's trying to say "Jeffrey."
Another dark image appears.
A robin sits in a tree at night.
Very close.
There is a slow low reverberating chirping sound.
Now Dorothy's apartment building at night.
A very low angle looking up to the roof.
Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from the roof.
It flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is a red high-heeled shoe.
As it fills the screen it becomes red lips of Dorothy's which open into a scream.
Jeffrey wakes in his room - terrified.
Jeffrey is talking with Aunt Barbara in the semi-dark living room.
JEFFREY Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
AUNT BARBARA Okay honey.
AUNT BARBARA that sounds nice.
AUNT BARBARA Jeffrey.
AUNT BARBARA I think you've got termites in the house.
JEFFREY Oh yeah?.
JEFFREY Have you seen any?
AUNT BARBARA I've seen a few.
JEFFREY Well, I haven't seen any.
JEFFREY I wouldn't worry about it.
JEFFREY Look.
JEFFREY I better go.
AUNT BARBARA Okay honey.
Jeffrey leaves and Aunt Barbara moves about tapping on the walls.
She moves into a dark area and taps.
Something falls.
She reaches down.
In EXTREME CLOSEUP we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick carpet.
Then in EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look.
She looks at the termite, then looks back at the walls.
We GLIDE ALONG the dark walls of the house.
They all sit around the dining room table.
They have their heads bowed in a prayer before dinner.
SANDY We thank you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
SANDY Amen.
They start passing food around.
MIKE Like I was saying.
MIKE if you toss the ball like this, with your fingers just down here, that thing'll spin like a beauty.
MIKE real straight.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yeah?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Then how come nobody caught anything last week?.
MIKE 'Cause we had a bad day.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS You play any sports, Jeffrey?
JEFFREY No.
MIKE Looks like you'd make a good runner.
JEFFREY Well.
MIKE I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football.
MIKE I mean.
MIKE no offense.
Jeffrey looks around and sees Sandy looking at him.
She then gives a stern look to Mike.
Then Mike and Sandy both look at Jeffrey.
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY you're right.
MIKE I mean.
MIKE some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
JEFFREY Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
MIKE Well, most guys don't.
MIKE I mean that's the point.
MIKE You all mind if I take my vitamins?
MRS. WILLIAMS No, Mike.
MRS. WILLIAMS but there are vitamins in the food, you know.
Everyone laughs.
MIKE Yeah, but I gotta supplement that.
MIKE I gotta take a bunch of zinc too.
MIKE The body is like a machine.
MIKE EVERYTHING has got to stay in perfect tune for perfect health.
MIKE That's what I'm interested in.
Sandy looks at Mike.
MIKE Oh yeah.
MIKE and a few other things.
Everyone laughs again.
SANDY We've got some Heinekens.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yeah.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I like Bud myself.
SANDY I'll get it.
SANDY Mike, whatiya want?
MIKE I guess another glass of water.
Sandy and Jeffrey share a look.
Mike and Sandy are sitting on a couch in the basement.
Jeffrey is sitting on a chair nearby.
The television set is on.
MRS. WILLIAMS Who wants dessert?
MRS. WILLIAMS It's blueberry pie.
MRS. WILLIAMS and ice cream.
Jeffrey and Sandy say "yes."
MIKE None for me, thanks.
Jeffrey looks over at Sandy.
Mike sees this.
There is more tension growing.
MIKE What are watchin' this junk for?
SANDY You can change it if you want to.
MIKE I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
SANDY Mike.
SANDY We don't have to watch it.
SANDY Come on.
Mrs. Williams comes downstairs carrying a tray with dessert.
MRS. WILLIAMS Here you are.
MRS. WILLIAMS Would anyone like coffee?
JEFFREY That sounds great!
MRS. WILLIAMS Anyone else?.
MRS. WILLIAMS Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Mrs. Williams goes back upstairs.
Jeffrey and Sandy start eating their dessert.
Sandy watches Jeffrey happily wolf down his pie.
Mike stands up.
MIKE I'll be right back.
He leaves as if he's going to go upstairs.
Once around the corner he stops and listens to see what Jeffery and Sandy will say to one another.
SANDY Well, how did it go?.
SANDY What happened?
JEFFREY Well.
JEFFREY I've found out some things.
JEFFREY nothing really for certain.
JEFFREY There are some strange people involved.
SANDY What did you see?
JEFFREY Well.
JEFFREY Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
JEFFREY you know what I mean?
Just then, Mrs. Williams starts down with the coffee for Jeffrey.
She sees Mike at the bottom of the stairs.
This seems strange to her.
MRS. WILLIAMS Mike?.
MRS. WILLIAMS Are you alright?
Mike starts upstairs.
MIKE Yes.
Downstairs, Jeffrey and Sandy hear that Mike was close by.
Mrs. Williams and Mike pass on the stairs and Mrs. Williams enters the basement.
She throws Sandy a concerned look.
Just then, Mike calls downstairs.
MIKE Sandy?.
MIKE Could I talk to you a minute?
SANDY Sure.
SANDY just a sec.
SANDY Excuse me.
Upstairs, Mike is by the front door.
MIKE Come on out a minute, okay?
SANDY Okay.
They leave.
Downstairs Mrs. Williams picks up some dishes.
MRS. WILLIAMS Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
JEFFREY Sure thing.
JEFFREY please don't worry about me.
JEFFREY Can I help you with the dishes?
MRS. WILLIAMS Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not.
MRS. WILLIAMS just relax and enjoy your coffee.
MRS. WILLIAMS I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
Detective Williams comes to the top of the stairs and calls down.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Jeffrey?
JEFFREY Yes?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Jeffrey enters Detective Williams' study.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Take a look at these.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS These are the photos of the vacant lot where you found the ear.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS You might find them interesting.
Jeffrey begins going through the pictures.
They are 8 X 10 black and white prints.
Mostly they are pictures of weeds, but they look quite beautiful in an abstract way.
As he goes through them.
JEFFREY These are beautiful.
JEFFREY How's the case coming?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Okay.
JEFFREY Anything you can tell me?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS The criminals are winning.
JEFFREY Is that why you say it's horrible?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yes.
JEFFREY I guess you've seen some bad things.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
JEFFREY Why do you do it?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS It's an act of defiance.
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY I get it.
Suddenly Jeffrey sees something in the black and white photos.
A piece of cloth in the grass.
Carefully he asks.
JEFFREY What is this?
JEFFREY What color is it?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Blue.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS It's Blue Velvet.
Sandy comes into her father's study looking upset.
Detective Williams puts the photos away.
SANDY Can I use the car for a while?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Sure.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS What's up?
SANDY I want to buy Jeffrey a Dairy Queen.
JEFFREY A Dairy Queen?
JEFFREY Oh yeah?
JEFFREY Sure, that sounds great.
Jeffrey gets in and Sandy starts the car.
She pulls out.
They drive away.
JEFFREY What's with Mike?
SANDY He got a little jealous.
JEFFREY I'm sorry, I didn't.
SANDY It's okay.
SANDY Don't worry about it.
The car glides along.
Jeffrey and Sandy smile at one another.
They drive on.
SANDY You want a Dairy Queen?
JEFFREY No way.
JEFFREY I'm about to blow up.
Sandy laughs as she pulls the car curbside in a quiet street by a church.
The church pipe-organ music drifts softly into the night.
SANDY You want to tell me about it?
JEFFREY OK.
JEFFREY It's a strange world, Sandy.
JEFFREY this is what I have found out.
JEFFREY What I think I have found out.
JEFFREY Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don.
JEFFREY they have a son.
JEFFREY I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears.
JEFFREY I think he is holding them to make her do things for him.
JEFFREY I think she wants to die.
JEFFREY the ears were for her a warning to stay alive.
JEFFREY there is another man involved.
JEFFREY I call him the "yellow man".
JEFFREY you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door.
JEFFREY I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank.
JEFFREY Frank is a very dangerous man.
SANDY Wow.
SANDY Should you tell my father?
JEFFREY I don't see how I can.
JEFFREY and I can't prove any of this.
JEFFREY I got all this information illegally.
JEFFREY also it could get you in trouble.
SANDY You saw a lot in one night.
JEFFREY Actually.
JEFFREY I've been in twice.
SANDY Twice.
SANDY without her sensing anything?
JEFFREY Yes.
SANDY Did you see her undressed?
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY I mean.
JEFFREY a little, .
JEFFREY you know.
SANDY Yeah?
JEFFREY That doesn't bother you, does it?
SANDY Who, me?
SANDY Why should it?
JEFFREY That's what I thought.
SANDY You're sure right.
SANDY It is a strange world.
JEFFREY Why are there people like Frank.
JEFFREY Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
SANDY I don't know.
SANDY I had a dream.
SANDY in fact.
SANDY the night I met you.
SANDY in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins.
SANDY you know, birds.
SANDY robins stood for love.
SANDY and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love.
SANDY and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference.
SANDY I guess.
SANDY until the robins come there is trouble.
JEFFREY Yeah I guess so.
JEFFREY You're a neat girl.
SANDY So are you.
SANDY I mean you're a neat guy.
SANDY We better get back.
JEFFREY I guess so.
JEFFREY you want to help me watch Frank?.
JEFFREY I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow.
JEFFREY with a camera.
Sandy starts the car and pulls out into the street.
They begin driving back.
SANDY No, silly - I'm still in school you know.
SANDY but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned.
SANDY You better be careful, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY I will.
JEFFREY I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
They pull up in front of Jeffrey's house.
SANDY Okay.
SANDY be careful.
JEFFREY Okay, Sandy.
Jeffrey gets out of the car.
He goes around to her side and looks down at her in the car.
She looks very beautiful.
He stands there for a moment.
JEFFREY Can I give you a kiss good night?
SANDY You better not, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY okay.
SANDY Goodnight.
JEFFREY See ya tomorrow.
Sandy slowly drives off.
Jeffrey watches her go then turns and goes inside his house.
The house is very dark and quiet.
Jeffrey finds a note by the one table light is on.
The note is from his mother.
It reads, "Jeffrey hope you enjoyed yourself.
See you at breakfast.
Love Mom."
A postscript is written on the note by Aunt Barbara.
"Jeffrey, honey, I found these.
Love, Aunt Barbara."
Jeffrey sees that Aunt Barbara has left him two dead termites.
He picks one up and studies it.
Again we see a huge CLOSEUP of a termite in the half-light.
Jeffrey shakes his head in amusement.
Jeffrey paces nervously.
He picks up the phone and mouthing the numbers he dials Dorothy's number.
There is a "click" but no one speaks.
Jeffrey instinctively speaks.
JEFFREY Hello?
FRANK (telephone V.O.) Speak to me Fucker.
Jeffrey hangs up immediately.
He's scared.
JEFFREY Stupid!!
JEFFREY So stupid.
JEFFREY now she might be in even more trouble with Frank.
JEFFREY I hope not.
JEFFREY I hope not.
JEFFREY tomorrow I have to find out more about Frank.
Jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front door of Frank Booth's apartment building.
The camera is covered with a cardboard shoe box.
Jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching.
A LADY steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps.
Jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two pictures.
We see a MAN walk down the street and turn up the steps.
Jeffrey shoots, but really only gets the back of the man.
Damn!
He replaces the cardboard box and continues eating.
Later in the day.
Jeffrey sits waiting.
He looks at his watch.
It says
As he looks up he sees Frank getting out of a car with another man.
the Yellow Man.
They head for Frank's building.
Jeffrey hurriedly removes the shoe box and begins snapping pictures.
They mount the steps and disappear within the old dark structure.
JEFFREY Wow.
Jeffrey's watch - the hand - time lapses around to 3:00.
JEFFREY Fifteen more minutes.
Just then, he sees movement and takes the box off the camera.
He starts shooting as TWO MEN come out the door.
It is the Yellow Man and a man who is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache.
He carries an alligator-skin briefcase FRANK HAS DISAPPEARED.
Both are talking together and now laughing.
Jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to cover the camera as they approach.
The box falls.
The Yellow Man looks, but Jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the glove compartment.
The two men walk right by Jeffrey and get into the car behind his.
Jeffrey decides to follow them.
He waits a few seconds and starts off.
They drive through town.
to a large factory building, park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building.
Jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them.
At a metal landing they stop.
He sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the distance.
The man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the Yellow Man at what he sees.
He grips the Yellow Man on the shoulder.
Jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point.
He looks at his watch.
"3:25".
JEFFREY You gotta wait for me Sandy.
JEFFREY I'm on a real roll.
He quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase.
then he goes down an alley in the direction they were looking.
At the end of the alley he turns left and stops short.
He sees a crowd of people, an ambulance, and two police cars.
He walks closer.
Through the crowd he sees a broken window.
Hanging in the window is a dead man.
Blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head.
On the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock.
Her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head in horrible positions.
Jeffrey stands next to two black guys.
Suddenly one of the police officers start pushing everyone away.
Jeffrey turns to them.
JEFFREY What happened?
GUY #1 He was blown away man.
GUY #1 can't you see?
GUY #2 That cracker was the biggest dealer in this section of the city, brother.
GUY #2 the police are going to find more drugs in there than you can believe.
GUY #2 It's a speedball heaven in there.
JEFFREY Oh yeah?
JEFFREY What about the woman?
GUY #1 Probably just a whore he happened to be with at the time.
JEFFREY Man oh brother.
GUY #1 This is the way the world is my man.
GUY #1 take a good look.
Jeffrey takes a last look before checking his watch and hurrying off.
Jeffrey drives up to the corner where Sandy is standing.
She is frantically looking around.
Jeffrey stops for her.
Jeffrey looks around.
A big FOOTBALL PLAYER is running up to a chain link fence across the street, but it's too late - Mike sees Jeffrey.
Everything stops for a moment.
Then, Mike runs off.
SANDY Oh great.
Sandy goes around and gets in the car.
SANDY You were late.
JEFFREY I'm really sorry.
SANDY What am I going to do?
JEFFREY You want to go talk to him?
SANDY Yeah, but.
SANDY I don't think it's going to do much good.
SANDY Let's go.
SANDY I'll try to talk to him later.
Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in the diner in a different booth, but having the same things as before.
SANDY You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
JEFFREY That's what makes it so good.
JEFFREY You wanta hear what I saw today?
SANDY Shoot.
JEFFREY Number one.
JEFFREY I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank.
JEFFREY Now.
JEFFREY the only trouble is.
JEFFREY what does this prove?
SANDY Nothing really, but it's interesting.
SANDY they know each other.
SANDY they seem to like each other.
JEFFREY Maybe.
JEFFREY But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs.
JEFFREY I think Frank supplies him.
SANDY Oh yeah?
JEFFREY Number two.
JEFFREY I saw the Yellow Man come out.
JEFFREY This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase.
JEFFREY They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance.
JEFFREY Number three.
JEFFREY now get this.
JEFFREY In the distance was a murder.
JEFFREY a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
SANDY Jeffrey!!
JEFFREY Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
SANDY I can't believe what you are finding out.
SANDY Are you going to continue with this.
SANDY Are you going back to her apartment?
JEFFREY Yeah.
SANDY Jeffrey?.
SANDY Why?
JEFFREY I'm seeing something that was always hidden.
JEFFREY I'm involved in a mystery.
JEFFREY I'm learning.
JEFFREY and it's all secret.
SANDY You like mysteries that much?
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY you're a mystery.
JEFFREY I like you.
JEFFREY very much.
Jeffrey stands up and moves to her side of the booth.
They stare at each other.
SANDY Oh yeah?
Jeffrey leans over and kisses her gently.
She pulls away.
SANDY Don't.
SANDY please, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey looks at her for a moment.
JEFFREY You worry about me really?
SANDY Yes.
SANDY is that so surprising?.
SANDY Yeah I worry.
SANDY a lot.
SANDY I got you into this.
Jeffrey winds his way up the staircase of Dorothy's apartment building.
He hesitates before crossing to Dorothy's door.
He knocks on the door and Dorothy opens it.
DOROTHY Come in.
JEFFREY Hello.
Dorothy closes the door.
She chains it.
They kiss.
The kiss gets hotter.
The feeling begins.
They move down the hall to the back bedroom.
They've never made love there.
As they hurriedly undress Jeffrey sees the pointed child's hat with the propeller.
He picks it up and spins the propeller.
It makes a bit of music.
Dorothy shrieks as she lurches toward Jeffrey grabbing his hand, stopping him from turning the tiny propeller.
She gains some control of herself.
Jeffrey releases the hat into her hand.
DOROTHY It used to make me laugh .but.
JEFFREY I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
DOROTHY Yes.
DOROTHY Frank-
JEFFREY Frank is coming?
DOROTHY No.
DOROTHY how could he?.
DOROTHY Don't go.
DOROTHY You think I'm crazy, don't you?
DOROTHY I want you to stay.
DOROTHY don't hate me.
JEFFREY I sure don't hate you.
DOROTHY I'm not crazy.
DOROTHY I know the difference between right and wrong.
JEFFREY That's good.
Jeffrey moves to get out of bed.
DOROTHY Do you like my body?
JEFFREY Sure I do.
She moves closer to him, towards his back touching it with her tongue.
She gets down in a pose and holds it.
DOROTHY I'm a statue.
DOROTHY you can feel me.you can do anything you want.
Jeffrey's hands find her flesh and move about.
Jeffrey and Dorothy are making love in her bed in almost total darkness.
DOROTHY What do you want to do?
JEFFREY I'm doing it.
DOROTHY Are you a bad boy?
JEFFREY Whatiya mean?
DOROTHY Do you want to do bad things?
DOROTHY Anything.
DOROTHY anything.
JEFFREY What do you want?
DOROTHY I want you to hurt me.
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY I told you.
JEFFREY I don't want to hurt you.
JEFFREY I want to help you.
JEFFREY I think I know some of what is happening to you.
JEFFREY Dorothy?
JEFFREY Frank has your husband and son.
JEFFREY Dorothy?
JEFFREY Doesn't he?
JEFFREY You have to do something Dorothy.
JEFFREY go to the police.
DOROTHY No police!!!.
DOROTHY No police!!
Suddenly, Dorothy gets very odd.
She turns into a little girl.
She has a frightening little girl smile.
DOROTHY You like to open me.
DOROTHY don't you?
JEFFREY Yes.
DOROTHY What if I told Frank that you opened me?
For just one quiet moment we see the stairway to Dorothy's apartment.
It is empty.
Then back to Jeffrey and Dorothy.
JEFFREY That wouldn't be too good, would it?
DOROTHY Frank would open you.
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY I know you've been scared.
JEFFREY now you want to scare someone.
DOROTHY Does that scare you?
JEFFREY Shut up.
DOROTHY Beeeee careful.
JEFFREY Come on Dorothy.
DOROTHY What if Frank came over here and found us?
The curtains in the kitchen bellow out with an eerie gust of wind.
JEFFREY Look, snap out of it, will ya?
DOROTHY Kiss me.
They kiss.
DOROTHY Do you love me?
JEFFREY Do you love me?
DOROTHY I asked first.
JEFFREY Sometimes I think I do.
DOROTHY And sometimes you think you don't?!
DOROTHY Well, get away then!
She bolts up.
JEFFREY Wait a minute.
JEFFREY Wait.
JEFFREY Whatiya want?
JEFFREY For cryin' out loud!
DOROTHY Just get outta my bed.
She hits out at Jeffrey and strikes him in the face.
Jeffrey struggles with her to keep her from hitting him again but she breaks loose and slams out at his face again.
He pushes back hard and her head actually hits the wall.
She smiles through the pain.
JEFFREY Oh God.
JEFFREY are you alright.
She falls on him and smothers him with kisses.
DOROTHY See.
DOROTHY see how you hurt me?
DOROTHY Now.
DOROTHY Open me.
DOROTHY enter me.
Jeffrey moves on top of her in the darkness.
We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper into it.
DOROTHY I love you Don with all my heart.
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY it's not Don.
But he can't stop himself or her from making love.
DOROTHY Come inside me.
DOROTHY Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
DOROTHY Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
The movement subsides.
There is silence in the room, except for breathing.
JEFFREY I didn't mean to hurt you.
DOROTHY Shhhhhh.
DOROTHY Now I have your disease.
JEFFREY You.
JEFFREY what?
DOROTHY You put your disease in me.
DOROTHY your semen.
DOROTHY it's hot and full of disease.
JEFFREY There's no disease, I can tell you.
DOROTHY Men are crazy.
DOROTHY then they put their craziness into me.
DOROTHY then it makes me crazy.
DOROTHY then they aren't so crazy for awhile.
DOROTHY then they put their craziness in me again.
DOROTHY it's burning me.
DOROTHY but I love you.
DOROTHY I do, I do.
DOROTHY Did you know that?
DOROTHY Did you know that I love you?
JEFFREY I'm glad you do.
DOROTHY There's so much I want to tell you.
DOROTHY I'm in so much darkness though with things moving.
DOROTHY there is darkness sucking me.
DOROTHY It's kissing me and darkness is entering me.
DOROTHY in every hole.
DOROTHY It's opening me to a death.
JEFFREY Dorothy.
JEFFREY no!
DOROTHY If I die, then they'll be free.
DOROTHY It's getting late, isn't it?
DOROTHY I can tell.
DOROTHY it's a cold feeling when it's late.
DOROTHY It's warm then it gets cold.
DOROTHY Jeffrey.
DOROTHY I feel it getting cold.
JEFFREY You called me Jeffrey.
DOROTHY I did.
DOROTHY are you?
JEFFREY Yes.
DOROTHY Why are you here?
DOROTHY Hmmmmmmmm!!!!
DOROTHY Ok.
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY not really.
JEFFREY but also because I really want you to be alright.
Dorothy stops and looks at him - she holds his face.
She starts to cry.
DOROTHY You do .you really do.
She continues holding his face - looking in his eyes crying openly.
he pulls him down to her.
DOROTHY Jeffrey.
DOROTHY Jeffrey.
DOROTHY Jeffrey.
Jeffrey smiles.
JEFFREY I guess I should go.
DOROTHY I want you to stay with me.
JEFFREY I think I better go.
Later.
Jeffrey is dressed and Dorothy comes out of the bathroom in her robe.
She is combing her hair.
One or two lights are on now.
She looks at Jeffrey and smiles, brushes some of his hair back from his face.
DOROTHY You're my special friend, aren't you?
DOROTHY I have you inside of me still.
DOROTHY It helps me.
DOROTHY I need you.
Jeffrey doesn't know what to say.
He starts walking toward the door with Dorothy beside him.
JEFFREY I'll call you.
DOROTHY Okay.
DOROTHY soon?
DOROTHY Do you think I'm too fat?
JEFFREY What?
DOROTHY I'm getting a little bit fat.
DOROTHY I hate that.
JEFFREY You look beautiful to me.
She pats her hips.
DOROTHY Right in here.
DOROTHY fat, fat, fat.
Dorothy takes the chain off the door and opens it.
The hall is empty.
There is some noise on the stairs.
Suddenly, Frank and TWO FRIENDS of his come into view on the stairway.
JEFFREY Oh no.
DOROTHY No.
DOROTHY Hi baby.
FRANK Who's this fuck?
DOROTHY He's a friend.
DOROTHY from the neighborhood.
DOROTHY we were just talking.
FRANK From the neighborhood?
FRANK Shut the fuck up.
FRANK You like telephones?
FRANK Huh?.
FRANK You wanta go for a ride?
JEFFREY No thanks.
FRANK No thanks.
FRANK what does that mean?
JEFFREY I don't want to go.
FRANK Go where?
JEFFREY On a ride.
FRANK A ride?.
FRANK Hell, that's a good idea.
FRANK okay, let's go.
FRANK Hey, let's go.
Frank grabs Jeffrey and pulls him along.
FRANK Come on.
FRANK We're goin' for a joy ride.
Frank takes Jeffrey on a wide-eyed terror walk down the stairway.
Frank and Dorothy are in the front seat.
Jeffrey is sandwiched between two very dirty strange guys in the back.
Frank is driving very fast and very crazy.
Sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which periodically blares out police reports.
At the lights, when they turn green, Frank lays rubber.
FRANK Where you wanna go?
FRANK I know!.
FRANK We gotta see Ben.
FRANK We gotta, right?
PAUL Yeah.
PAUL we gotta see Ben.
The car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs.
Liquor and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors.
They are blurred visions because of the speed of Frank's car.
Driving music plays.
Frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets, just barely making turns.
The Ford bounces off several curbs.
Dorothy occasionally steals a glance back at Jeffrey.
She squeals out loud - sometimes with glee, mostly in fear.
Raymond and Paul laugh with Frank, yell out or light cigarettes.
Frank finally gets to where he's going - a corner bar - and skids to a hault.
They all pile out.
Frank grabs Jeffrey.
FRANK Come on.
FRANK I wancha to meet a frienda mine.
FRANK Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
RAYMOND Okay Frank.
FRANK What kinda beer do you like?
JEFFREY Heineken.
He grabs Jeffrey and pushes him into the bar.
Moving fast now, they go through this dark frightening place.
Frank has Jeffrey by the neck forcing him faster.
In the back there is a black man fondling a white girl near a doorway.
They go through the door to a back room.
A few naked girls are there near beds with curtains around them.
One girl lies on her bed with dried vomit around her head and pillow.
Suddenly Frank spots his friend Willard.
He runs toward him violently and grabs him by the throat.
FRANK Hey shithead.
FRANK that's the last time I get you high and watch you freak out - motherfucker you tore my coat and I lost my lucky piece of blue velvet, man.
FLASHBACK to the black and white photo of a piece of cloth in the weeds in the vacant lot.
JEFFREY (V.O.) What color is it?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (V.O.) It's blue.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (V.O.) blue velvet.
WILLARD Hey Frank I'm sorry buddy.
FRANK Yeah?.
FRANK get ready for a love letter.
FRANK When you least expect it.
WILLARD Frank.
WILLARD please man.
FRANK A big love letter.
Frank pushes him down on the bed with the dried vomit whore.
They leave Willard.
...
and go up a flight of dirty wooden steps.
Frank bangs on a door at the first landing.
Raymond joins him with a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer.
FRANK Hey Ben.
FRANK OPEN UP.
FRANK It's Frank.
A tall, slender man with a smoking jacket and a mustache opens the door.
It's BEN.
His voice is very horse from years of smoking.
BEN Frank.
BEN Come in.
FRANK Hey, I brought some friends.
FRANK and some beer.
BEN Fine.
BEN Welcome.
BEN Come sit down.
The apartment is very large.
All the furniture is over-stuffed.
In the room there is a very much over-weight WOMAN dressed in black and a greasy-looking COUPLE.
On the couch, a YOUNG WOMAN plays with a large doll.
FRANK Suave.
FRANK goddam are you suave, you fucker.
FRANK You want some beer?
BEN Certainly Frank.
BEN Darling, get some glasses.
BEN We'll have some beer with Frank.
BEN Won't you sit down?
Everyone kinds of mills around.
Paul sits down in a chair and starts laughing at some private joke in his head.
FRANK Shit Ben!
FRANK How the shit are ya?
BEN Fine Frank.
BEN Fine.
BEN How are you?
FRANK Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good.
FRANK You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here, (referring to Jeffrey) is a neighbor.
FRANK What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know.
FRANK goddam!!!(referring to Ben) This is the suavest guy I know.
FRANK look at you.
FRANK You're one beautiful fucker, Ben.
FRANK I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours.
FRANK shit, that is too fuckin' much.
FRANK Where's those glasses.
FRANK this beer's gonna get too warm.
FRANK I can't stand fuckin' warm beer.
FRANK it makes me puke.
BEN Darling, where are the glasses?.
BEN Oh.
BEN here they are.
The Big Lady brings the glasses in and sets them on the card table.
She looks worried.
She gives a helpless pleading look to Ben.
FRANK Raymond!
FRANK Where's the fuckin' beer?
RAYMOND Right here Frank.
RAYMOND You want me to pour it?
FRANK No, I want ya to fuck it.
FRANK Shit, yes.
FRANK pour the fuckin' beer.
RAYMOND There ya go.
FRANK Good, let's drink up.
BEN To your health, Frank.
FRANK Shit.
FRANK let's drink to something else.
FRANK let's drink to fuckin'.
FRANK Say here's to your fuck Frank.
BEN If you like Frank.
BEN Here's to your fuck.
BEN cheers.
Frank's friends, Paul and Raymod, laugh.
FRANK Cheers.
FRANK Suave man.
FRANK you're so fuckin' suave.
FRANK WE LOVE BEN!
FRANK Here's to Ben!.
Frank slaps Jeffrey in the face.
FRANK Hey neighbor.
FRANK Here's to Ben.
JEFFREY Here's to Ben.
FRANK Do you see, Ben?.
FRANK I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
Ben goes to Jeffrey.
BEN Thank you neighbor.
BEN let me see your face.
BEN did he hurt you?
Jeffrey shows him.
BEN Oh.
BEN my.
Suddenly Ben slugs Jeffrey in the stomach.
Jeffrey doubles over.
BEN Is that any better?
Frank almost dies laughing.
Everyone else joins in.
Ben turns to Frank.
BEN Frank, I have something for you.
BEN Excuse us everyone.
FRANK EXCUSE US por favor!
FRANK Hey.
FRANK let Tits see her kid.
As Jeffrey tries to catch his breath, he sees tremendous emotion fill Dorothy's face.
She rushes forward.
Raymond grabs her by the arm and takes her into another room.
Jeffrey hears her crying out.
He hears a small boy.
DOROTHY (V.O.) Donny, oh my Donny.
DONNY (V.O.) Mommy!
Dorothy is sobbing and clinging to Donny.
He is crying and gripping her like a small monkey would grip its mother.
Suddenly Donny breaks away, screaming.
Mommy.
You left me.
you stopped loving me.
FRANK Okay.
FRANK let's hit the fuckin' road.
FRANK we're givin' our neighbor a joy ride.
FRANK let's get on with it.
FRANK Bye, Ben.
FRANK Ya wanna go on a joy ride with us, anyone?
FRANK You?
Dorothy rejoins the group.
She's in a state of shock.
Frank pinches her cheek.
FRANK No smile for Frank?
FRANK No?
FRANK Okay, fuck it.
FRANK Let's go.
FRANK Oh you wanna come with Raymond?
Raymond has picked up the greasy girl.
BEN See you Tuesday, Frank.
FRANK Right Ben.
FRANK LET'S GO FUCK.
FRANK I'll fuck anything that moves.
They leave and pile back into the car.
Now there are four in the back.
Raymond starts necking with the Greasy Girl.
They speed on into the night.
Frank drives through various dark streets.
then out onto a highway and goes over 100 mph down a two-lane highway.
FRANK Hey?
FRANK You like to walk.
JEFFREY What?
FRANK Let's take our neighbor out.
FRANK Let him fuckin' walk back.
As Frank is driving Jeffrey sees Dorothy nervously look at the road and surrounding countryside, then questioningly at Frank.
She senses something about where they are going.
DOROTHY Where are we going, Frank?
FRANK Hey.
FRANK Tits.
FRANK I'm taking your neighbor to the country.
FRANK maybe something for you too.
DOROTHY Frank?
FRANK You want to see him too, right?
DOROTHY Yes, but.
FRANK Then, shut up!
Frank sees Dorothy look back at Jeffrey.
FRANK Hey.
FRANK What's this fuck got to do with anything.
Frank angrily swerves the car off onto a small dirt road bouncing down it, screeching to a halt near an orchard of trees.
He turns violently around to Jeffrey.
FRANK What are you lookin' at?
JEFFREY Nothing.
FRANK Don't look at me, Fuck.
FRANK I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.
FRANK You like me?.
Jeffrey is quiet.
FRANK Look at these.
FRANK What are these?
DOROTHY Come on, Frank.
DOROTHY Let's go.
DOROTHY Please.
Frank is doing something to Dorothy's chest but Jeffrey can't see.
FRANK Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead.
FRANK WHAT ARE
DOROTHY Those are my breasts.
FRANK Can I feel 'em?
DOROTHY If you want to.
Frank takes helium.
FRANK Baby wants to pinch 'em.
She winces and tries to pull away.
FRANK What's the matter?
FRANK Give 'em back.
FRANK They're just a little red, that's all.
FRANK let me feel 'em again.
FRANK Come here.
Frank pulls her over and starts to pinch her again.
It really hurts her and she is frightened and in pain.
JEFFREY Hey.
JEFFREY leave her alone.
Frank pretends not to hear Jeffrey and pinches Dorothy's breasts real hard.
She stifles a scream.
Jeffrey gets mad.
He hits Frank hard in the face.
Everyone is deadly silent as Frank turns to Jeffrey.
Frank stares at Jeffrey.
FRANK NEXT!
FRANK out of the car fuck.
FRANK HELP HIM
Frank gets out and presses his face against the rear window.
His distorted face is hideous.
He opens the back door.
Raymond and Paul grab Jeffrey and pull him out of the car.
The Greasy Girl laughs nervously.
DOROTHY Frank.
DOROTHY he didn't mean it.
DOROTHY Leave him alone.
DOROTHY come on.
DOROTHY He didn't mean it.
FRANK Shut up.
FRANK Gimme your lipstick.
FRANK Hey, pretty, pretty.
Dorothy doesn't move fast enough so Frank dumps her whole purse out on the front seat and grabs the lipstick and a flashlight.
He puts lipstick heavy onto his lips.
While Raymond and Paul hold Jeffrey.
Frank kisses Jeffrey all over the mouth.
Jeffrey tries to hit Frank and pull away, but Raymond and Paul have a hold of him.
Jeffrey looks very strange with these big blotches of red lipstick on his face and mouth.
Frank slams the front door shut to muffle Dorothy.
He grabs Jeffrey and presses his frightened face against the front window.
Then, the back window.
Then, he flops Jeffrey up on the hood with Paul's help and presses Jeffrey's face against the rear window.
Inside the car, this show is crazy and scary.
Then, Frank takes Jeffrey over to the side of the car again.
FRANK You're fuckin' lucky to be alive.
Raymond pulls Jeffrey's face back so he's looking at Frank.
Dorothy and the Greasy Girl watch in terror.
FRANK Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter.
FRANK straight from my heart, fucker.
FRANK You know what a love letter is?
FRANK It's a bullet.
FRANK straight from my gun, fucker.
FRANK Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever.
FRANK Understand, Fuck?
JEFFREY Yes.
FRANK I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Frank takes a small square of blue velvet out of his pocket and begins feeling Jeffrey's face with it.
FRANK You feel good.
FRANK feel my muscles.
Raymond makes Jeffrey raise his arm and Jeffrey feels Frank's biceps.
FRANK You like that?
Hold him tight for me.
Suddenly Frank starts hitting Jeffrey in the face.
Dorothy screams at the car window.
JEFFREY'S P.O.V. of rocks on the ground.
He slowly picks up and looks around.
The car is gone.
He is swollen, bloody, and covered with lipstick.
His pants have been pulled down and "FUCK YOU" has been written with lipstick on his legs.
He struggles to his feet and pulls his pants up.
He fastens his belt and begins limping up the dirt road highway.
Jeffrey dials.
JEFFREY Yellow Cab?
JEFFREY Is this Yellow Cab?
JEFFREY I need a cab.
JEFFREY on Route 7.
JEFFREY Just by Meadow Lane.
Jeffrey remembers Dorothy mentioning "Meadow Lane" on the phone.
Jeffrey remembers Frank saying "You want to see him too, right?" and Dorothy saying, "Yes.
but."
JEFFREY Meadow Lane.
JEFFREY There's a big Nehi sign.
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY I'll wait, don't worry, .
JEFFREY I've got to get home, don't I?
Jeffrey is sleeping.
His face is swollen and bruised.
The clock says 4:30 p.m.
The clock says 1:30 a.m.
Jeffrey goes into the bathroom.
Looks at his puffed face and takes two aspirin.
He stumbles back to bed.
The clock says 7:30 a.m.
and Jeffrey gets up and stretches.
JEFFREY Owww.
His muscles are very sore.
At the breakfast table.
Aunt Barbara and Mrs. Beaumont are staring at Jeffrey.
JEFFREY I don't want to talk about it.
JEFFREY Everything's okay now.
JEFFREY I don't want to talk about it.
AUNT BARBARA Sometimes it helps to talk things over.
AUNT BARBARA for instance, many marriages are saved by.
JEFFREY Aunt Barbara.
JEFFREY I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
He holds his fist up.
Jeffrey dials the phone.
JEFFREY Mrs. Williams?
JEFFREY Hi, this is Jeffrey Beaumont.
JEFFREY fine and you?
JEFFREY Good.
JEFFREY Is Sandy there?
JEFFREY Good, thanks.
JEFFREY Sandy?.
JEFFREY Can you talk?

SANDY Jeffrey.
SANDY are they important things?
SANDY Well forget me - you have to tell him.
SANDY Jeffrey.
SANDY I mean it.
JEFFREY Ok but I promise I won't mention you.
JEFFREY Okay?
JEFFREY .I'll see him at the police station.
JEFFREY okay?
JEFFREY See you Friday night, if not before.
Jeffrey climbs the stairs up to Detective Williams' office.
He rounds the corner and steps inside the office, when he stops short with fear.
Detective Williams is not there, but sitting at a desk next to Detective Williams' desk is the Yellow Man.
Their eyes lock.
Jeffrey freezes.
JEFFREY Excuse me.
Jeffrey turns away as quickly as possible and goes over to a water cooler and gets a drink, keeping his back to the Yellow Man.
He shakes with fear.
He slowly turns around.
The Yellow Man is studying some papers on his desk.
Again the Yellow Man looks up.
This time he is slightly suspicious and he cooks his head.
Jeffrey cannot move.
Finally, Jeffrey is able to step away.
As he leaves the Yellow Man's line of sight, Jeffrey catches the names on the door.
JEFFREY Gordon.
JEFFREY Gordon.
JEFFREY a police inspector.
JEFFREY wait a minute.
JEFFREY wait a minute.
Jeffrey remembers the black guy saying: "The police are going to find more drugs in there than you can believe."
JEFFREY The police.
JEFFREY the police.
JEFFREY Gordon.
Jeffrey remembers Frank's voice in the distance: "Gordon went right up to them - in broad daylight of course - 'cause he's the man, right?
And he took all those drugs away."
JEFFREY Took all those drugs away.
JEFFREY Gordon took those drugs away.
Jeffrey walks through the darkness, carrying the photos.
He stops in front of Detective Williams' house and hesitates.
Jeffrey's face has a troubled look.
He approaches the front door.
He hesitates again before finally knocking.
Detective Williams answers the door.
Sandy is in the background.
When she sees the look on Jeffrey's face, she knows why he's there.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Jeffrey!
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Come on in.
JEFFREY Hi.
JEFFREY Hi Sandy.
JEFFREY I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Okay.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS come on in.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Looks like you had a bad face lift.
JEFFREY Yeah.
Sandy gives him a concerned look.
Jeffrey follows Detective Williams to his study.
He closes the door behind him.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Okay?
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY I gotta tell you.
JEFFREY I've.
JEFFREY discovered some things.
JEFFREY .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them.
JEFFREY The first picture is this.
He shows him the picture of Frank and studies Detective Williams' face as he sees it.
JEFFREY This is Frank Booth.
JEFFREY His address is on the back of the photo.
JEFFREY He, in my opinion, is very sick and dangerous.
JEFFREY This photo here is of Frank with another man as they went into Frank's apartment.
Jeffrey casually hands the photo over and watches Detective Williams' face extra carefully.
Detective Williams doesn't flinch, yet his eyes slowly glide upwards to meet Jeffrey's.
JEFFREY And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy.
JEFFREY here's the photo.
JEFFREY I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people.
JEFFREY I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
JEFFREY I have no hard proof of any of this.
JEFFREY Her address is also on the photos.
JEFFREY I think these people are involved with drugs.
JEFFREY and murder.
JEFFREY I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.
JEFFREY and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs.
JEFFREY I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure.
JEFFREY .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
JEFFREY I can't tell you the whole story.
JEFFREY I.
JEFFREY I took it upon myself.
JEFFREY I can't say more.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Is Sandy part of this?
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY not at all.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Who knows you have these?
JEFFREY Only you.
JEFFREY and the photo lab.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS You're all through with this now?
JEFFREY Yes sir.
JEFFREY I sure am.
Detective Williams studies Jeffrey, then the photos.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS For now.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Alright.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS you better be.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
JEFFREY Yes sir.
Jeffrey leaves the study.
In the living room, Jeffrey looks at Sandy.
SANDY Everything okay?
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY I think so.
JEFFREY I just had to tell him some of what I knew.
JEFFREY Is Friday still on?
SANDY You didn't tell him about me?
JEFFREY No.
Detective Williams comes out of his study and sees the two of them talking.
He sees some nervousness.
Sandy quickly changes the subject.
SANDY I should never had gotten you going on this.
SANDY Yes Jeffrey.
SANDY Friday's on!
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY great!
Jeffrey waters the flowers and bushes as his father had done.
His face looks much better.
Jeffrey sits and visits with his father.
His Mother and his Aunt Barbara are there too.
CLOSEUPS of cells moving - dark cells move in - the picture gets dark.
Jeffrey is driving over to Sandy's.
He has to park across the street because a police car is sitting in front of the Williams' house.
Its lights are slowly revolving on top.
The engine idles.
a Man is inside.
his head down, studying some papers.
Jeffrey barely notices all this, as he heads for the door.
Mrs. Williams answers the door and Sandy is behind her in the dining room.
MRS. WILLIAMS Hello, Jeffrey.
MRS. WILLIAMS Come in.
Jeffrey enters and crosses the room to Sandy.
JEFFREY You all set?
Detective Williams comes in arranging some papers which he begins placing in a briefcase on the dining room table.
Just then a man comes up to the door which is still open.
Jeffrey turns to see.
It is Detective T.R.
Gordon, the Yellow Man.
All the color instantly drains from Jeffrey's face.
YELLOW MAN Hey John - get a move on!!
Detective Williams turns.
He sees Detective Gordon.
He turns again.
He sees Jeffrey's expression.
Sandy hasn't seen it yet.
Detective Williams goes to Jeffrey.
He looks him straight in the eye.
He also positions himself between Jeffrey and T.R. Gordon.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Easy does it Jeffrey.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Behave yourself.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS don't blow it.
Sandy becomes curious and moves over to Jeffrey and her father.
Jeffrey decides to trust Detective Williams.
The Yellow Man (T.R.
Gordon) yells again.
YELLOW MAN Come on John, get it in gear pal!
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS So long Jeffrey.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS You two have a nice night, okay?
JEFFREY Okay.
SANDY What is it?
JEFFREY Just some fatherly advice.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS That's right.
Jeffrey and Sandy head for the door.
The Yellow Man's and Jeffrey's eyes meet once more.
The Yellow Man cocks his head.
thinking.
No recognition.
SANDY Goodnight mom.
SANDY Goodnight Tom.
T.R. GORDON-YELLOW MAN Goodnight, Sandy.
They cross the yard to the car.
Jeffrey helps Sandy in, then goes around and gets in himself.
They are both dressed very nicely.
Jeffrey starts the car and pulls out.
SANDY What was that all about?
JEFFREY Nothing.
JEFFREY really!
JEFFREY It's good to see you.
SANDY It's good to see you.
JEFFREY Where to?
SANDY Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista.
SANDY It's not far.
SANDY Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
JEFFREY I'd rather not talk about it.
JEFFREY I'll tell you about it sometime.
SANDY It's okay.
JEFFREY ...
JEFFREY You look beautiful.
SANDY Thank you.
SANDY Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
JEFFREY I like that idea.
JEFFREY that's a real good idea.
Jeffrey and Sandy go downstairs to a basement which is dark and crowded with kids dancing and talking.
Jeffrey and Sandy are holding hands.
Jeffrey feels a little out of place.
A COUPLE OF GIRLS raise their eyebrows and give approving looks to Sandy.
The music is loud, fast dancing music.
SANDY You want to dance?
JEFFREY I can't dance fast.
SANDY Really?
JEFFREY Really.
JEFFREY you want to dance with someone else?
JEFFREY Let's wait for some slow one.
SANDY Just a minute.
Sandy leaves Jeffrey for a moment and Jeffrey watches her make her way through the crowd to a GIRL by the record player.
Sandy confers with the girl.
Sandy comes back to Jeffrey.
SANDY Don't worry.
SANDY I took care of it.
SANDY You want something to drink?
Just then, the music goes slow.
JEFFREY You want to dance?
SANDY Okay.
They begin to dance.
At first, further apart, then, they make the mistake of looking in each other's eyes and they move very close together.
They move around to another look.
Then they kiss.
They kiss for the entire rest of the song.
Between songs and during the entire next song.
They finally, as they say, come up for air.
SANDY I love you, Jeffrey.
They kiss again.
Then they dance and look at each other.
Then they hug each other.
As they hug, Jeffrey closes his eyes.
JEFFREY I really do love you.
Later.
Jeffrey gives Sandy a little kiss while they're over by the cokes.
They're having a drink.
Sandy introduces Jeffrey to some of her friends.
She is very proud of him.
They are both very happy.
They look at each other and kiss again.
Later.
The party is breaking up.
Kids are beginning to go upstairs and go out the front doors to their cars.
Jeffrey and Sandy are coming up stairs arm in arm.
They say goodnight to the PARENTS in the living room and leave through the front door.
They can't take their eyes off one another.
They are totally oblivious to the THREE GUYS in a car across the street.
As soon as Jeffrey gets Sandy and himself in his car, he starts it and moves off.
The dark car comes to life with a loud low roar and peels out with a scream.
It follows Jeffrey and Sandy for a way, then it roars up behind them swaying back and forth, honking its horn and trying to ram Jeffrey's car in the rear.
Jeffrey looks frantically in the rear view mirror.
Sandy turns around in fear.
Jeffrey guns his car and races down the street.
SANDY Oh my God.
SANDY What's wrong?
JEFFREY Frank!!
He swerves around the corner.
Up ahead, a car is pulling out of a driveway.
(continuing; referring to the car ahead) Come on.
MOVE IT!
Jeffrey swings hard around another corner and heads up a dark street, passing "Lincoln St."
JEFFREY I can't outrun this guy.
He floors the car and flies down another street very fast.
JEFFREY My father has a gun at home.
SANDY No.
JEFFREY Sandy.
JEFFREY this guy is a killer!!
JEFFREY I promise you.
Sandy turns back to take a look.
Jeffrey swerves the car again; he bangs it off a curb as he rounds a corner.
A hub cap goes flying off rolling noisily down the street.
SANDY Try to get to my house.
SANDY then my father can.
He remembers Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, at Sandy's house.
JEFFREY No!!
Jeffrey floors the car again.
but the car behind him is fast and gains on him.
It swerves back and forth in the rear view mirror.
Now it swerves and roars up alongside Jeffrey's car.
Sandy screams.
SANDY It's Mike!
SANDY It's Mike!
Jeffrey looks over.
It is Mike.
Out of enormous sense of relief he starts laughing.
He slows instantly and so does Mike.
He pulls slowly up in front of his house, his head back laughing.
Mike swerves his car in front of Jeffrey's and jumps out.
MIKE Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard.
MIKE I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
SANDY ...
SANDY Stop it Mike.
MIKE You shut up.
MIKE nobody's talkin' to you.
MIKE Hey who's that Jeffrey?
MIKE Your mother?
Everyone turns and looks.
Slowly out of the darkness comes a nude woman.
It is Dorothy.
She is totally in shock, bloody saliva is dripping from her mouth.
She is bloody, swollen and bruised all over.
She is totally different, drained of her sexuality.
She has been ravaged.
JEFFREY Dorothy!
JEFFREY ...
JEFFREY Dorothy!
SANDY Dorothy Vallens?
JEFFREY Yes.
He jumps out of the car, gets a hold of her and helps her back.
Mike comes after him.
MIKE Hey, you ivy league shit.
MIKE COME HERE!
JEFFREY Later Mike.
JEFFREY I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
SANDY Mike, go home.
Mike's friends are dazed, watching Dorothy staggering beside Jeffrey.
Mike steps back as Jeffrey puts Dorothy in the car.
Jeffrey stands back up and glances at Mike.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Hey.
Jeffrey gets into the car.
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY okay, Mike.
Jeffrey shuts the door.
Dorothy is sandwiched between him and Sandy in the front seat.
SANDY Take her to my house.
SANDY My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone.
SANDY Do you have anything to put around her?
JEFFREY No.
JEFFREY Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
SANDY Probably not.
SANDY no.
SANDY Why?
JEFFREY OK.
JEFFREY Let's get her over to your father's.
(looking quickly from Dorothy to Jeffrey) Right.
Watch out for Mike, there.
Mike and his friends are getting in Mike's car.
Mike is trying to start the engine.
He does and clumsily throws the car in reverse.
He screeches out and screeches to a stop.
Then he guns away forward and shoots crazily down the road.
JEFFREY Here we go.
They drive off.
DOROTHY Oh God.
DOROTHY Jeffrey is that you?
Sandy looks at Jeffrey questioningly.
JEFFREY Yeah, it's me.
DOROTHY Oh God, Jeffrey.
DOROTHY is that you?
DOROTHY Oh God.
Sandy is confused.
how do they know each other?
Jeffrey and Sandy take Dorothy up the walk.
Sandy opens the door.
They enter the living room.
Mrs. Williams comes in from the kitchen.
SANDY Is Dad home?
MRS. WILLIAMS No.
SANDY You better call him and get an ambulance too.
Dorothy is clinging to Jeffrey.
Mrs. Williams goes to call.
Sandy moves closer.
Jeffrey looks at Sandy and she returns the look.
DOROTHY Where have you been?
DOROTHY Oh God.
DOROTHY they hurt him, Jeffrey.
DOROTHY Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me.
DOROTHY HOLD ME.
DOROTHY Oh God.
JEFFREY It's okay.
JEFFREY it's okay.
DOROTHY My secret lover.
Mrs. Williams comes in.
MRS. WILLIAMS The ambulance will be here in a minute.
MRS. WILLIAMS I left word for John.
MRS. WILLIAMS The police are on their way.
DOROTHY Don't get the police.
DOROTHY Oh God, ...Jeffrey
She looks up at Mrs. Williams.
DOROTHY I opened myself to him.
DOROTHY He put his disease in me.
She presses herself tight to Jeffrey.
DOROTHY Tell me its okay.
DOROTHY I opened myself to you.
DOROTHY Okay, okay, okay, okay?
Mrs. Williams watches with confusion and worry for the hurt this is causing Sandy.
Sandy is crying now and turns away.
JEFFREY Sandy?
JEFFREY ...Sandy, please.
MRS. WILLIAMS I'll get a coat for her.
She leaves the room hurriedly.
SANDY Jeffrey?
SANDY .What's going on?
JEFFREY Shh.
JEFFREY I'll tell you.
DOROTHY They hurt his head.
JEFFREY Who, Dorothy?
DOROTHY Don.
DOROTHY help him.
DOROTHY HELP HIM!!
DOROTHY DONNY!!!!
A huge, roaring wind sound comes up.
Dorothy starts screaming.
The SCREAMS DISSOLVE INTO a SIREN as it roars to a stop in front of the Williams' house.
Dorothy clings to Jeffrey.
Her eyes are turning a dull, milky white.
The effect is horrifying.
She is in shock.
Sandy is still crying, while she moves back and watches Jeffrey.
Jeffrey turns to look at Sandy.
SANDY I still love you Jeffrey.
Mrs. Williams comes to put a coat around Dorothy.
Mrs. Williams is shaking.
The Paramedics enter the house.
The PARAMEDICS are loading Dorothy into the ambulance on a stretcher.
Dorothy is moaning.
A sickening, warm wind comes up and howls through the neighborhood.
JEFFREY I should go with her, Sandy.
SANDY Go ahead.
JEFFREY ...
JEFFREY Sandy?.
SANDY Go ahead!
Jeffrey turns slowly and gets into the ambulance.
Jeffrey's head is very close to Dorothy's.
Dorothy is saying something, mumbling.
DOROTHY Hold me, Don.
JEFFREY Don?.
JEFFREY Where is he?
DOROTHY (straining her eyes to
focus on Jeffrey) HELP HIM!!
Promise me you'll help him!
JEFFREY I promise, Dorothy.
JEFFREY I promise.
DOROTHY Hold me.
DOROTHY I'M FALLING!
She bolts up screaming directly into Jeffrey's face.
Her beaten face and milky eyes are a study in horror.
Jeffrey finishes dialing.
JEFFREY Mrs. Williams?.
JEFFREY Is Sandy there?
JEFFREY Please.
JEFFREY Sandy?
JEFFREY (pause) Sandy, please.
JEFFREY forgive me.
JEFFREY I love you.
Sandy with red eyes in a darkened room.
SANDY I forgive you.
SANDY I just couldn't watch.
SANDY I love you Jeffrey.
SANDY I love you.
SANDY Is she okay?.
SANDY How horrible.
SANDY What?
Jeffrey on pay phone.
JEFFREY Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away.
JEFFREY Be sure your father comes.
JEFFREY Something is happening over there.
JEFFREY They're hurting someone.
JEFFREY the guy she loves.
JEFFREY Tell them to hurry.
JEFFREY I'm going over right now.
SANDY (V.O.) No Jeffrey!!
JEFFREY Yes I'm going.
JEFFREY I have to.
JEFFREY I love you.
JEFFREY I will, believe me.
Driving through the night.
Jeffrey arrives at Dorothy's apartment building and pays the driver.
He gets out of the cab and looks around.
No police.
Quiet.
The building looks just the same standing there in the dark.
The dim lights in the front entrance.
Jeffrey moves up to the front doors and enters.
No one.
Sandy is trying to get her father on the police radio.
SANDY No.
SANDY he only wants my father to come over.
SANDY It's very important.
SANDY he said someone was hurt and he wants Detective Williams there.
SANDY well, find him!!
Jeffrey slowly climbs the stairs.
His shoes squashing the carpet make mall crushing sounds as he climbs higher into the building.
He arrives at the Seventh Floor and stops.
A high-pitched whine can be heard faintly.
It gets louder as Jeffrey crosses to Dorothy's apartment door.
He gets his key out and inserts it.
Turns it.
With a loud click the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing.
He sees something and jumps back.
It is Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, standing in the center of the room.
He plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again.
Something is wrong with him.
He is bleeding from the head.
He stands almost motionless.
in shock.
Jeffrey peers into the room again.
He enters carefully and lets the door close behind him.
He very cautiously moves forward into the room.
Slowly he moves closer to a hideous sight.
Standing in the middle of Dorothy's apartment is T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.
He is in an extreme state of shock.
He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head.
His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see.
Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears.
only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his head.
A bullet hole in the center of his forehead.
The T.V. is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine.
Jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall.
The high whine stops instantly.
Silence except for the Yellow Man's labored breathing.
Suddenly there is a loud "radio voice" coming from the Yellow Man's police radio which is turned "on" in his jacket pocket.
Jeffrey's heart leaps and just as suddenly the Yellow Man throws his arms out wildly knocking a floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light.
Jeffrey's heart goes wild at this sight and he jumps back but the Yellow Man is silent and motionless again.
The radio talks again.
RADIO VOICE #1 Get back and stay down.
RADIO VOICE #2 It's apartment eight.
Music.
LOVE LETTERS STRAIGHT FROM MY HEART.
begins to play.
Jeffrey watches the Yellow Man and listens to the radio.
RADIO VOICE #2 I'm sending Jack and Pete to the roof.
RADIO VOICE #2 It's.
RADIO VOICE #1 Hey.
Sounds of shots.
RADIO VOICE #1 He's shooting.
RADIO VOICE #1 from the second window.
RADIO VOICE #3 Stay in place.
RADIO VOICE #2 Jack.
RADIO VOICE #2 get up there quick.
RADIO VOICE #2 can return fire?.
RADIO VOICE #3 I think he's alone.
RADIO VOICE #3 but return fire to second window only.
Many shots.
We see Jeffrey's face in CLOSEUP.
The real scene is before us.
Police cars line the street along with a huge fire truck and several ambulances.
Special police marksmen are crouched behind cars and behind a stone wall opposite Frank's building.
Screams are heard from within and police radios blare.
Shots are being fired into a black window.
Once in a while a shot is returned.
Two policeman are dead and one is being loaded onto an ambulance.
POLICEMAN #1 He hasn't fired a shot for six minutes.
POLICEMAN #1 maybe we got him.
POLICEMAN #1 get on the radio.
POLICEMAN #1 get Detective Williams.
POLICEMAN #1 ask him if we can rush the son of a bitch.
A policeman runs off.
more shots are fired into the building but none are returned.
The policeman comes running back.
POLICEMAN #2 It's in the works already.
POLICEMAN #2 we're in there.
POLICEMAN #2 they're goin' down the back stairs now.
POLICEMAN #2 It won't be long.
POLICEMAN #2 and they'll have us rush 'em from here.
POLICEMAN #2 one whistle and we go.
Suddenly there is a long barrage of gunfire into Frank's apartment.
Then a loud whistle.
POLICEMAN #1 That's it.
POLICEMAN #1 let's go.
Police race across the street to Frank's building.
Police kick the door in and rush into the apartment.
It's empty excpt for a large dog which has been shot.
The dog growls and cowers back in a corner.
Every now and then it limps on bloody legs back and forth.
Jeffrey hears the radio.
He hears the policemen talking at Frank's place.
He hears that Frank is gone.
He decides to leave Dorothy's apartment.
JEFFREY I'm leaving now.
JEFFREY I'll let them find you all on their own.
JEFFREY find all this horror on their own.
JEFFREY Good bye.
He goes out and closes the door.
The door clicks shut.
He makes his way quietly down the hall to the stairway.
thinking.
He starts down the stairs.
JEFFREY So.
JEFFREY Frank escaped.
He rounds the corner on a landing on the stairway and goes down another floor.
and another.
At the next landing, something out the window catches his eye.
He notices a man get out of the car.
He recognizes the man.
It is the well-dressed man he saw with the alligator briefcase.
Jeffrey watches the man come toward Dorothy's building.
Then his eye goes back to the man's car.
It is Frank's car.
He notices the man is carrying a police radio.
JEFFREY Frank's car.
JEFFREY Is this man a cop?
JEFFREY He has a radio!.
JEFFREY So did Frank though and he's no cop.
JEFFREY that's for sure.
JEFFREY and he's driving Frank's car.
JEFFREY who is he?
The man enters the building at the front entrance directly below Jeffrey.
Jeffrey starts climbing back up the stairs.
thinking faster.
JEFFREY What happened that day?.
Jeffrey remembers Frank and the Yellow Man go into Frank's building.
JEFFREY (V.O.) They went in together.
Jeffrey remembers the well-dressed man come out with the Yellow Man.
JEFFREY and out came.
JEFFREY No it couldn't be.
JEFFREY But I think it is!!
JEFFREY It's Frank!!
Jeffrey runs like mad up to Dorothy's apartment.
He looks back once and sees the well-dressed man hurrying up the stairs.
CLOSEUP on well-dressed man's face.
It is Frank, underneath a very good disguise.
Jeffrey has trouble getting the key out of his pocket.
He fumbles with it and it drops to the floor.
Frank climbs the stairs.
Finally the key goes in and Jeffrey frantically opens the door.
He rushes into the room.
The horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again.
He rushes to the Yellow Man and takes the police radio out of his pocket.
He runs into the back of the apartment - to the back bedroom where he crouches down behind a double bed.
JEFFREY Detective Williams!!
JEFFREY Detective Williams!!
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Detective Williams here.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Is that you, Jeffrey?
JEFFREY Yes it's me!!!
JEFFREY Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.
JEFFREY Oh no.
JEFFREY Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!
JEFFREY Detective Williams.
JEFFREY hurry.
JEFFREY I'm in the apartment.
JEFFREY hurry.
JEFFREY I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Sandy runs frantically down a dark street.
We see a street sign which says "Lincoln."
Jeffrey drops the radio under the bed and runs back to the living room.
He leaps safely into the closet just as Frank opens the apartment door and enters.
Jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet.
Frank is smiling.
FRANK (calling pleasantly in the direction
of the back bedroom) Hey neighbor.
shit for brains.
You forgot I have a police radio.
I know where your cute little butt is hiding.
Here I come!
Ready or not!
He starts down the hall to the back bedroom.
The police radio which Jeffrey planted under the bed and Frank's radio both start broadcasting.
Frank turns his radio off - now only the one under the bed plays.
FRANK Hey fuck.
FRANK I can hear you radio!
FRANK .Hey you stupid fuck.
FRANK you got about a second to live.
Jeffrey watches Frank reach inside his coat for his gun.
He watches Frank sneak to the back bedroom area.
Jeffrey turns and looks at the Yellow Man.
He gets an idea.
He quickly rushes out of the closet - feels inside the Yellow Man's coat for his police gun.
It's there.
He gets it but it causes the Yellow Man to moan and leap some in another almost death-spasm.
Jeffrey takes the bloody pistol and races back inside the closet frantically catching his breath.
Just then he hears Frank in the back room.
FRANK (V.O.) Hey pretty pretty.
Jeffrey then hears three or four shots - deadly sounding coming from a pistol with a silencer attached.
FRANK (V.O.) Hey fuck, where are you?
Jeffrey sees a furious Frank come storming out of the back room and come slowly up the hall - directly toward him.
Jeffrey raises his pistol - very slowly.
Frank enters the living room.
He looks around.
The Yellow Man moans.
Frank makes a face and blasts the remainder of the Yellow Man's head away and this time the Yellow Man falls dead to the floor.
Jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air.
Frank looks to the kitchen.
all around the living room.
He looks at the closet.
He smiles - he slowly goes right toward Jeffrey - smiling.
Jeffrey points the pistol.
His finger moves to the trigger.
He squints his eyes.
He doesn't want to kill a man.
any man.
Frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open, when Jeffrey hears Sandy scream.
SANDY (V.O.) Jeffrey!!
Frank and Jeffrey lock eyes as Jeffrey pulls the trigger.
He yells Sandy's name and Frank's head is blown off.
We see Sandy's frightened face.
We see policemen racing up the stairs in Dorothy's apartment.
We see cop cars with lights revolving, radios blaring.
The large room is crowded with policemen and members of the F.B.I.
Everyone is talking excitedly.
Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting by Detective Williams in wooden chairs near the center of the room.
We hear bits of conversation.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
JEFFREY Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Not yet.
JEFFREY Oh my God.
JEFFREY Is her son OK?
F.B.I. MAN We're looking for him.
F.B.I. MAN In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
JEFFREY He became obsessed with her.
JEFFREY She hated him.
JEFFREY He had to have her.
JEFFREY He kidnapped them to control her.
JEFFREY to make her do things.
JEFFREY Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive.
JEFFREY I'm not kidding.
JEFFREY Frank loved blue.
JEFFREY blue velvet.
JEFFREY He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
F.B.I. MAN You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY I guess I did.
JEFFREY (He turns to Sandy
with a worried look) What's going to happen to me?
F.B.I. MAN We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams.
F.B.I. MAN I'll tell you though.
F.B.I. MAN you're okay.
F.B.I. MAN you shot a real son of a bitch.
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY I sure know that.
JEFFREY Yeah, but how many more are out there?
A huge low roaring sound comes in.
SLOWLY WE COME UP OUT OF A HUGE DARK HOLE.
We see we are rising out of an ear but still among the crevices.
They look enormous.
We move up and float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye.
Jeffrey's eye.
His face is bathed in light.
All sorts of springtime-in-the-garden sounds are heard.
We suddenly see that Jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard.
Detective Williams is with Mr. Beaumont working in the garden in the distance.
The sprinkler is turning.
Sandy comes out on the back porch and calls.
SANDY Jeffrey.
SANDY Lunch is ready.
Jeffrey opens his eyes.
He looks around confused for a moment.
He sees Sandy.
JEFFREY Okay.
JEFFREY I'll be right in.
Sandy goes back inside.
Suddenly, a big red ROBIN chirps loudly above.
Jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree.
The Robin and Jeffrey seems to exchange a special look.
Jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird.
He gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of the house.
As he passes his father and Detective Williams:
JEFFREY How ya doin' Dad?
MR. BEAUMONT Hey Jeff.
MR. BEAUMONT I'm feelin' so much better.
JEFFREY Good deal Dad.
He and Detective Williams share a smile.
Jeffrey enters the kitchen and sees Sandy standing with Aunt Barbara by the kitchen window.
Beyond, in the living room Mrs. Williams and Jeffrey's mother turn toward the kitchen when they hear the screen door slam.
A large Red Robin has just flown down to the window still carrying a big bug in its mouth.
SANDY Look Jeffrey.
JEFFREY Yeah.
JEFFREY I just saw him outside.
JEFFREY Maybe the robins are here.
AUNT BARBARA I don't see how they do it.
AUNT BARBARA I could never eat a bug.
JEFFREY AND SANDY It's a strange world, isn't it?
Yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze.
A bright red gorgeous fire engine is moving very slowly down the street.
We MOVE IN to see the happy face of a FIREMAN.
A very clean uniformed, smiling POLICEMAN with arms outstretched allows clean happy SCHOOL CHILDREN to cross the street safely.
A songbird SINGS in a tree.
We are in a beautiful park.
Slowly we move down and a little hat with a propeller comes into view.
The hat is on the head of a small child who is dancing slowly toward Dorothy.
She is laughing.
When the boy gets within arms reach they embrace.
We move close to Dorothy's smiling face.
Tears of happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we hear Bobby Vinton sing the last lines of his song.
"and I still can see Blue Velvet through my tears."
Blue Velvet dissolves in and takes over the image.
