HORRIBLE BOSSES
Written by

April 14, 2010
Looking incredibly weary, NICK WATERS, 30's, enters his apartment in his business suit.
He stumbles into --
He drops his briefcase, strips off his jacket, loosens his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man.
PAN OVER TO the alarm clock which reads "1:23 AM."
The alarm clock now reads "4:59 AM."
It switches to "5:00" and a BLARING BUZZER goes off.
Nick sits up in bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself out of bed.
He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the saddest, deadest houseplant in history.
Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy leftover containers and crusty condiments.
The orange juice container he grabs is empty.
NICK Damn.
NICK The frame reads: "I Y Grandma!" Nick sighs sadly.
Nick sits on the toilet eating his breakfast bowl with a fork.
He takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes his mouth with it.
Nick showers while simultaneously brushing his teeth and shaving.
He loses track and brushes his face with the toothbrush.
Nick hastily grabs work clothes from his messy drawers and closet.
Clearly, no laundry has been done in a while.
Nick hurriedly buttons his shirt, tucks it in and begins tying his tie as the elevator reaches the lobby.
As he drives to work, he dials a number and transfers it to speakerphone.
Hello?
Hey, Jenna, it's Nick.
JENNA (V.O.) It's five-thirty in the morning, Nick.
NICK Yeah, sorry.
NICK This is like the only time I have to make any personal calls.
NICK I just wanted to see if you felt like going out again because I had a great time with you on our last date.
JENNA (V.O.) Our last date was two weeks ago.
JENNA (V.O.) You haven't called me since.
NICK I know and that's my bad.
NICK I've been swamped at work --
JENNA (V.O.) Yeah, I remember.
JENNA (V.O.) Work was all you talked about when we went out.
NICK Right.
NICK Well, I'm up for a promotion which will give me a lot more free time --
JENNA (V.O.) Listen, I'm actually seeing someone.
JENNA (V.O.) And even if I weren't, the last thing I need is some career-obsessed guy complaining about work all the time.
JENNA (V.O.) See you around, Nick.
A soulless four-story building in a drab office park.
Nick exits his car and runs full-speed to the entrance.
Nick bursts through the doors and looks at his watch.
It reads "6:02."
He looks up at a security camera with a flashing red light, indicating he is on tape.
NICK Fuck!
Nick sits at his desk inputting information from a large PILE of documents into a spreadsheet on his computer.
The clock on his computer turns to "8:00 AM."
HARKEN Nick.
Nick jumps, startled.
He turns to see his boss, DAVE HARKEN, 40's, standing behind him.
NICK Yes?
HARKEN See you in my office?
of the lobby security camera footage on a television.
The time code at the bottom of the screen reads "6:02."
We see Nick looking up at the camera and silently mouthing the word "Fuck!" The image freezes and we PULL BACK to see Harken holding the remote.
Nick stands across from him.
HARKEN Here's my concern, Nick.
HARKEN You're a punctual guy.
HARKEN You understand the importance of getting to work on time.
HARKEN So that leaves me to wonder if there isn't something wrong with the internal clock in our security system.
HARKEN What do you think?
NICK I don't know, Mr. Harken.
NICK I might have been a minute late.
HARKEN Two minutes according to this.
HARKEN So either you're a liar -- which I know you're not -- or our system is off by a full minute.
HARKEN And if that's the case, I have no choice but to dismiss Thomas, our longtime security coordinator.
NICK Okay, I might have been two minutes late.
There's an uncomfortable beat.
Then --
HARKEN So you did lie.
NICK No, I --
Harken picks up the phone.
NICK Who are you calling?
HARKEN Thomas.
HARKEN I'm letting him go.
NICK Wait!
NICK Okay, I guess I lied.
NICK But I didn't mean to --
HARKEN Trust is everything in this office, my friend.
HARKEN I know you've been working your tail off for that promotion, but if I can't trust you, how can I make you Senior VP of Sales?
NICK I understand.
NICK You can trust me.
HARKEN Now you sound like my wife.
14 INSERT - PHOTO 14 of the hot, bikini-clad MRS.
HARKEN, 30's, standing on a beach.
`Trust me, honey.' `Trust me.' Meanwhile, she's making love to every guy in the neighborhood.
Oh, I'm sure she's...
loyal to
HARKEN How could you possibly know that?
NICK I don't.
HARKEN Are you making love to my wife, Nick?
NICK What?!
NICK No!
HARKEN I'm just kidding around.
HARKEN She's out of your league.
HARKEN No offense.
NICK None taken.
HARKEN Hmm.
Harken has crossed to a credenza with several bottles of booze, two glasses and an ice bucket.
He begins to fill a glass with ice and Scotch.
HARKEN Would you like one?
NICK It's 8:15.
HARKEN You think there's something wrong with a man enjoying a drink in the morning?
No, no.
It's fine.
I'd love a drink.
Harken hands him the drink he just poured.
NICK Thank you.
HARKEN My pleasure.
Harken returns to his chair and sits.
NICK Aren't you having one?
HARKEN It's 8:15, Nick.
HARKEN I'm not an alcoholic.
NICK Oh.
NICK Well, I only took it because I thought you were having one.
HARKEN You took a drink because you thought I was going to have one?
That doesn't exactly sound like something a Senior VP would do.
NICK Well, I --
HARKEN What if you thought I was going to dip my balls in honey and shaved coconut?
HARKEN Would you do that too?
Of course not.
HARKEN Of course not.
HARKEN Anyway, we've moved up the date of the AGM so you're gonna need to complete your due diligence by Monday.
HARKEN You'll probably need to be here all weekend.
Okay.
HARKEN Hey, you want a promotion, you've gotta earn it.
HARKEN Life's a marathon and you can't win a marathon without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples.
NICK Got it.
Nick gets up to go.
HARKEN Nick.
Nick turns back.
HARKEN That's 18-year-old Scotch.
HARKEN I can't really pour it back into the bottle.
HARKEN That should carry you till lunch, huh?
A car pulls up outside the modest building.
STACY, cute, 30's, is dropping off DALE STEVENS, 30's, who wears the scrubs of a dental hygienist.
STACY Boy, I have to get used to driving with this heavy ring on.
STACY I keep swerving to the left.
DALE Aww.
DALE You really like it?
STACY I love it.
STACY I feel like a queen.
It's tiny and yellowish.
DALE Well, you're my queen.
DALE I love you, Stacy.
STACY Have a great day at work.
Stacy drives off.
Dale steels himself for what lies ahead, then goes inside.
Dale enters the waiting room, passing a few PATIENTS.
He grabs a mask and goggles from a supply room, then heads
Dale finds his boss, DR.
JULIA HARRIS, 30's, sexy but with something a little off, hovering over a patient, MR.
ANDERTON, 50's.
Dale seems visibly uneasy.
JULIA All right, Mr. Anderton, I'm going to give you the nitrous now and your root canal will be over before you know it.
Dale?
Please.
Dale turns the valve on the tank and soon Mr. Anderton's eyes roll back in his head.
Julia shuts the door, picks up a drill and begins boring into the patient's molar.
JULIA (loudly, over the
How are you today, Dale?
DALE I'm fine.
DALE Thanks.
JULIA You get a haircut?
DALE Uh-huh.
JULIA Looks good.
DALE Thank you.
JULIA You ever watch that show, `Gossip Girl'?
DALE Uh, no.
JULIA I watched it last night.
JULIA I'll tell you, lot of cuties on that program.
Number 7 scraper, please.
Dale hands her a tool.
JULIA Thank you.
JULIA I fingered myself so hard to Penn Badgely, I broke a nail.
Dale sighs and looks down at the unconscious Mr.
Anderton.
This obviously isn't the first time Julia has spoken this way.
JULIA I'd let that kid put it in my ass.
JULIA Bet he's packing a plus-size sausage under those True Religions.
JULIA (then, looking up at
Probe.
DALE What?
JULIA I need the probe.
DALE Oh, right.
He hands her the tool.
JULIA Bet you're no shrimp in the cock department either, huh, Dale?
DALE Julia, please.
JULIA Oh, come on.
JULIA You know I like to fool around.
She lifts the patient's limp hand and cups it over her breast.
Mr. Anderton!
Bad!
She smacks the lifeless hand and cackles with laughter.
JULIA Okay, enough fun.
JULIA Let's get back to work.
JULIA Water, please.
Dale hands her the Water Jet tool.
Julia briefly sprays some water in the patient's mouth, then casually sprays down Dale's crotch with it.
DALE Hey!
JULIA Sorry, I'm a squirter.
JULIA I think I can just make out our friend.
JULIA Looks like someone is circumcised!
DALE All right, Julia, listen.
DALE You can't keep doing this.
JULIA I know, I know, you have a
DALE She's not my girlfriend anymore.
DALE Stacy and I got engaged last night.
Julia's whole demeanor changes.
She becomes deadly serious.
JULIA What?
DALE We're engaged.
JULIA You're actually going to marry that little dummy?
DALE Hey!
JULIA I thought you said she was just a hole for your dick.
DALE That's a horrible thing to say.
DALE I never said that!
I'm very disappointed in you, Dale.
Scaler.
Shaken, Dale hands her the tool.
A medium-sized warehouse building in an industrial neighborhood.
KURT GAMBLE, 30s, good-looking, sits at his desk.
Unlike Nick and Dale, Kurt seems content in his workplace.
A reasonably cute, but by no means drop-dead gorgeous, UPS GIRL approaches his desk with a package.
UPS GIRL Excuse me?
UPS GIRL Can you sign for this, please?
Sure.
Whoa, whoa.
Hold on.
What is this?
UPS GIRL I'm sorry?
KURT This is one of those hidden camera shows, isn't it?
UPS GIRL What do you mean?
KURT Come on.
KURT You're way too good- looking to be a UPS girl.
KURT What are you, a model?
KURT An actress?
KURT What's gonna happen when I open this box?
KURT Is something going to jump out at me?
Nothing's gonna happen.
I'm just a UPS girl.
KURT Shut up.
You shut up.
It's true.
KURT Well, then, I need to take you out to dinner.
UPS GIRL Why?
KURT Because I want to be able to tell my friends that I took out the hottest UPS girl in America.
KURT Come on, what do you say?
She considers this briefly, then scribbles her number on a Post-it note.
KURT Awesome.
KURT I'm Kurt.
UPS GIRL Myrna.
KURT Pretty name.
KURT How's Tuesday?
KURT Macaroni Grill?
UPS GIRL Okay.
KURT See you then, Myrna.
She heads off.
Kurt opens his DATEBOOK and scribbles "UPS Girl" in the Tuesday slot.
We see every night of
the week is filled with appointments with other women: "Barnes & Noble girl," "Lauren?
Laura?," "Blonde Chick" and so on.
JACK Busy week?
KURT Hey, Jack.
KURT Yeah, just doing my part for the women of America.
You're what we used to call a rapscallion.
KURT That sounds a lot more innocent than `sex addict.'
JACK Walk with me, Kurt.
The two of them head toward the exit.
JACK I wanted to talk to you about --
KURT Last quarter's profits?
KURT I ran the numbers.
KURT We're down by 11 percent year-to-year.
JACK It's this damn recession.
JACK What about cost-cutting measures?
KURT Well, I know you don't want to cut
JACK No way.
JACK These people have worked their asses off for me.
JACK There's no reason they should suffer.
Kurt looks at his boss with admiration.
There's a lot of love between these two.
KURT There's also the issue of our hazardous waste disposal.
KURT We're paying a lot right now and the Bolivians have come back with a very good offer.
JACK You know why it's good?
JACK Because they'll dump our chemicals in rivers, pollute water supplies and hurt people.
JACK I've spent my life building this company.
Would you want the Pellit name to be associated with something like that?
KURT No, I wouldn't.
As they pass the unisex rest room, they see MARGIE, 30s and clearly pregnant, looking uncomfortable as she waits to get in.
JACK Everything okay, Margie?
MARGIE Oh hi, Mr. Pellit.
MARGIE Kurt.
MARGIE I've just been waiting to get in there for a while now...
JACK Who's in there?
MARGIE It's...
MARGIE your son.
Of course it is.
(then, knocking on
Bobby?
There's someone waiting.
You almost done in there?
After a long beat, the door opens and out steps BOBBY PELLIT, late-20s, weasely-looking, sniffing a bit too much and rubbing his nose repeatedly.
There's something unnaturally energetic about him.
PELLIT What the fuck?!
PELLIT A guy can't get any privacy in this place!
JACK It's all yours, Margie.
Margie quickly slips into the rest room and shuts the door.
JACK You know, Bobby, you seem to be spending more time in that bathroom than at your desk these days.
PELLIT Well, then, you're fucking stupid, Dad.
PELLIT Because that's clearly not true.
JACK All I ask is that you do your part around here, son.
PELLIT I do my part.
PELLIT I do other people's parts.
PELLIT But you just like to ride my ass because I'm your son.
PELLIT I don't see you screaming at --
-- dickskin here.
That's because Kurt does his work and does it well.
You could take a lesson from him.
The only thing I'd take a lesson from him on is being gay.
And I wouldn't take that lesson because I don't want to be gay.
Come on, Kurt.
Kurt follows after Jack.
PELLIT Yeah, that's what I thought.
Jack and Kurt pass a receptionist desk and go out into --
Kurt walks Jack to his Cadillac.
JACK Tell me something, Kurt.
JACK Are you happy here?
KURT You kidding?
KURT It's the best job in the world.
JACK I'm glad to hear you say that.
JACK I'm rewriting my will tonight and there's going to be a special place for you in there.
JACK A bewildered Kurt runs toward the car, as we --
Kurt sits at a table looking depressed.
KURT He died instantly.
KURT They say his heart burst in his chest like a water balloon.
PAN to reveal Kurt is sitting with Dale, who looks just as dejected.
DALE Wow.
DALE Sorry, man.
DALE He was like a dad to you.
KURT I loved him.
KURT And I loved working for him.
KURT And now his idiot son is gonna be in charge.
KURT You know how many times I've caught him doing blow at work?
PAN FURTHER to reveal Nick sitting beside Dale.
NICK That sucks.
NICK You were the only one of us who didn't totally hate his job.
Did I tell you Harken tricked me into having a drink at eight o'clock this morning?
The guy's the devil.
DALE I thought he was giving you a promotion.
NICK He is.
NICK And he's got to do it before the General Meeting next week.
DALE Well, at least your boss doesn't sexually harass you.
KURT This again?
DALE I'm telling you, she's out of control.
DALE It's a full-on hostile work environment.
KURT She's a woman who wants to have sex with you.
KURT How bad can it be?
DALE Today she sprayed my crotch with water so she could see the outline of my wiener.
KURT Why don't you just fuck her?
DALE I'm engaged!
KURT Oh yeah.
KURT Congratulations, by the way.
DALE Thank you.
NICK There's gotta be other dental hygienist jobs out there.
DALE I can't apply for another job, remember?
KURT Oh, right.
KURT Because you'd have to tell them you're a child molester.
NICK He's not a child molester.
NICK He just took his dick out in a playground.
DALE It was nighttime and I was peeing!
DALE And it's bullshit that I got put on the registered sex offender list for that!
KURT It worked out.
KURT Julia probably hired you because she's a sexual deviant herself.
DALE Why would they put a playground next to a bar anyway?
DALE That's entrapment.
A SEMI-CUTE GIRL walks past.
Well, I should go see if that girl wants to bone.
Kurt groans as he pulls himself out of the booth.
NICK I thought you were all broken up about your boss dying.
KURT This is how I grieve, okay?
Kurt heads off after the girl.
DALE Man.
DALE He must be grieving all the time.
Nick sits alongside five other CO-WORKERS at a conference table.
Harken's chair at the head is empty.
Nick pours himself some water from a glass pitcher on the table.
NICK He did say ten o'clock, right?
Yeah.
Do you know what this is about?
NICK It just said `staff meeting' on the memo.
Funny how he gets all over me if I'm a minute late, but he makes us wait fifteen.
HARKEN You were two minutes late, Nick.
Nick jumps as Harken enters.
HARKEN And I didn't know I had to punch a clock with you.
NICK You don't.
NICK Of course you don't.
NICK I'm sorry --
HARKEN I'm going to attribute this to your drinking problem.
NICK I don't have a --
HARKEN (with a smile to the
Let's get started.
Shall we?
Nick's eyes narrow.
Suddenly, he grabs the heavy glass pitcher from the table and SHATTERS IT AGAINST HARKEN'S FACE.
Shards of glass fly everywhere as Harken falls from his chair onto the floor.
Harken is fine.
Nick is as we left him.
HARKEN Okay, have we figured out our best sales distribution plan for the new model year handsets?
Nick's CO-WORKERS bury their heads in their notes.
Nick tensely raises his hand.
HARKEN Yes?
NICK I simulated a number of sales cycles, factoring in likely end- users, point-of-sale limitations and specific demographic variables.
HARKEN And?
NICK And in my opinion, an open plan selling process in our top 30 markets along with targeted upgrade offers to existing customers promises the greatest yield.
Harken nods.
Is he impressed?
HARKEN Thank you, Nick.
HARKEN Did everyone see how he did that?
HARKEN Yes, he may be a pathological liar and have a crippling drinking problem, but when the chips are down, Nick has what it takes.
Nick glows.
HARKEN Which brings us to our next order of business.
HARKEN I've decided who I want as our new Senior VP of Sales.
HARKEN He's sitting right here among you.
Everyone turns to look at Nick.
HARKEN It's me.
Everyone's head snaps back to Harken.
NICK What?
HARKEN I've decided to absorb the responsibilities of the Senior VP position into my own.
HARKEN I realized if you want something done right, you do it yourself.
HARKEN So, I'm going to be knocking down the wall between my office and what would've been the Senior VP's to create a single, enormous office.
HARKEN However, as a cost-cutting measure, I will only be taking 85% of the additional salary I'm entitled to.
HARKEN It's called self- sacrifice, people.
HARKEN Learn from this.
Nick hurries to catch up with Harken.
NICK Mr. Harken, can I speak to you?
HARKEN What is it?
NICK You've been hinting for months that I was in line for that promotion.
HARKEN And look how hard you've worked.
NICK So you've just been lying to me?
HARKEN Not lying.
HARKEN Motivating.
HARKEN We're all on the same team here, Nick.
HARKEN We're all trying to find Lorenzo's oil before it's too late for little Lorenzo.
HARKEN Besides, I'm the one who's taking on a lot more work.
NICK (barely keeping it
Last month you kept me working so late I didn't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam!
HARKEN What?
NICK My grandmother.
NICK I told you I needed to see her but you said I'd be fired if I left early.
NICK She died before I could get to the hospital.
She taught me how to swim --
HARKEN Oh, my God.
HARKEN I had no idea...
HARKEN that you called your grandmother Gam Gam.
I don't mean to laugh, but that's adorable.
(off Nick's outraged
LOOK) Look, Nick, I'm sorry you didn't get to say bye-bye to Gam Gam.
LOOK) I make you work late because you're an invaluable part of this operation.
LOOK) And I need you in your current position.
NICK I've been in that position for eight years now.
NICK Why would I stay here after being treated like this?!
HARKEN Because I will see to it that no one else in our industry will hire you.
NICK What?
HARKEN Anyone who interviews you will want my letter of recommendation.
HARKEN And I'm prepared to tell them that you are a dishonest, insubordinate drunk.
NICK But that's not true!
NICK You can't do this!
Harken gets directly in Nick's face, speaking softly but intensely.
HARKEN Let me make this clear, you weak, little fuck.
HARKEN I own you.
HARKEN You're my bitch.
HARKEN Don't make the mistake of thinking you have free will.
HARKEN Because I can crush you any time I like.
HARKEN (stepping back,
Settle in, friend.
You're here for the long haul.
Harken slaps him hard on the back and continues on his way, leaving a stunned Nick.
Kurt somberly heads to his desk.
He's wearing a dark suit.
PELLIT Yo, dickwall!
PELLIT What the fuck?
Kurt sees Bobby Pellit standing in the doorway of what was Jack's office.
KURT What?
PELLIT You're three hours late.
PELLIT What's the deal?
KURT I was at your father's funeral.
PELLIT Maybe that excuse would've flown when my dad was here, but I'm in charge now.
KURT That excuse wouldn't have made any sense when your dad was here.
PELLIT In my office.
PELLIT Now.
Kurt enters.
He notices that the "Jack Pellit" nameplate has been partially taped over with the name "Bobby" scribbled in magic marker.
PELLIT Sit.
Kurt sits.
Bobby quickly slips a small mirror and rolled up dollar bill into a drawer.
Kurt sees Bobby has tossed most of Jack's mementos, achievement awards and photos with luminaries in the trash.
PELLIT I've been looking over the books.
PELLIT You're the accountant.
PELLIT Tell me why this company is in the crapper.
KURT It's not in the crapper.
KURT It's a recession.
KURT But we're still profitable.
PELLIT Bullshit.
PELLIT Look, I know you and my dad were pals.
PELLIT Frankly, I always thought it was weird and gay and I never understood why my dad thought you were so great.
PELLIT But it doesn't matter now because he's in the ground and I'm your boss.
PELLIT And there's gonna be some changes around here.
PELLIT First of all...
PELLIT (pointing to a
What is this `EnviroTech Waste Management' shit that we're paying so much for?
KURT Your father made the decision to pay a little more to dispose of our chemical waste responsibly.
PELLIT Yeah, fuck that.
PELLIT We've got an offer from Bolivia to dump the stuff for a third the cost.
KURT But that would endanger thousands of local residents.
PELLIT So some jungle tribesmen get cancer.
PELLIT Boo friggin' hoo.
KURT They're not tribesmen.
KURT It's a
Look, Bobby, your dad told me very clearly he'd die before he'd save money by hurting people.
PELLIT Well then, we're right on schedule, aren't we?
Kurt's eyes narrow.
He reaches into the trash can and grabs one of Jack's discarded ACHIEVEMENT TROPHIES and PLUNGES its pointy end deep into Pellit's chest, impaling him in his chair.
Kurt sits across from an unharmed Pellit.
PELLIT Oh, and we also need to trim the fat around here.
KURT What do you mean?
PELLIT I want you to fire the fat people.
PELLIT They're slow and lazy and they make me sad to look at.
PELLIT Start with Large Marge.
ANGLE ON Margie at her desk.
KURT Margie's not fat.
KURT She's pregnant.
KURT I'm not firing her.
PELLIT Fine.
PELLIT Then fire Professor Xavier over there.
KURT Hank?
PELLIT He creeps me out.
PELLIT Rolling around in that weird little chair of his.
KURT I'm not firing anyone!
KURT It's like you don't care about this company at all.
PELLIT No shit.
PELLIT You think when I was a kid I dreamed of running a fucking chemical company?
PELLIT No.
PELLIT I dreamed of retiring.
PELLIT Of being fed tropical fruit on a beach by a model while she blows me.
PELLIT And as soon as I squeeze all the profit out of this place, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
PELLIT So here's the deal.
PELLIT You either fire the fatty or the cripple, or I fire both of them.
Kurt sighs as he looks from Margie to Hank and back.
At last, he gathers his resolve and crosses to Hank's desk.
From a RESPECTFUL DISTANCE we watch as Kurt breaks the news to Hank who reacts with sad resignation.
Kurt turns to see Pellit standing directly beside him.
PELLIT Everyone, can I have your attention please?
PELLIT I've just learned that Kurt has fired our dear friend Hank here.
PELLIT I want you to know that I am as surprised and angry about this as you are.
KURT What are you -- ?!
PELLIT This is entirely an accounting department decision.
PELLIT My hands are tied.
PELLIT You are one heartless bastard, Gamble.
Pellit heads off.
Hank glares at Kurt.
KURT Look, Hank, this was not my --
Fuck you, Kurt.
Hank wheels away, leaving Kurt to face the angry looks of his CO-WORKERS.
Dale, dressed for work, knocks on Julia's office door.
JULIA Come in.
Dale enters.
DALE You wanted to see --
He looks up to find Julia sitting at her desk in nothing but an unbuttoned white lab coat.
Oh, God.
JULIA Have a seat, Dale.
DALE Do I have to?
JULIA Please.
He sits, then immediately stands again.
DALE Look, Julia, this is ridiculous --
JULIA I know what you're going to say and that's exactly what I want to talk to you about.
Yes, I like to joke around at work.
And sometimes I might cross the line a bit.
But the last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable.
That's unprofessional and I pride myself on being a professional.
She leans back in her chair and puts her hands behind her head revealing even more of her body.
JULIA So from now on, I want you to tell me when and if I cross the line.
DALE Now.
DALE Right now.
JULIA What?
DALE You're naked, Julia!
JULIA I'm not naked.
JULIA You can't even see my pussy.
DALE Okay, right there!
DALE Just saying `pussy' to me.
DALE That's over the line.
JULIA That's over the line?
JULIA You're starting to sound like a little faggot, Dale.
DALE Again!
DALE Naked, `pussy,' `faggot.' All over the line.
DALE And probably
JULIA Okay, let's not start talking about illegal, Mr. Pees-on-Young- Boys.
DALE It was an empty playground!
DALE In the middle of the night!
JULIA Even worse.
JULIA That little boy must have been terrified.
Julia stands and moves uncomfortably close to Dale.
He tries not to stare at her breasts.
JULIA Let's cut to the chase.
JULIA You're engaged now.
JULIA And I respect the institution of marriage too much to violate it.
JULIA That's why you need to fuck me well before the wedding.
JULIA Because the closer it gets, the less ladylike I'm going to feel about this whole thing.
DALE I'm not going to sleep with you, Julia.
JULIA We'll see about that.
JULIA (then, suddenly
OUT! GET OUT! Startled, Dale hurries out of the office.
Nick, Dale and Kurt sit miserably over their drinks.
They've all had a few.
NICK I feel like a total sucker.
NICK Harken was never planning on promoting me.
KURT That coked-out douchebag is gonna destroy Pellit Chemicals.
DALE She stood there with her breasts right in my face.
Nick and Kurt turn to Dale.
KURT You know, yours just doesn't sound that bad.
DALE Why don't you guys quit?
DALE It's not like you're sex offenders.
NICK It's true.
NICK I mean, I'm young.
NICK I could go back to school, change fields.
In the b.g., a GUY has noticed them.
He heads over.
KURT Yeah.
KURT Why should I care about protecting Pellit's name when his own son doesn't?
KURT There's a million jobs out there.
DALE The world is your oyster.
Well, well, if it isn't the Three Musketeers, Nick, Kurt and Dale.
Still hanging out like high school, huh?
NICK I don't believe it.
NICK Kenny Orkin!
DALE I heard you moved to New York to work at Lehman Brothers or something.
I did.
Hired me right out of Yale.
KURT So what are you doing back here?
KENNY Don't you read the papers?
KENNY They shut us down.
KENNY I've been looking for work for the last two years.
KENNY It's crazy out here.
KENNY I can't even get a job waiting tables.
NICK You?
NICK Waiting tables?
NICK You were voted Most Likely to Succeed.
NICK Everyone thought you were set.
KENNY Everyone including me.
I'd murder those Lehman Brothers if I could.
Line them up, put one bullet through their three heads.
DALE Easy, Kenny.
KENNY It's just not fair.
KENNY I was making high six-figures.
KENNY Now I can't even afford this drink.
KENNY Seriously, you think you guys can help me out at all?
The three guys exchange uncomfortable looks as they reach for their wallets.
DALE Uh, sure.
DALE Here's a few bucks, Kenny.
KENNY Okay, y'know that's not really gonna do it for me.
KENNY (looking around,
I'll tell you what?
What if I give you guys handjobs?
Forty bucks.
We can do it in the bathroom right here.
I'll do the three of you for a hundred.
KURT You're gay now?
KENNY No, I'm not gay.
They look skeptical.
KENNY I'm the opposite of gay!
They guys look at each other with eyebrows raised.
Nick mouths "opposite."
KENNY Come on.
KENNY Handjobs for the Three Musketeers.
KENNY Let's do this!
The BARTENDER spots Kenny and points at him.
I thought I told you to stay out of here!
KENNY Whoops.
KENNY Gotta go, guys.
KENNY Call me if you change your minds.
KENNY I'm at my mom's.
He hurries out.
There's a silent beat as the guys process what they've just witnessed.
The three guys are walking home, all mildly buzzed.
KURT So I guess we're just gonna be miserable for the rest of our lives.
DALE What do you mean?
KURT What options do we have?
KURT We can quit our jobs and turn into Kenny.
KURT Or keep our jobs and turn into sad, ball-less losers who spend their days dreaming of ways to kill their bosses.
There's a beat as Nick regards Kurt.
NICK You do that too?
KURT Of course.
KURT Everyone does.
KURT It's the only thing that keeps us from going totally bat-shit.
NICK The other day I imagined shoving one of those jugs from the water cooler in Harken's mouth and making him drink until his bladder explodes.
DALE Jeez.
KURT That's so funny.
KURT I had the same idea for Pellit.
KURT (CONT'D) Only using gasoline instead of water.
KURT (CONT'D) And his ass instead of his mouth.
DALE You guys are sick.
KURT What's sick about it?
KURT It's just a way to let off steam.
NICK Yeah, Dale.
NICK It's not like we're actually going to kill our bosses.
They continue walking.
After a beat.
KURT You have to admit though, our lives would be a lot better if our bosses were dead.
NICK Well, of course.
NICK It's the one thing that keeps me from being happy.
DALE Me too.
There's another beat.
KURT Let's just consider this, for one second.
DALE Consider what?
KURT Killing our bosses.
KURT I'm just being hypothetical here.
DALE Yeah, right.
NICK Very funny.
KURT Well, it's not like they're gonna live forever.
KURT These pieces of shit are going to die someday.
KURT (CONT'D) We'd just be accelerating that natural process.
NICK Shut up, Kurt.
DALE Yeah, shut up, Kurt.
Frankly, I don't see any reason not to do it.
DALE Well, first of all, killing someone is illegal and immoral --
KURT It may be illegal but I'm not sure it's immoral.
KURT Sometimes one evil person has to die for the greater good of the community.
KURT If Bobby Pellit has his way, hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent Bolivians will suffer.
KURT It would actually be immoral not to kill him.
Nick begins to warm to the idea.
NICK I didn't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam because of Harken.
KURT Exactly!
KURT Who knows how many other Gam Gams have died alone.
DALE I can't believe you guys are actually talking about this.
DALE I don't care how bad our bosses are.
DALE We're not murderers.
NICK No, we're not, Dale.
NICK We're just trying to live our lives.
NICK But what are we supposed to do when someone makes it impossible for us to live our lives?
NICK Do we just bend over and take it up the ass forever?
KURT No, we do not!
DALE What you guys are talking about is wrong and you know it.
NICK Julia's ruining your life.
NICK That's wrong.
KURT Yeah!
DALE She's not ruining my life.
DALE If anything's ruining my life it's you guys and your drunk bullshit.
KURT If it's bullshit, Dale, then how come we all want to do it so much?
They reach the corner where they part ways.
DALE I don't want to do it.
DALE And when you sober up neither will you.
DALE We're not killing anyone.
Dale heads off.
I was just being hypothetical.
Yeah, me too.
OFF their ambivalent looks --
Dale is organizing some equipment when a pair of woman's hands suddenly cover his eyes.
Guess who?
I'm really not in the mood for this now --
He turns and reacts as he sees it's not Julia, but his fiancee, Stacy.
DALE Stacy?!
STACY Not in the mood for what?
DALE For...
DALE nothing.
DALE What are you doing here?
Julia appears in her office doorway.
JULIA I invited her.
STACY She called and said now that we're engaged, she wanted to offer me free dental work.
STACY And you know I've had that loose filling for a while.
STACY It's so sweet of you, Julia.
JULIA It's my pleasure.
JULIA You're part of the family now.
Uhhhh...
I don't know if this is a good idea.
STACY Why not?
DALE We don't want to take advantage of Julia.
JULIA Dale, there's nothing you could do that would be taking advantage of me.
JULIA Nothing.
JULIA Now what do you say we pump you full of gas?
Julia leads Stacy into the exam room.
Dale cuts them off.
DALE Wait -- no gas.
DALE She doesn't need to be out.
STACY What are you talking about, Dale?
STACY You know I'm not good with drills.
You don't want your fiancee to suffer, do you?
OFF Dale's defeated look --
Stacy lies on the chair with the nitrous mask over her nose.
Julia and Dale stand beside her.
Ten, nine...
eight...
seh...
And she's out.
Immediately, Julia pounces on Dale, feverishly trying to unbuckle his belt.
DALE Hey!
DALE Stop it, what are you -- ?
JULIA You're gonna give me that dong, Dale!
Stacy groans softly.
Dale pushes Julia away.
DALE I knew you only brought her in here to mess with me.
JULIA Let's have sex on top of her.
JULIA Let's use her like a bed!
Julia begins to clamber up onto Stacy's supine body.
Dale pulls her off.
DALE All right, that's it, Julia.
DALE This is over.
DALE You're out of your mind.
DALE I quit!
He goes to turn off the gas but before he can --
JULIA I'll tell her you fucked me!
DALE What?
JULIA If you don't fuck me, I'll tell her you fucked me.
DALE Tell her whatever you want.
DALE She'd never believe you.
Julia opens a nearby drawer and tosses an envelope onto Stacy's chest.
JULIA She already knows you're a sex offender.
JULIA And once she sees these, I think she'll believe me.
DALE What is that?
JULIA You remember your first week here when I replaced the crown on your second bicuspid?
...
Yeah?
JULIA I took a few snapshots of the procedure.
JULIA For my files.
Dale lunges at the envelope and pulls out the photos.
-- Dale lies on the dentist chair, his eyes open and his hands behind his head with Julia at his crotch, apparently fellating him.
-- Julia, now nude, straddles Dale, who is naked from the waist down on the chair.
She holds one arm in the air like a rodeo cowboy.
-- Julia is on the floor, her legs splayed while Dale lies limply on top of her.
-- Julia is on all fours.
Dale is limply draped over her back, apparently doing her doggy-style.
You...
you did all this while I was unconscious?
JULIA Yup.
DALE How did you make it look like I was awake?
JULIA Taped your eyes open.
DALE This is rape!
DALE You raped me!
JULIA Don't get all dramatic.
JULIA Your dick wasn't hard.
JULIA But it will be next time.
JULIA Or else Stacy here gets a look at my photo album.
She holds up the packet of photos.
Now, let's repair this patient's filling, shall we?
Dale gapes at her, dumbstruck.
Kurt and Nick are playing a videogame as Dale bursts through the front door.
DALE Let's kill the bitch.
KURT Huh?
NICK What bitch?
DALE My boss.
DALE Our bosses.
DALE They need to die.
Nick and Kurt exchange a look.
NICK We were drunk last night, man.
NICK And didn't you say killing was wrong?
DALE That was before Julia tried to fuck me on top of my fiancee's unconscious body.
KURT Whoa!
DALE I say we kill them all.
DALE Are you guys in or out?
KURT I was in last night.
DALE Yes!
DALE Nick?
They both turn to Nick who is uncertain.
Kurt spots the photo of Nick with his GRANDMOTHER and grabs it off the wall.
KURT Look at her.
KURT Look at Bubby.
NICK Gam Gam.
KURT Look at Gam Gam.
KURT Getting a smooch from her favorite grandson.
KURT Little does she know that she'll never get to say goodbye to him.
KURT And why?
KURT Because his shithead boss wouldn't let him leave.
KURT What would Gam Gam want you to do?
NICK Probably not kill him.
KURT This isn't about Gam Gam.
KURT This is about you.
KURT What do you want, Nick?
NICK I want him to die.
KURT Damn straight!
NICK Okay, I'm in.
KURT All right!
KURT Let's do this.
How do we do this?
DALE I was thinking about that on my way over.
DALE Stacy and I watch a lot of `Law & Order' and there's a ton of ways criminals mess up.
DALE Things we'd never think of.
DALE They leave behind clothing fibers, bullet casings, hair, skin cells --
KURT Skin cells?!
KURT I can't even keep track of my keys!
DALE Exactly.
DALE And that's why we need a professional.
NICK What are you talking about, a hitman?
KURT You know, that's not bad.
KURT I mean, we don't clean our own apartments, right?
KURT We hire someone to clean them for us.
DALE Maybe you do, moneybags.
NICK But where are we supposed to find a hitman?
DALE That's the only problem.
DALE I have no idea.
There's a beat.
Kurt's eyes light up.
KURT I do.
KURT Meet at my place tomorrow after work.
KURT And make sure you're not followed.
NICK Why would anyone follow us?
KURT I don't know.
KURT People get followed.
DALE What people?
KURT Just meet me at my place.
Kurt opens the door on Nick and Dale.
The decor of Kurt's place is best described as a middle-income bachelor pad.
KURT Come in.
KURT The guy should be here pretty soon.
NICK Wait.
NICK You actually found someone?!
KURT It was as easy as buying a used futon.
He points to his computer.
On the screen is a listing
DALE Craigslist?!
DALE You found a hitman on Craigslist.
KURT Yup.
KURT But they don't post it as `hitman.' That would be stupid.
KURT They use code words, like `liquidation,' `pest control,' `wet work.' Check it out.
KURT This is our guy.
Nick reads the listing.
NICK `Skilled professional with years of experience in domestic and international wet work.
NICK Fast and discreet.
NICK No children or political figures.'
KURT See?
KURT He's principled.
DALE This is so dangerous.
DALE What if he's a narc?
NICK Yeah, Kurt.
NICK Call him back and cancel.
KURT It's too late.
KURT He's on his way.
DALE What do we do if this guy gets here and he asks for so much money that we can't afford him and he gets mad and kills all of us?
KURT I don't think he'd stay in business long if he killed everyone who couldn't afford him.
NICK Guys!
NICK I think this is him!
The others hurry to look.
From --
We see a black Mercedes SLK pull up.
A distinguished- looking MAN in a well-tailored suit steps out.
He wears sunglasses and carries a briefcase.
NICK Nice car.
KURT Whoa.
KURT This guy's legit.
DALE I bet that briefcase has one of those guns you have to screw together.
NICK All right, let's just be professional here.
NICK We don't want to seem all giddy.
A knock at the door.
How's my hair?
It doesn't matter!
Kurt opens the door on the Man who looks even smoother up close.
Is one of you Kurt?
DALE Oh my God, he's like James Bond!
KURT Yes, hi, I'm Kurt.
KURT Please come in.
MAN Thank you.
MAN Are all three of you participating in this?
NICK Yes, we are.
MAN Very well.
MAN Now before we go any further, I need to know if there are any hidden recording devices in this room.
MAN I will find out if there are.
DALE No, no!
DALE We definitely don't want to record this, sir.
MAN Then let's get started.
He walks to the middle of the living room, opens his briefcase and takes out a plastic tarp which he proceeds to unfurl over the carpet.
KURT Whoa, whoa.
KURT What's that for?
MAN For the mess.
NICK We don't want you to kill us!
Oh my God!
I knew it!
MAN Kill you?
MAN What are you talking about?
The guys exchange a confused look.
KURT Your ad said you do wet work.
MAN That's correct.
MAN I urinate on other men for money.
NICK/KURT What?!
MAN Why do you think my ad was in the `men seeking men' section?
You were looking in `men seeking men'?!
KURT Yeah!
KURT We're men seeking a man, aren't we?
NICK You are such a moron.
MAN So you're telling me I drove all the way to the Valley and no one wants to be pissed on?
DALE Please don't kill us.
MAN I don't kill people!
MAN Can I use your rest room?
MAN I've stored up rather a large amount of pee for this.
It's right through there.
The Man heads off.
After a beat --
KURT Good thing I didn't call the guy who was offering to do `dirty work.'
Kurt drives.
Nick is in the passenger seat.
Dale in back.
KURT All right, I'll take the blame for that one.
NICK That's big of you.
KURT I'm going to make it up to you.
KURT I figured out a much better way to find a contract killer.
DALE What's that?
Kurt reaches up and pushes a button on the rear-view mirror.
A male voice comes over the speaker.
Hello, Mr. Gamble, thank you for contacting On Star --
DALE Oh, come on!
This is your plan?
ON STAR REP (V.O.) -- my name is Gregory.
ON STAR REP (V.O.) How can I be of service this evening?
KURT Gregory, I need you to direct me to the most dangerous bar in Los Angeles.
ON STAR REP (V.O.) I'm sorry?
KURT We need to find the bar with the most scumbags, lowlifes and hardcore shitheads.
KURT Can you help us out?
ON STAR REP (V.O.) I'm afraid our listings are not organized by danger, sir.
ON STAR REP (V.O.) I do see there is a Bennigan's three blocks from your current
KURT Okay, Gregory?
KURT That's unhelpful.
KURT While I'm sure there are plenty of shitheads there, they're not the kind of shitheads we need.
ON STAR REP (V.O.) I can direct you to the neighborhood with the greatest number of car-jackings in your area.
KURT Now we're talking.
ON STAR REP (V.O.) Very good, sir.
ON STAR REP (V.O.) You may wish to lock your doors.
Kurt's car drives down a depressed-looking block.
The guys are still chatting with Gregory.
NICK So, do you like living in Bangalore?
It's not bad.
Humid.
DALE Now, `Gregory.' Is that your real name?
GREGORY (V.O.) No, sir.
GREGORY (V.O.) My real name is Atmanand.
KURT Atmanand?
KURT How did you get Gregory from that?
GREGORY (V.O.) `Gregory' was assigned to me by On Star.
NICK Why don't they let you use your real name?
GREGORY (V.O.) Many Americans find our real names off-putting.
KURT Actually, I do find Atmanand a little off-putting.
You have arrived at your destination, sir.
Thank you, Gregory./Thanks, Gregory.
Kurt's car pulls up on a grimy-looking South-Central street and stops in front of a dingy bar.
The guys get out and look around warily.
KURT This must be the place.
DALE Aren't you worried about your car?
KURT Nah, Gregory's watching it.
NICK You really think we're gonna find a hitman in there?
KURT I think we're gonna have a hard time deciding between all the hitmen in there.
KURT Trust me, these are the lowest of the low.
The three guys enter the squalid, smoky place.
The room is full of surly-looking PATRONS, none of them white.
People turn to stare.
NICK Oh, real nice, Kurt.
NICK Way to be racist.
KURT This isn't a race thing.
KURT We need a criminal and this neighborhood is where they live.
KURT I'm not saying that's because there are a lot of black people here.
KURT That's the fault of our society that discriminates and disenfranchises them.
DALE You said they were the lowest of the low.
KURT I was speaking socio-economically.
NICK So what do we do now?
NICK Yell out `anyone here kill people for money?'
KURT Let me handle this.
They each take a seat at the bar where a no-nonsense BARTENDER walks over to them.
BARTENDER Yeah?
KURT Hey.
KURT How you doing?
KURT Nice place.
Listen, does anyone here kill people for money?
NICK Kurt!
An intense-looking GUY on the next stool notices them.
BARTENDER The fuck did you just say?
KURT Don't get me wrong.
KURT This isn't about race.
KURT Our society discriminates and disenfranchises
DALE Oh my God.
BARTENDER I'm a small business owner.
BARTENDER Who are you calling disenfranchised?
KURT I didn't mean you in particular.
BARTENDER Right.
BARTENDER You mean all black people.
NICK Maybe we should go?
BARTENDER You could do that.
BARTENDER Or I could take the aluminum baseball bat I'm holding in my right hand and disenfranchise your teeth from your mouth.
DALE I vote we go.
The three stand and head for the door.
KURT Okay, we're going.
KURT I'm sorry if I offended you.
KURT It was never my --
BARTENDER Oh shit, please shut up.
KURT Okey doke.
The guys come out onto the sidewalk.
DALE This is ridiculous.
DALE We're never gonna find someone to do this for us.
COCKSUCKER JONES Yo!
They turn to see COCKSUCKER JONES, 30s, the guy who was sitting next to them at the bar.
COCKSUCKER JONES I think I can help you boys.
He gestures for them to follow him into the alley beside the bar.
Kurt and Nick move to follow.
DALE Oh, we're just gonna follow him into that alley?...
DALE All right.
Cocksucker Jones leans in to the three guys.
COCKSUCKER JONES I heard you're looking for someone to take care of some business for you?
NICK Yes, we are.
NICK Are you a...
NICK businessman?
COCKSUCKER JONES (putting out his
Cocksucker Jones.
NICK Excuse me?
COCKSUCKER JONES That's my name.
DALE Your first name is Cocksucker?
COCKSUCKER JONES And my last name's Jones.
COCKSUCKER JONES You got a problem with that?
DALE No, no.
DALE It's just interesting.
DALE That's the name on your birth certificate?
COCKSUCKER JONES Naw, man.
COCKSUCKER JONES It's a nickname.
COCKSUCKER JONES My real name is Dean.
DALE Oh!
DALE Like Dean Jones.
DALE The actor from Herbie the Love Bug.
KURT I don't think he knows who Dean Jones is.
COCKSUCKER JONES I know who Dean Jones is, bitch!
COCKSUCKER JONES I can't walk around here with that kind of faggy, cracker name.
NICK So you chose `cocksucker'?
COCKSUCKER JONES That's right.
COCKSUCKER JONES Nobody fucks with a cocksucker.
COCKSUCKER JONES `Cocksucker' is the toughest name there is.
DALE Not `motherfucker'?
COCKSUCKER JONES I considered Motherfucker.
COCKSUCKER JONES But in the end, I thought Cocksucker Jones sounded more badass than Motherfucker Jones.
KURT I agree.
NICK Okay, here's the thing: we each work for a boss that we need to get rid of.
NICK Is that something you might be able to help us with?
COCKSUCKER JONES It is.
COCKSUCKER JONES Assuming you've got the cheese.
KURT We've got cheese.
KURT How much cheese are we talking?
COCKSUCKER JONES For three hits?
COCKSUCKER JONES That's gonna run you thirty large.
NICK That's a lot of cheese.
KURT We don't have that much cheese.
DALE Isn't there any kind of discount because we're buying three at once?
DALE Like buy two, get one free.
COCKSUCKER JONES This ain't the motherfucking Cold Stone Creamery.
COCKSUCKER JONES It's thirty large or nothing.
NICK There's no way we can pay that.
COCKSUCKER JONES Five large.
DALE Wow.
Good negotiating.
NICK That's a lot more reasonable.
NICK And that would be for all three, Cocksucker?
COCKSUCKER JONES Yeah.
KURT Great.
KURT We're in.
COCKSUCKER JONES Okay, meet me back here tomorrow night with the cash.
COCKSUCKER JONES I'll take care of the rest.
NICK Should we bring the bills in any kind of special denominations?
COCKSUCKER JONES No, just, whatever.
COCKSUCKER JONES Small bills.
NICK Got it.
KURT And do you want it in any particular container, like a shoebox?
NICK Or a paper bag?
DALE Or plastic.
DALE I read an article that plastic is actually better for the environment than paper.
COCKSUCKER JONES Fuck the environment!
COCKSUCKER JONES Just put that shit in a briefcase.
NICK Got it.
NICK Thanks.
NICK Come on, guys.
DALE Should we deduct the cost of the briefcase?
COCKSUCKER JONES What?!
DALE I mean, assuming we don't get the case back...
DALE We're not getting the case back, right?
Cocksucker glares at him.
DALE Well, that's like an extra eighty bucks.
DALE Only seems fair that we should take that out of your end.
NICK We'll cover the briefcase, Dale.
DALE Then let's get a cheap one.
DALE It doesn't have to be real leather.
DALE Are you cool with faux -- ?
Kurt grabs Dale by the shoulder and hustles him to the car.
MUSIC CUE: Frank Sinatra's "(Forget Your Troubles, Come On) Get Happy"
-- Dale, Kurt and Nick each take a turn at an ATM machine, withdrawing the maximum amount they can.
-- Nick at his desk at work.
He looks over his cubicle wall and his eyes narrow as he sees Harken directing a WORKMAN who stencils the words "Senior Vice President of Sales" below where it already says "President."
Another WORKMAN uses a sledgehammer on the wall of the office.
Nick grins malevolently.
-- Kurt is at his desk in the chemical company.
He looks up to see Bobby Pellit open his office door and lead out two obvious HOOKERS.
Pellit has white powder around his nostrils.
He spots Kurt watching him and he sneers back.
Kurt smiles devilishly.
-- CLOSE ON Dale as he places tooth X-rays into plastic contact sheets.
PULL BACK to reveal Julia is licking his neck while tweaking his nipples through his scrubs.
In contrast to earlier, Dale appears to be unfazed and almost amused by Julia's antics.
Cocksucker Jones holds an open briefcase that's empty but for a single stack of taped together 20-dollar bills.
COCKSUCKER JONES Looks like it's all here.
DALE Turns out we didn't really need the briefcase after all.
DALE Could've just used a manila envelope.
KURT Shut up, Dale.
NICK So, Cocksucker, how long do you think it'll be before you've...
NICK taken care of business?
COCKSUCKER JONES Here's the thing.
COCKSUCKER JONES I just got out of doing a dime for some pretty ugly shit and I'm still on probation.
COCKSUCKER JONES They're watching me.
COCKSUCKER JONES So if I step out of line, I go right back inside.
KURT You told us you could take care of it.
COCKSUCKER JONES And I'm gonna.
COCKSUCKER JONES I'm gonna be your professional advisor.
COCKSUCKER JONES Think of me as your murder consultant.
NICK We don't want a murder consultant.
NICK We want a murderer.
DALE I knew we were getting ripped off!
KURT Okay, look.
KURT This isn't what we talked about.
KURT (CONT'D) Can we just get our money back, please?
KURT (CONT'D) Then we'll be on our way.
COCKSUCKER JONES Sorry, no refunds.
NICK That's five thousand dollars.
NICK You think we're just gonna walk away and let you keep that?
COCKSUCKER JONES I think you're forgetting who you're talking to.
Cocksucker pulls back the lower edge of his jacket to reveal what appears to be the holster of a gun.
DALE Whoa, whoa!
DALE We don't want any trouble.
COCKSUCKER JONES Now either I give you the advice you paid for, or you can walk away with nothing.
COCKSUCKER JONES Up to you.
KURT Look, the whole reason we came to you is because we don't have the experience to do it ourselves.
COCKSUCKER JONES Most killers are first-timers.
COCKSUCKER JONES Look, the key to a good murder is making it look like an accident.
COCKSUCKER JONES Gas leak, brakes failing, suicide, that sort of thing.
COCKSUCKER JONES If you do it right, you won't even have to be there when it goes down.
NICK That makes sense.
NICK But how would we fake three accidents?
COCKSUCKER JONES You need to stalk your prey, track their movements, get to know them inside and out.
COCKSUCKER JONES Where do they go?
COCKSUCKER JONES What do they eat for breakfast?
COCKSUCKER JONES Who're they fucking?
DALE You're talking about surveillance and recon.
COCKSUCKER JONES But making it look like an accident won't be enough if the pigs can pin a motive on you.
NICK Well, we all have obvious motives for killing our bosses.
COCKSUCKER JONES So why don't you kill each other's bosses?
DALE Hey, that's a good idea.
DALE Like Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train.
KURT The Danny DeVito movie?
DALE Yes, the famous Alfred Hitchcock/Danny DeVito movie.
DALE You're thinking of Throw Mama from the Train.
DALE But it's actually the same idea.
DALE If we kill each other's bosses there's no link to us.
NICK That's pretty good.
COCKSUCKER JONES That's what you're paying me for.
COCKSUCKER JONES Now ain't that worth five grand?
The guys all AD LIB "no's."
COCKSUCKER JONES Yeah, well, too fucking bad.
Nick is poring over a stack of documents when his phone rings.
Kurt and Dale wait in the car outside of Nick's office.
KURT We're outside.
KURT You ready for a little recon?
NICK Yeah.
NICK I just need to get Harken to let me leave early.
KURT What's the difference?
KURT He's not going to be your boss much longer.
If I get fired before we kill Harken, this'll all have been for nothing.
I'll just be an out-of- work murderer.
I'll be down in three minutes.
He hangs up then peers over his cubicle wall to see Harken talking to another EMPLOYEE nearby.
Nick takes a breath, leans over his garbage pail and sticks a Commtronix pen down his throat.
At the sound of Nick's loud WRETCHING, Harken looks over to see him puking into the trash pail.
HARKEN What in God's name...?!
Sorry, sir.
I've been fighting this bug all day.
I'll just get back to work --
Nick wipes his mouth and turns pathetically back to his desk.
HARKEN No.
HARKEN Go home.
HARKEN I don't want you getting everyone else sick.
NICK Oh, okay.
NICK Thank you, Mr. Harken.
HARKEN Wait.
HARKEN Take your work with you.
HARKEN Have it on my desk at six AM.
Nick barely conceals his contempt as he picks up the stack of papers and heads out.
Disgusting.
Kurt's car pulls up slowly and parks.
Kurt, Dale and Nick slump down in their seats.
KURT Okay, boys, as soon as Pellit makes a move, we tail him.
KURT It is on now.
NICK Oh, it's on.
DALE Hells yeah!
They watch the house with steely determination.
The guys are bored out of their minds, barely awake.
Dale nibbles on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a plastic bag.
KURT Ugghhhhh, I can't believe how much this sucks.
DALE I don't get it.
DALE On TV, surveillance always looks so great.
DALE They've got their cups of coffee.
DALE Their sunflower seeds.
DALE They talk about their lives.
And then, right when they reveal something really intimate, the perp appears and they spring into action.
A long, silent pause as they watch the house...
NICK Are we even sure he's home?
They exchange looks.
KURT Let's go check it out.
The three guys creep around Pellit's patio, peeking in doors and windows.
Finally:
NICK I don't see him.
Kurt is about to try a window when Dale stops him.
DALE What are you doing?
KURT We're not gonna get intel standing on his lawn.
KURT We have to go in.
DALE What about fingerprints?
DALE We don't have gloves.
KURT Here, do this.
Kurt pulls his shirt sleeves down over his hands.
Dale does the same.
Nick, who wears a T-shirt, tucks his hands inside the bottom of the shirt.
With some difficulty, Kurt slides open the window.
KURT Here we go.
The three of them manage to wriggle through the window.
It's not graceful: Dale's foot gets caught on the sill, causing him to tumble on top of Nick and Kurt.
At last, all three are inside.
KURT Dale, keep an eye out.
KURT Let us know if Pellit's coming.
DALE Got it.
DALE Wait, I don't know what he looks like.
NICK It doesn't matter.
NICK Just tell us if anyone comes.
DALE Got it.
They take in Pellit's living room.
There's a leather sofa, a 60-inch plasma and enormous speakers.
On the wall are framed Ed Hardy posters depicting dragons and half-naked girls.
KURT Wow.
KURT This guy's a bigger douchebag than me.
NICK Okay, let's split up.
NICK Look for any intel we can use on him.
KURT What kind of intel?
NICK I don't know.
NICK I guess we'll know it when we see it.
Kurt heads upstairs while Dale and Nick look around the living room.
DALE Hey, Nick?
DALE Does this count as intel?
Nick looks over to see Dale holding in his sleeve-covered hands an open wooden box filled with white powder.
NICK Holy shit, that's a lot of blow.
DALE God, this must be worth, like, ten thousand -- oh shit!
Suddenly, the box slips out of Dale's hands.
It hits the floor, sending a cascade of cocaine all over the rug.
NICK What the fuck?!!
DALE Sorry, my sleeves were slippery!
NICK We've got to get that back in the box.
DALE I've got it.
Kurt looks around the room.
He doesn't see anything useful so he heads into --
He flips on the light.
His eyes land on Pellit's toothbrush.
He grins slyly.
Dale is still on his knees, scooping up coke, as Nick returns from the kitchen cradling a Dustbuster in his T- shirt.
NICK Look out.
NICK Let me try this.
Which is now filled not only with cocaine, but bits of hair, dust bunnies, food and other crap.
DALE I guess we should've emptied the Dustbuster before we used it.
NICK You think?
Just BELOW FRAME, Kurt removes Pellit's toothbrush from his ass and returns it to its holder, careful to keep his hands covered with his sleeves.
He's about to go when he notices a bar of Neutrogena face soap beside the sink.
He looks around deviously.
Dale and Nick are doing their best to pick the crap out of Pellit's cocaine.
DALE Hey look, there's a piece of cereal in here.
DALE Can't tell if that's a corn flake or a frosted flake...
Kurt comes down the stairs.
KURT Okay, my work upstairs is done.
KURT You guys ready to split?
Kurt pulls away from the curb.
NICK We need to be better prepared.
NICK That was totally dangerous and a complete waste of time.
KURT Not a complete waste.
He pulls a BlackBerry out of his pocket.
NICK Oh no...
NICK don't tell me...
DALE You stole that from Pellit's house?
KURT It's got his calendar and his contacts.
KURT This is what recon's all about.
Nobody said we'd be stealing.
KURT Shall we pay a little visit to your boss, Nick?
NICK I guess so.
NICK But let's make a stop first.
Nick emerges from the store with a plastic bag and gets into Kurt's car.
DALE What did you need to get?
Nick holds up a box of latex gloves.
NICK No more sleeve gloves.
DALE Nice.
KURT Oh man, you should've asked me.
KURT I've got a whole box of those in my bedside table.
KURT (off their grossed-
Don't judge me.
NICK Take a right up here.
NICK Harken's place is about a mile away.
DALE Y'know...
DALE this is kinda, I don't know...
DALE exciting.
KURT Very.
NICK Yeah.
I guess we're really doing this now, huh?
I guess so.
A two-story house with a tidy yard.
Kurt's car pulls up.
Kurt and Nick begin pulling on their gloves.
DALE Can I have a pair?
NICK You know, last time with the three of us, it got a little...
NICK messy.
NICK What if Kurt and I go in and you stay here and watch out for Harken?
DALE Okay -- again, I don't know what he looks like.
NICK If anyone approaches the house, assume it's him and give us a signal.
DALE Fine.
DALE I'll honk the horn six times.
KURT Maybe something a little more subtle?
DALE Honk the horn four times?
NICK How about you just honk once?
DALE People honk once all the time.
DALE You'll be running in and out of the house.
KURT Fine.
KURT Honk twice.
Okay...
Nick and Kurt get out of the car.
After a beat, Dale remembers his sandwich and pulls it out of his pocket.
Kurt and Nick sneak up to the front porch which is camouflaged by shrubs.
They peek inside.
Looks like the coast is clear.
Kurt tries the windows.
They're locked.
KURT Damn.
KURT Guess we'll have to break in the old-fashioned way.
Kurt looks around and spots a small rock beside the porch.
He picks it up and winds back to throw it at the window.
NICK Kurt, wait!
But it's too late.
Kurt has released the rock.
It HITS the window, but instead of breaking the glass, the rock itself BREAKS into two pieces.
KURT Holy shit.
KURT I broke the rock.
NICK No, it's one of those hide-a-key things.
NICK Look...
Nick shows Kurt a key concealed in one half of the fake rock.
He grabs it and inserts it into the front door lock.
The guys tiptoe in, whispering and tense.
The place is tastefully decorated with attractive furniture and modern art.
There is a vase of flowers on a table.
NICK Wow.
NICK This is not how I pictured his place.
KURT For all we know, he's got a closet full of skin suits.
A CAT springs out of nowhere, startling them, then runs off.
NICK Jesus!
KURT Stupid cat.
Let's check upstairs.
They head up.
Dale is finishing the last of his peanut butter sandwich.
He checks the rearview mirror.
No sign of anyone.
DALE (singing a la Cher,
`Do you believe in love after love/I can feel something inside me say/I really don't think you're strong enough now...'
Just as Kurt and Nick enter, the cat suddenly jumps out from behind the door, startling them again.
KURT God damn it!
KURT How many cats do they have?
NICK I think that was the same one.
KURT Little bastard.
Kurt notices a framed wedding photo on the dresser of Harken and Mrs. Harken.
KURT Damn.
KURT That's Mrs. Harken?
KURT I'd like to cover her in cock yogurt.
NICK You want to cover every woman in...
NICK did you say `cock yogurt'?
KURT I did.
Yet again, Kurt and Nick jump as the cat LEAPS out of hiding with a YOWL then runs off.
KURT Ahhh!
NICK If he's so scared of us, why doesn't he just leave us alone?!
Dale plays a bowling game on his cell phone.
DALE C'mon, c'mon...
DALE yes!
Just then, Harken, in running attire, comes jogging up the street.
His eye is caught by the plastic bag falling from the car window onto the street.
He stops and angrily picks up the bag.
HARKEN Hey, schmuck.
Dale, surprised, turns to the window.
DALE Excuse me?
HARKEN You want to tell me why you're littering on my street?
DALE Oh, I'm sorry, that blew out the window.
DALE I wasn't littering.
HARKEN I don't care if it blew out of your twat.
HARKEN Now, get your fucking Chevy Cavalier the hell off my block!
DALE Whoa.
DALE Sir, there's no need to be hostile.
HARKEN Hostile?
HARKEN You want to see hostile?
HARKEN How about I go in the house and get my --
Suddenly, Harken begins to choke and his face grows increasingly red.
DALE Get your what?
With one hand Harken grabs his throat and with the other he looks at the plastic bag he's holding.
Peanuts?
DALE Huh?
DALE Oh, yeah.
DALE It was a peanut butter sandwich.
Harken collapses to his knees.
His face is turning blue now.
Dale quickly steps out of the car.
DALE Oh god!
DALE What should I do?!
DALE Tell me what to do!
Harken yanks up the right leg of his jogging pants revealing an EPI-PEN strapped to his ankle.
He reaches for it, but Dale moves faster.
DALE What do I do with this?
DALE Should I inject you?!
Harken nods urgently as his eyes begin to roll back.
DALE Okay, hold on!
DALE I got this.
Dale takes the cap off the epi-pen, raises his arm and jams the needle into Harken's chest.
Harken lets out a grunt.
DALE Did I do it?
DALE Did I get enough in?!
DALE I'm gonna do it again!
Nick continues to search around the bedroom.
Kurt is by the window.
NICK Do you see a Day Runner or an address book?
(glances out the
What the...?
Dude, check this out.
Nick joins him at the window and they both react as they see what appears to be Dale repeatedly STABBING Harken in the chest, neck and arms.
Harken lies motionless on the sidewalk.
That's Harken!
Dale's killing Harken!
KURT Holy shit!
KURT He's really doing it!
Out where everyone can see him.
NICK What the hell is he thinking?!
KURT He's not stopping.
KURT He's gonna get us all caught.
KURT We've gotta get out of here.
NICK What about Dale?
KURT He's a psychopath.
KURT We leave him behind.
NICK Right.
NICK Let's go through the back!
As Dale kneels over Harken to check his breathing, a car pulls up alongside and MRS.
HARKEN steps out.
Seeing her husband on the ground, she rushes over.
MRS. HARKEN Oh my god!
MRS. HARKEN What happened?!
DALE He had an allergic reaction.
DALE But I think he's coming around.
DALE Do you know him?
MRS. HARKEN He's my husband.
Mrs. Harken kneels beside Harken and supports his head.
MRS. HARKEN Honey?
MRS. HARKEN Can you hear me?
Harken groggily looks down at his torso which is perforated by dozens of tiny needle marks.
HARKEN Wha-- What did you do to me?
DALE I injected you with your thing.
HARKEN He saved your life, honey.
Thank you so much!
She grabs Dale in a warm hug.
DALE Oh, it was nothing.
HARKEN What's this?
HARKEN What's with the hugging?
MRS. HARKEN I'm just thankful that he was here.
HARKEN I'll bet you are.
HARKEN Do you know this guy?
MRS. HARKEN No.
MRS. HARKEN We just --
HARKEN Are you fucking him, Rhonda?
MRS. HARKEN Oh, come on.
What were you doing out here, anyway?
Waiting to fuck my wife?
I've never met your wife --
Still a bit woozy, Harken gets to his feet and points at Dale.
HARKEN You need to get the hell out of here.
MRS. HARKEN Dave, stop it.
MRS. HARKEN You should be thanking him.
MRS. HARKEN Why are you being so suspicious?
HARKEN Why?
HARKEN Because I know you sleep around on me.
HARKEN And I'm going to find out who it is.
MRS. HARKEN You're being ridiculous.
HARKEN Am I?
HARKEN What about Maurilio?
HARKEN I see the way you look at him.
MRS. HARKEN I am not having sex with the gardener!
Nick and Kurt pace nervously.
NICK I can't believe that idiot Dale.
NICK You realize we're all going to jail because of him.
KURT I can't go to jail.
KURT Look at these eyes.
KURT Look at this ass.
KURT They'll be all over me.
NICK Yeah, me too.
Well...
NICK What do you mean `well'?
NICK I'd get raped just as much as you.
No, of course you would.
You're a good-looking guy.
NICK You think you're more rape-able than I am.
KURT I never said that --
Dale enters.
DALE Oh good.
DALE You guys are here.
DALE Did you see me out there?
KURT Yeah, Dale, we saw you.
DALE Pretty neat, huh?
NICK No, it wasn't neat!
NICK You stabbed Harken to death in front of the whole neighborhood!
KURT Not cool, man.
DALE Wait, that was Harken?
NICK Who'd you think you were stabbing?
DALE I wasn't stabbing anybody.
DALE That was an epi-pen.
DALE He was having an allergic reaction to peanuts and I injected him.
Kurt and Nick digest this for a beat.
NICK So let me understand this.
NICK My boss, who we are trying to kill, was dying in front of you and you saved his life?
KURT Not cool, man.
DALE Wait, you were just mad at me for killing him and now you're mad at me for not killing him?!
See, this is why I needed to know what these people look like!
NICK Hang on a sec.
NICK Maybe this recon wasn't a waste of time.
NICK Now we know Harken's deathly allergic to peanuts and Pellit has a huge stash of cocaine.
We could put peanuts in Harken's house and rat poison in Pellit's coke!
NICK Everyone would assume that Pellit just got a batch of tainted drugs.
DALE But Harken must always have that epi-pen on him.
They consider this for a beat.
KURT I bet he doesn't wear it in the shower.
KURT We could put peanuts in his shampoo!
NICK Perfect!
NICK Two fatal accidents.
NICK And we're not even there when they happen.
DALE That just leaves Julia.
KURT Tomorrow night, I'll surveil her and figure out how to take her down.
NICK Good.
NICK I'll get some rat poison and take care of Pellit.
NICK Dale, think you can get some peanuts into Harken's shampoo?
DALE I can do that.
KURT All right.
KURT That just leaves us with one final thing to settle.
NICK What's that?
KURT Dale, if Nick and I were in prison, which one of us would get raped more?
OFF Dale's confusion and Nick's annoyance --
Nick sits in his parked car watching the house through binoculars.
Through an upstairs window, he sees Pellit enter his bedroom.
Nick checks his coat pocket and confirms it contains a Home Depot bag with rat poison inside.
Nick dials his cell phone.
Kurt sits in his car, reading Maxim magazine.
Julia's car pulls up.
She gets out, goes to the trunk, opens it, then bends down to get a bag of groceries.
Nick watches her ass appreciatively as she does and keeps watching as she heads into her building.
SFX: His cell phone rings.
Hey.
Have you learned anything about Julia yet?
KURT Well, I've learned that Dale is a homosexual because this chick is unbelievably hot.
KURT How's it going over there?
NICK I'm just waiting for Pellit to go to sleep.
NICK I wonder how Dale's doing with Harken.
Dale's car is parked.
Dale watches the movie Precious on his laptop.
He glances over to see Harken turn on the light in his bedroom.
On the seat beside Dale, we see a large jar of Planters peanuts.
Harken looks around suspiciously, then goes to Mrs.
Harken's closet.
He opens it and begins looking through her clothing.
He sniffs one of her dresses and his eyes narrow.
He sniffs himself, then compares it to the smell of the dress.
Unsatisfied, he continues searching around the room for any incriminating evidence.
Suddenly, his foot comes in contact with something on the floor.
He reaches down and picks up...
He turns it on and scrolls down the contacts list to "HOME" which shows Bobby Pellit's name and address.
Harken's face turns beet red.
Dale ducks down as he sees Harken's garage door opening.
Harken's Porsche 911 pulls out and zooms up the street.
Still scooched down, Dale dials his phone.
Nick watches Pellit performing a series of sweaty KUNG FU MOVES in a full-length mirror.
NICK Jesus, where does he get the energy?
Oh yeah.
Nick answers.
NICK What's up, Dale?
DALE Harken just left his house.
DALE I'm going in.
NICK Good luck, man.
DALE Thanks.
Dale flips on the light and enters clutching the peanut jar in his gloved hands.
He slides open the shower curtain and Harken's CAT LEAPS OUT at him.
DALE Ahhh!
Nick watches as Pellit finally gets into bed and turns off his bedside lamp.
NICK Okay.
NICK Here we go.
NICK SFX: Nick's cell phone rings.
NICK Nick jumps, then answers the phone.
Nick?
NICK What?
DALE I'm not sure if I can do this.
NICK Where are you?
DALE In Harken's bathroom.
DALE About to pour the nuts in his shampoo.
DALE But, I just...
DALE I know he's a real shithead, but he's still a person, y'know?
Lights appear in Nick's rearview mirror.
NICK (looking down at the rat poison,
Yeah.
I know.
Harken's Porsche pulls up and stops just behind Nick's car.
Harken gets out and heads toward Pellit's front door.
DALE What should I do?
DALE Should I do it?
Suddenly, Nick looks up to see HARKEN knocking on Pellit's door.
In the bedroom, Pellit's light goes on.
What the fuck?!
DALE What?
NICK It's Harken.
NICK He's here!
DALE At Pellit's?!
DALE Why?!
NICK I don't know.
NICK He's knocking on his door!
DALE How would Harken even know Pellit?
Looking irritated, Pellit answers the door.
Before he can get a word out...
...
Harken removes a gun from his pocket and SHOOTS Pellit twice in the chest.
Nick reacts, slumping down in his seat, horrified.
NICK Oh my god oh my god oh my god...
DALE What?
DALE What?
DALE What?!
NICK He shot him.
NICK Harken shot Pellit!
DALE Oh my god.
DALE Is he dead?!
NICK Shhhh!
With shaking hands, Nick reaches for his ignition but knocks the car keys out.
They fall onto the floor of the car.
Fuck!
As Nick bends down to find his keys, Harken's shadow looms over him.
Nick cowers just out of sight.
Harken looks around.
Did he hear something?
No.
He calmly but briskly walks away from Nick's car, gets into his own and speeds off.
DALE What's happening?
NICK Harken's gone.
DALE What about Pellit?
NICK He's not moving.
NICK He looks dead.
DALE Shit!
DALE What do we do?!
NICK I've got to get out of here before someone sees me!
NICK Meet me at the bar.
NICK I'll call Kurt.
Nick's car SPEEDS through a red light at an intersection.
A TRAFFIC CAMERA FLASHES as it snaps Nick's photo and license plate.
With trembling hands, Nick and Dale take deep gulps of their drinks.
Kurt hurries in, looking disheveled.
The ensuing conversation is conducted in tense whispers.
KURT Okay, let's all stay calm and figure this out.
NICK Calm?
NICK How can we be calm?
NICK I watched a man die an hour ago!
KURT A man you were going to kill anyway.
NICK Well...
KURT What?
NICK I don't know if I had it in me.
DALE Me neither.
KURT I can't believe you guys!
KURT You can't just bail on a plan like that at the last minute.
NICK You think when it came down to it, you would've been able to murder Julia?
Kurt softens.
KURT I don't know.
KURT I mean, afterwards, it was kind of hard to imagine killing her.
Nick and Dale turn to him, quizzically.
DALE `Afterwards'?
Kurt realizes what he said.
NICK You slept with her, didn't you?
Oh god.
Please tell me you didn't sleep with her.
Kurt lowers his head.
NICK You are a mess.
KURT I know, I know.
KURT But it's not my fault.
Kurt's car is parked across the street.
KURT (V.O.) At first I was surveilling her just like I was supposed to...
Kurt watches through her bedroom window as Julia undresses sexily.
KURT (V.O.) Then she started deliberately undressing in front of the window.
KURT (V.O.) With the lights on.
KURT (V.O.) She must've known I was there.
Julia enters her bedroom with a tray of food.
She wears a skimpy kimono-style robe.
She sits on her bed and unwraps a Popsicle.
KURT (V.O.) Then she made herself a little snack.
KURT (V.O.) A Popsicle...
We see Julia eat the Popsicle as suggestively as humanly possible.
Then she picks up a banana and peels it.
KURT (V.O.) ...
KURT (V.O.) then a banana....
Julia eases the whole banana into her mouth.
Then she picks up a hot dog.
KURT (V.O.) ...
KURT (V.O.) and finally a hot dog.
KURT (V.O.) I mean, three penis-shaped foods cannot be coincidence.
KURT (V.O.) And in that weird order?
KURT (V.O.) That's not a proper meal.
So you took that as an invitation to fuck her?
Julia opens her front door, stares straight at Kurt and beckons him inside with one finger.
She walks back inside, leaving the door wide open.
KURT (V.O.) No.
KURT (V.O.) I took her invitation to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her.
Kurt opens his car door so quickly he tumbles out headfirst, planting his face on the street.
He jumps up, but one ankle is tangled in the seatbelt.
He finally extricates himself and hurries to the house as fast as he can.
NICK There is something clinically wrong with you.
KURT I know.
KURT I'm a rapscallion.
DALE You're not a rapscallion.
DALE You're a whore.
DALE A filthy whore.
KURT Hey.
KURT Not nice.
KURT And besides, I think I actually solved your problem, Dale.
KURT Julia just needed a good fucking.
KURT I bet she's not going to mess with you anymore.
NICK Whatever.
NICK We have bigger fish to fry right now.
NICK What do we do about Harken?
KURT Here's what we do.
KURT We call the cops and make an anonymous tip that Harken killed Pellit.
KURT Boom.
KURT Harken's in jail.
KURT Pellit's in hell.
KURT Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her.
KURT Our problems are solved.
KURT Boom.
NICK Okay, but we should find a payphone.
NICK We don't want them tracing the call to us.
Nick, Kurt and Dale emerge from the bar.
NICK Come on, we'll take my car.
The three of them climb into Nick's car.
Before Nick can even pull out of his parking spot, they hear the WHOOP of a police siren and see the flashing lights of a SQUAD CAR behind them.
The guys' faces go white.
NICK What the hell?
Nick unrolls his window as one COP approaches his side and his PARTNER comes up on the other.
COP Are you the owner of this vehicle?
NICK Uh, yes.
NICK Is there something wrong?
COP We've got an APB on a black Kia Spectra, license 4HIG208.
NICK Can I ask why?
COP A traffic cam caught this vehicle fleeing the scene of a crime tonight.
COP I'm going to need you to follow us to the station.
KURT Officer?
KURT This is not my car.
KURT Is it okay if I just -- ?
COP All three of you, please.
Kurt, Nick and Dale sit in a waiting area looking equal parts terrified and pissed at each other.
Throughout the following, they speak in hushed voices.
DALE They know everything.
DALE We're dead.
DALE I can't believe I let you guys talk me into this!
KURT Oh, please.
KURT We were just being hypothetical.
KURT You're the one who pushed us to do it.
NICK We can't even say anything about Harken now.
KURT Why not?
NICK Uh, well, Kurt, being outside the murder victim's house because I was planning to murder him probably isn't the best alibi in the world.
KURT You know, I didn't actually do anything illegal, so...
DALE You broke into two people's houses and stole a BlackBerry!
KURT You gonna rat on me, Dale?
DALE Well, since I'm the only one without a connection to the murder, yeah, maybe I will.
NICK That means you'd also rat on me.
KURT Not if I rat on Dale first.
Just then, a burly detective, HAGAN, appears behind them.
HAGAN Gentlemen, this way, please.
Nick, Dale and Kurt sit on metal chairs across a table from Hagan and his equally burly partner, SAMSON.
Hagan slides a PHOTO across the table to Nick.
109 CLOSE ON A BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF NICK 109 taken by the traffic camera.
His terrified face is clear, as is the time stamp at the bottom.
HAGAN Do you want to explain why you were driving 61 in a 25 zone, a block from the victim's house two minutes after he was shot to death?
NICK I...
NICK was drag racing.
NICK (off their skeptical
LOOK) I am a drag racer.
LOOK) There's no law against that, is there?
HAGAN Actually there is.
SAMSON You were drag racing in a Kia Spectra?
NICK I don't win a lot.
HAGAN Here's what I don't understand.
HAGAN You're at the crime scene.
HAGAN An hour later when we find your car, you just happen to be hanging out with this guy...
HAGAN ...
HAGAN a registered sex offender --
Tsk tsk.
HAGAN ...
HAGAN and this guy...
HAGAN ...
HAGAN whose employee ID says he works for Pellit Chemicals, the victim's company.
Wait.
My boss was murdered?!
Bobby Pellit?!
You want me to get you a Kleenex?
KURT I can't believe this.
What were you doing near his house?!
Nick looks at him, pissed.
NICK Where were you during the murder?
KURT I was making love.
`Making love.'
KURT Let me ask you something, Detective.
KURT Let's say one of us knew who the shooter was and was willing to hand you that perp on a platter.
KURT Would he be entitled to some sort of immunity for that information?
Both Dale and Nick shoot daggers at him.
HAGAN No.
HAGAN But he would be entitled to some sort of jail time.
HAGAN Because if he knew who the shooter was and didn't tell us, that would be obstruction of justice.
A beat.
KURT Well, then I'm glad we have no idea who the shooter is, right, guys?
If you expect us to believe this is all just a big coincidence, we're going to be here for a long time.
DALE Okay wait!
Now it's Kurt and Nick who look nervous.
Is Dale about to crack?
DALE Saying that we'll be here for a long time implies that we can't leave.
DALE Does that mean we're under arrest?
Samson looks to Hagan who grimaces.
HAGAN No.
HAGAN We just brought you in for questioning.
DALE So, you don't have evidence constituting probable cause to arrest us?
SAMSON Not yet.
DALE Well then, we're free to go?
HAGAN Technically.
Dale nervously stands up, half expecting to be hit.
DALE Come on, guys.
The three guys head for the exit.
Nice work.
Where'd that come from?
DALE `Law & Order.'
KURT We really showed those guys.
NICK `We'?
NICK You were gonna turn us in!
KURT For, like, a second.
SAMSON Stop!
The guys turn to see Samson holding out a traffic citation.
SAMSON For speeding and running a red light.
Don't get too comfortable out there, boys.
Our forensics team is sweeping Pellit's house for fingerprints and DNA.
And they don't miss much.
We HOLD ON Kurt's face and --
Kurt pulls Pellit's toothbrush out of his butt and returns it to its holder.
Kurt suddenly looks nauseous.
Kurt drives, Nick is in front and Dale in back.
KURT We are so fucked.
NICK Maybe it's time to lawyer up.
DALE I don't have money for a lawyer.
DALE I gave all my money to Cocksucker Jones!
KURT Hey, that's right!
KURT I forgot all about Cocksucker.
KURT Why don't we ask him what to do?
NICK We did pay him five thousand dollars to be our murder consultant.
DALE Actually, it was five thousand forty with the briefcase.
OFF their looks --
Cocksucker Jones looks up from his bar stool, surprised to see Nick, Kurt and Dale.
COCKSUCKER JONES Oh damn, look who's back.
COCKSUCKER JONES How did it go with the Strangers on a Train shit?
KURT Not great.
KURT We need your help.
NICK One of our intended victims killed another of our intended victims.
Cocksucker's eyes go wide.
COCKSUCKER JONES Shut the fuck up!
COCKSUCKER JONES What kind of evil geniuses are you?
DALE We don't even know why it happened.
DALE But the cops brought us in as suspects.
DALE What do we do now?
COCKSUCKER JONES First things first.
COCKSUCKER JONES I'm gonna need another five thousand dollars.
KURT What?
KURT No way.
KURT You said the last five thousand would cover this!
COCKSUCKER JONES Okay, fine.
COCKSUCKER JONES Pay for my drink.
As Nick puts down a few bills on the bar, Dale leans in to Kurt.
Not the best negotiator, is he?
COCKSUCKER JONES Let me ask you this -- the guy who killed the other guy you were planning on killing, are the police after him too?
NICK No.
NICK They don't suspect him.
COCKSUCKER JONES All right, so you're gonna need to encourage him to turn himself in, by say, kidnapping his wife and mailing him her earlobe or something.
DALE That's horrible.
COCKSUCKER JONES Naw, the earlobe's vestigial.
COCKSUCKER JONES All right, how about you trick him into confessing what he did while you wear a wire?
KURT A wire.
KURT That's good.
Is that how the cops caught you when you murdered someone?
COCKSUCKER JONES What the hell are you talking about?
COCKSUCKER JONES I never murdered anyone.
There's a beat.
NICK What?
COCKSUCKER JONES Who told you I killed somebody?
KURT You did.
KURT You said you served a `dime' for `some pretty ugly shit.'
COCKSUCKER JONES It was ugly.
DALE What was it?
You ever see the movie Snow Falling on Cedars?
NICK/KURT No.
DALE Yes.
COCKSUCKER JONES I got caught with a video camera making a bootleg copy of that movie.
NICK You did ten years for video piracy?
COCKSUCKER JONES Hey, that's a federal offense.
COCKSUCKER JONES They take that shit serious.
I also made the mistake of representing myself at trial.
May have insulted a few of the jurors.
KURT Hold on.
KURT You're telling me we've been taking murder advice from someone whose biggest crime was taping an Ethan Hawke movie?!
COCKSUCKER JONES So you do know it.
DALE If you're not a murderer, why do you carry that gun on your belt?
COCKSUCKER JONES Gun?
He pulls back his jacket to reveal the holster we saw earlier.
COCKSUCKER JONES This is a motherfucking iPhone.
He pulls the phone out and shows them.
NICK I feel like such a moron.
COCKSUCKER JONES Well, you are a moron.
COCKSUCKER JONES You don't walk into a bar and hand a guy five thousand dollars just because he's black.
KURT Come on, guys.
KURT Let's get out of here.
The three of them turn to go.
COCKSUCKER JONES Trust me on the wire thing, though.
COCKSUCKER JONES Worked for Donnie Brasco.
COCKSUCKER JONES Bootlegged that movie too.
Hagan and Samson pull up in their car and get out.
The detectives enter to find a CRIME TECH leaning over his computer.
HAGAN You got something for us?
CRIME TECH We didn't find any foreign prints in the house, but we did get a DNA match for one of your suspects, Kurt Gamble.
SAMSON Where was it?
CRIME TECH Pellit's upstairs bathroom.
CRIME TECH His toothbrush.
CRIME TECH It had traces of Gamble's fecal matter.
HAGAN That sick bastard.
CRIME TECH That's not all.
CRIME TECH We found feces on Pellit's hairbrush, face soap, floss and razor.
SAMSON Razor?!
CRIME TECH The handle.
CRIME TECH Not the blade.
CRIME TECH This Gamble guy put just about everything in that bathroom up his ass.
HAGAN All I care about is that it puts him inside the house.
HAGAN That's enough for a warrant for him and his drag racing, sex offender friends.
HAGAN I'll call the DA.
Kurt's car pulls up with the lights off and parks.
Kurt is at the wheel, Nick sits shotgun, Dale in back.
KURT Okay, looks quiet.
KURT Is the tape recorder ready?
Dale pulls out a mini-tape recorder and hands it to Nick along with a roll of surgical tape.
DALE Fresh batteries, fresh six-hour tape, voice activated.
NICK One of us needs to tape it to our chest.
KURT I'll do it.
KURT I'm the only one without hair on my chest.
NICK That's `cause you shave it.
KURT I don't shave it.
KURT I wax it.
Nick gives Kurt the recorder and Kurt tapes it to his chest then lowers his shirt.
DALE So what do we do now?
DALE Wait for Harken to come home and ambush him?
NICK I have a better idea.
NICK Let's be in the house when he walks in.
NICK He'll be so mad, he'll be more likely to confess.
KURT Right.
KURT We'll sit there in the dark till he comes in, and then switch on a lamp.
KURT That'll freak him out.
DALE Hey, we should find an office chair so one of us can dramatically spin around and face Harken.
NICK I'll be in the chair.
KURT Why do you get to be the guy in the chair?
NICK He's my boss.
DALE We could try and find more than one office chair so the three of us can spin around at the same time.
KURT That doesn't sound intimidating.
KURT That sounds like a musical number.
DALE I guess you're right.
DALE I'll turn on the lamp.
KURT So I'm just supposed to stand there like an idiot?
NICK You're recording it all.
NICK You're the most important member of the team.
KURT Don't patronize me, Nick.
The guys tiptoe onto the porch, peeking in the windows.
Nick tries the front door...
and it swings open.
They look at each other, then quietly head inside.
The LIGHTS suddenly come on.
PARTYGOERS Surprise!
HARKEN Who are you?
NICK Uh...
NICK hi...
NICK sorry we're late.
NICK I'm Nick.
NICK I work with your husband
Aren't you the young man who helped Dave on the street the other day?
DALE Uh, yes.
DALE How's he doing?
MRS. HARKEN He's fine.
MRS. HARKEN Thanks to you.
MRS. HARKEN Did I invite you to this?
Before Nick can answer a GUEST at the window calls out.
His car just turned the corner!
Someone get the lights!
As everyone scurries to hide, Kurt finds himself pressed up against Mrs. Harken, beside the sofa.
He checks her out.
KURT Hi, we didn't formally meet.
KURT I'm Kurt.
Hi.
KURT Nick didn't tell me that his boss was married to a model.
MRS. HARKEN (noticing him now,
I'm not a model.
When did you quit?
We see Mrs. Harken is intrigued.
Just then, the front door opens and Harken enters.
The lights come on.
PARTYGOERS Surprise!
A jittery Harken nearly jumps out of his skin as the crowd starts singing "Happy Birthday."
Mrs. Harken takes Harken's arm.
MRS. HARKEN Were you surprised?
Oh, yeah.
MRS. HARKEN Look, everyone's here.
Almost everyone.
MRS. HARKEN Who are you talking about?
HARKEN I think you know.
I need to put my stuff away.
I'll be right back.
He heads off to his study, leaving his confused wife.
She notices Kurt, standing at the buffet, staring at her.
He smiles and winks.
Mrs. Harken gives him a little wave.
NICK He's going off alone.
NICK This is our chance.
DALE You guys ready?
KURT So fucking ready.
NICK Okay, stay close.
Gotcha.
The three of them head toward the study.
Just as Nick and Dale enter, Harken looks up and sees them.
HARKEN What the hell are you doing here?
You come to stab me a few more times, you lunatic?
And my wife invited you?
Are you fucking her too?
Nick tries his best to suppress his nervousness and be cool and threatening.
NICK We know what you did, Harken.
HARKEN What does that mean?
NICK We were there.
NICK We saw you kill him.
So what is this?
A shakedown?
You think you can blackmail me because you saw me kill my wife's lover?
Nick winces.
So close.
Say his name.
Nick and Harken turn to Dale.
HARKEN What?
DALE The guy you killed.
DALE What was his name?
HARKEN Trust me, Pellit's name doesn't matter anymore.
NICK There it is!
NICK Let's go, guys --
He freezes as he sees for the first time that Kurt didn't accompany them into the study.
It's just him and Dale.
Nick looks around, panicked.
HARKEN Yeah, I killed Pellit --
NICK Hang on.
NICK Hold that thought, because I want to get my friend,
HARKEN I walked right up to his door and I shot him in his fucking chest, and I'll tell you something: I liked it.
HARKEN So if you think I'm a pussy who won't do the same exact thing to some half-assed blackmailer, guess again.
NICK (looking back at the
You know who really thinks you're a pussy is my friend Kurt.
Let me go grab him and you can tell him exactly what you just --
HARKEN You're pathetic, Waters.
HARKEN You come into my home, on my goddam birthday and try and pull this shit?
HARKEN Well, guess what?
HARKEN You're a dead man.
HARKEN You...
...
you, and your friend Kurt, whoever the fuck he is.
Dead.
Men.
We didn't know it was your birthday.
Harken has crossed to a drawer and taken out a small safe.
He begins turning the combination lock.
NICK What are you doing?
NICK What's in that?
HARKEN My gun.
HARKEN Just give me a second.
124 INT. HARKEN'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 124 looking thoroughly freaked out, Nick and Dale push their way through the partygoers.
NICK We had him!
NICK We had the whole thing.
NICK What happened to Kurt?
Just then, the door to a guest bathroom opens and Kurt emerges, buckling his belt and looking strangely red in the face.
KURT Oh, hey.
NICK `Hey'?!
NICK Where were you?!
KURT Uh, I had to go to the bathroom.
KURT Bad salmon puff.
KURT Are we ready to record Harken?
NICK You're too late, Kurt!
NICK He confessed the whole damn thing!
DALE More than once!
DALE Then he told us we were dead men!
DALE He's getting his gun right now!
KURT Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
KURT I fucked up.
NICK Yeah, you --
Suddenly, the bathroom door opens again and out steps Mrs. Harken, also looking disheveled.
She adjusts her dress then rejoins the party.
NICK (realizing what Kurt
You dick!
Overcome with rage, Nick PUNCHES Kurt in the arm then rushes to the door.
Dale and Kurt hurry after him.
125 ANGLE ON HARKEN 125 seeing them go.
With a grim look, he calmly heads to the garage.
Nick sits steaming mad as Kurt drives.
Dan fiddles with the tape recorder in the back.
KURT Look, I wasn't thinking.
KURT She's so hot and I'm so weak.
KURT I'm a weak, weak man.
KURT I admit it.
From the back seat, we hear from the tape recorder:
KURT (V.O.) In here?
KURT (V.O.) But all those people are right outside.
MRS. HARKEN (V.O.) I know.
MRS. HARKEN (V.O.) That makes it even hotter.
We hear unbuckling and unzipping.
MRS. HARKEN (V.O.) Your balls are so smooth.
KURT (V.O.) I wax them.
DALE Is there anything you don't wax?
NICK Ugh.
NICK Turn it off, Dale!
KURT (V.O.) Oh yeah...
KURT (V.O.) oh shit!
MRS. HARKEN (V.O.) Whoops.
MRS. HARKEN (V.O.) That was fast...
Yeah, Dale, turn that off!
A short distance behind a car is following Kurt's.
As it comes closer we see it's a Porsche.
And it's driven by a determined-looking Harken.
Kurt's car turns the corner and stops short.
From the guys' POV we see an unmarked car and a police squad car parked outside of Kurt's place.
Hagan and Samson stand with two UNIFORMED OFFICERS.
KURT Holy shit!
KURT They must have found my DNA.
NICK Turn around!
NICK Get us out of here!
Kurt quickly does a U-turn and ZOOMS off in the direction they came, inadvertently SPEEDING through a red light.
We see a traffic camera FLASH.
131 INSERT - A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH 131 clearly showing the three guys, their faces distorted with panic.
KURT Okay, it's clear that none of us can go home again.
KURT Probably ever.
DALE What?!
KURT I'm sure they have cops at all our places.
KURT I think our best bet is to get out of the country.
NICK Where are we going to go?
KURT Mexico?
DALE Everyone flees to Mexico.
DALE That's the first place they'll look.
KURT You're right.
KURT What about Asia?
KURT We could become kick boxers.
NICK What the fuck are you talking about?
KURT What if our entire lives have been leading up to this moment?
KURT What if we were destined from the very beginning to become Asian kick boxers?
NICK What if I was destined to smack you right in the face?
KURT That seems like a lesser destiny.
SFX: Dale's cell phone rings.
Hello?
Julia lies in a bubble bath, a glass of wine on the edge of the tub.
JULIA Hello, lover.
DALE Oh God.
DALE Look, Julia, I can't talk right now --
DALE He makes an "I'm not here" gesture.
JULIA No worries, baby.
JULIA I actually meant to call your home phone.
JULIA You know, to tell Stacy about us.
DALE No!
DALE Wait!
JULIA I think I've waited long enough.
JULIA I'm tired of you playing with my emotions.
DALE I'm not playing.
DALE I'm going to do it.
DALE I swear!
JULIA This Friday.
JULIA At the office.
DALE Fine!
JULIA Wait.
JULIA What are you going to do to me?
DALE I'm going to...
DALE have sex with you.
JULIA Details!
JULIA And be explicit.
DALE Right now?
DALE You want me to say it?
KURT Oh, shit.
KURT We've got company.
He points out the back window and the guys react as they see Harken driving directly on their tail.
NICK It's Harken!
NICK Lose him!
KURT Lose him?
KURT Sure, Nick.
KURT His 500 horsepower is no match for my 150.
Say it!
I'm gonna put my penis in your pussy!
Despite the danger, Kurt and Nick turn curiously to look at Dale.
JULIA Oh, come on, Casanova.
JULIA You can do better than that.
I'm gonna make you feel good.
With my tongue...
and my fingers.
And whatnot.
Just then, Harken speeds up and SLAMS into the tail of Kurt's car.
Kurt struggles to stay on the road.
NICK Jesus Christ, this guy's nuts!
JULIA You going to slap me with your cock, Dale?
DALE Yes!
DALE Yes!
DALE I'm going to beat your face with my cock!
JULIA More!
I'm gonna put my balls in your hair!
I'm gonna spit on your arms!
Kurt and Nick exchange a baffled look.
JULIA See you Friday, you dirty bird.
Julia hangs up.
Dale looks like he's been violated.
DALE Nice job `fucking the crazy out of her,' Kurt!
KURT Maybe I should've spit on her arms.
ON STAR REP (V.O.) Good evening, Mr. Gamble.
The three of them JUMP, startled by the sudden voice in the car with them.
KURT What the hell?
ON STAR REP (V.O.) This is Gregory, your On Star rep.
ON STAR REP (V.O.) Our on-board sensors report that you have a damaged tail light.
KURT Yeah, thanks, Gregory, we know.
KURT We're being chased by a crazy man and he just smashed into us!
Kurt looks in the rearview mirror and sees Harken is still behind them.
As his car reaches an intersection, Kurt swerves at the last second and takes a hard left.
Harken overshoots the turn.
ON STAR REP (V.O.) Oh dear.
ON STAR REP (V.O.) I will alert the local police authorities and direct them to your location.
NICK No, wait!
NICK Don't call the police!
NICK They're already after us.
DALE They think we murdered someone.
Suddenly, Kurt's engine dies and the car comes to a gradual stop.
NICK Why are you slowing down?!
KURT I'm not!
KURT The engine died!
ON STAR REP (V.O.) I have remotely disabled your engine.
KURT Why would you do that, Gregory?!
ON STAR REP (V.O.) It's a standard On Star safety protocol when we believe a driver has committed a crime.
KURT I pay nineteen bucks a month for this fucking service!
ON STAR REP (V.O.) Please stay with your vehicle.
ON STAR REP (V.O.) The police should arrive shortly.
DALE I thought you were our friend, Gregory!
There's a sound of screeching tires and Harken's Porsche ZOOMS up behind them.
NICK He's not stopping!
KURT Oh, shit!
Harken's car PLOWS into the rear of Kurt's, forcing it into the back of a parked car.
Even if the engine was working, there'd be nowhere to go now.
Dazed from the impact, the guys look back to see Harken slowly approaching on foot, holding a gun in his hand.
DALE Shit, shit, shit...
Harken taps on Kurt's window with the barrel of the gun.
Kurt lowers the window.
KURT I'm guessing you don't want to
information -- ?
HARKEN Out of the car.
HARKEN All of you.
The three guys nervously exit the car and face Harken who points the gun at them.
NICK Look, Mr. Harken --
HARKEN Shut the fuck up!
HARKEN I've got six bullets in here.
HARKEN So if I want to, I can shoot each of you twice, just like I did that bastard, Pellit.
HARKEN But if I do that, I'll have to spend the rest of my life running from the law or rotting in jail.
Police sirens approaching.
So, you're not gonna shoot us?
HARKEN No.
HARKEN I have a better idea.
Harken turns the gun toward his own thigh and FIRES.
HARKEN Unnnnhhhh!
NICK What the -- ?!
As his leg bleeds, Harken wipes the gun off with his shirt, then suddenly tosses it to Dale.
HARKEN Catch.
Now I can tell the cops that when I discovered you three killed Pellit, you tried to kill me to shut me up.
KURT That's crazy!
Down the street, two squad cars turn the corner and speed toward them.
Dale looks down at the gun in his hand and drops it.
HARKEN Is it?
HARKEN Because I don't see a shred of evidence proving that I killed Pellit.
HARKEN It's like I've always told you, Nick.
HARKEN Life is a marathon and you can't win a marathon without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples.
Nick deflates.
The three guys realize Harken's won.
Then, from the car's open window they hear:
ON STAR REP (V.O.) Did I mention that this conversation is being recorded?
Kurt, Nick and Dale exchange a look of shock and relief.
HARKEN Who said that?
That's Gregory, our On Star rep.
My name is Atmanand!
Harken's face falls.
He looks around nervously as the police cars come to a halt.
HARKEN You can't -- this isn't --
NICK I think this is gonna work out okay for us.
KURT I told you.
Should we stop him?
KURT Probably.
NICK I've got this.
NICK This is for you, Gam Gam.
NICK As the COPS hurry toward them, Nick kneels on the back of Harken's neck, pinning him.
HARKEN Get the fuck off me!
Kurt steps up and kneels beside the battered figure.
Hey, Harken, one last thing?
What?!
KURT Your wife gives great head.
Harken struggles wildly but he's helpless.
The sun is shining.
Birds are chirping.
It's a bright, new day as Kurt heads into the building.
Kurt enters and looks over at what was Pellit's office.
He smiles when he sees Margie, the pregnant employee, now running the company.
He heads over.
Kurt knocks on the doorframe and enters.
MARGIE Oh, hey, Kurt.
MARGIE Come in.
KURT Thanks, Margie.
KURT I just wanted to congratulate you on taking over Bobby's job.
MARGIE Thank you.
MARGIE Terrible what happened to him.
KURT Yeah.
KURT Tough month for the Pellit family.
KURT Anyway, if there's anything I can do to help out before the baby gets here, please let me know.
What baby?
KURT Your baby.
MARGIE I'm not pregnant.
Yeah, right.
Look at that big belly.
Kurt pats her belly.
Margie now looks genuinely pissed off.
MARGIE I'm aware that I have a weight problem, Kurt.
MARGIE It just happens to manifest itself in my lower abdomen.
KURT I...
KURT oh, my God.
KURT I'm really sorry, Margie --
He falls silent under Margie's death stare.
Kurt, I know you were a favorite of Jack's.
He was willing to overlook your inappropriate behavior with female clients and service people.
But you should be aware, I'm not Jack.
And I have very little tolerance for the mistreatment of women.
So consider this your first strike.
KURT How was I supposed to know you were just fat --
MARGIE Strike two.
Julia enters to find Dale waiting for her.
A PATIENT lies asleep in the chair, his face obscured by the nitrous mask.
JULIA Thank God it's Friday, right, Dale?
Yeah.
JULIA Let's drill this patient and then you can drill me.
DALE Could we do it on top of the patient?
DALE I like the element of danger.
You continue to surprise me, you weird little man.
Julia quickly undoes the patient's belt and yanks his pants down.
You like that?
This getting you hot?
DALE Oh, yeah.
Julia begins handling the patient's implied genitals which are obscured by a tray of tools.
JULIA `I wish I was Dale's weenie so I could have sex with Julia.'
Suddenly, the patient bursts out LAUGHING and sits up.
JULIA What the hell?!
The patient pulls off his nitrous mask to reveal it's KENNY, the guys' former classmate from the bar.
Sorry, Dale.
I couldn't keep it together anymore --
JULIA What is this?
DALE Julia, meet my old high school friend, Kenny.
KENNY How do you do?
DALE Kenny will do just about anything for fifty bucks and that's why I hired him to help me frame you.
DALE Your days of sexually assaulting me and your patients are over.
Seriously?
This is all you've got?
Your word against mine?
I'm a highly respected professional and you're two losers.
DALE Three losers.
Dale points to the window where Julia sees COCKSUCKER JONES outside holding up a video camera.
He waves to her.
JULIA You little bastard --
DALE Shut up, Julia.
DALE Now, my fiancee and I are going to take a very expensive two week vacation which you're going to pay for.
DALE And then I'm going to come back to a rape- free workplace.
DALE Because if you so much as look at my ass, I'll have yours locked up.
With a bounce in his step, Dale strides out of the room.
There's an awkward beat with Kenny and Julia.
KENNY I don't suppose you could take a look at this molar --
OUT! GET OUT! Kenny scampers out, pulling up his pants as he goes.
Nick is in his new office as a young employee, CARTER, 20's, pops his head in.
CARTER You wanted to see me, Mr. Waters?
NICK Hi, Carter.
NICK Just wanted to check if you had a chance to finish those regional sales projections yet?
CARTER Oh, I think I may need another day.
NICK Okay.
NICK I was hoping to give them to the marketing guys today, but I can hold them off.
In the future, it'd be great if you could tell me if you're going to miss a deadline.
Carter's eyes narrow.
All at once, he rushes at Nick, grabs him by the throat and HURLS him THROUGH THE PLATE GLASS WINDOW, shattering it.
Nick plummets forty feet and lands with a SICKENING CRUNCH directly onto his own car.
Just behind him we see a parking plaque that reads "Nick Waters, Senior VP of Sales."
Carter stands opposite Nick as before.
CARTER Sure.
CARTER No problem, Mr. Waters.
NICK Thanks, buddy.
Nick smiles and closes the door behind Carter.
He settles into his comfy chair and puts his feet up on the desk.
NICK It's good to be the boss.
