THE PERKS OF BEING a WALLFLOWER
Written by
Stephen Chbosky
Final Draft
The titles begin over black.
We hear the sound of an old typewriter.
Someone reaching out to us.
The bell dings, announcing the end of a line, and we see our title...
Music begins, picture fades up, and we are in the city.
Downtown Pittsburgh.
Looking out of the back window like a child in the back of a station wagon.
We see lights on buildings and everything that makes us wonder.
We see the bridge.
And the river below.
And then we enter...
The Tunnel.
We keep moving backwards, watching the lights.
Golden, alive, and hypnotic.
The music carries us as we float out of the tunnel.
Onto another bridge.
And over the highway.
We move into the night sky, back through the trees, through a window, and into...
It is a neat and tidy little room.
Few posters or books.
CHARLIE is 15.
He is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable to everyone but his classmates.
He sits at his desk, writing a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the radio on his cassette boom box.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Dear Friend, I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Please don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am, and I don't want you to do that.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I just need to know that people like you exist.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Like if you met me, you wouldn't think I was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And I wouldn't make you nervous.
Charlie anxiously walks through the hallway of his suburban split level house.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I hope it's okay for me to think that.
CHARLIE (V.O.) You see, I haven't really talked to anyone outside of my family all summer.
Charlie moves to the living room where dad watches a football game.
Mom reads a page turner and sips her white wine.
Charlie waits for them to notice him.
And waits.
And waits.
Charlie sits at his desk, continuing his letter in pencil.
CHARLIE (V.O.) But tomorrow is my first day of high school ever, and I really need to turn things around this year.
CHARLIE (V.O.) So, I have a plan.
We see it in Charlie's mind.
Slow motion and wondrous.
The kids clear out their lockers by throwing their old papers in the air like a New York confetti parade.
CHARLIE (V.O.) As I enter the school for the first time, I will visualize what it will be like on the last day of my senior year.
Charlie walks down the hall.
Triumphant.
Confident.
Happy.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Unfortunately, I counted, and that's...
Reality.
The bell rings, and we see the chaotic maze from Charlie's POV.
A SENIOR BULLY leads the ritual, making dozens of freshmen hop down the hall.
SENIOR BULLY Hop, freshman toads.
SENIOR BULLY Hop!
SENIOR BULLY Move it, boys!
As seniors grab more victims, Charlie moves to the wall.
CHARLIE (V.O.) ...
CHARLIE (V.O.) 1,385 days from now.
VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS pass, wearing their letter jackets.
LINEBACKER Man, you got big.
NOSE TACKLE Worked out all summer.
NOSE TACKLE Rock hard, dude.
At the front of the pack is BRAD HAYS (17), the quarterback.
He's good looking, charismatic, and friendly.
The big man on campus.
Nice guy, too.
BRAD HAYS Would you guys get a room?
They laugh.
Charlie turns to the trophy case to avoid them.
Trying to make himself as small as possible.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Just 1,385 days.
Charlie moves down the lunch line with his sister.
CANDACE KELMECKIS is 17 and a beautiful type A, straight A priss.
CHARLIE (V.O.) In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister Candace and her boyfriend Derek would have let me eat lunch with their earth club.
CANDACE Seniors only.
CANDACE What are you doing with a plastic spork?
Candace turns to her boyfriend, DEREK, 17.
Derek is such a pussy, the most masculine thing about him is his pony-tail.
DEREK I don't want to bring back silverware--
CANDACE Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.
Derek takes the silverware like a beaten dog.
Charlie watches them move into the intimidating cafeteria.
Charlie sits in the corner alone, observing everyone having a great time with their friends.
He sees a pretty girl with blonde hair having the best first day.
This is SUSAN, 14.
CHARLIE (V.O.) When my sister said no, I thought maybe my old friend Susan would want to have lunch with me.
Charlie catches her eye and waves, but she looks away.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) In middle school, Susan was very fun to be around, but now she doesn't like to say hi to me anymore.
Charlie turns his attention to the quarterback, Brad Hays.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And then there's Brad Hays, who's the quarterback of our team.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Before my brother went to play football for Penn State, he and Brad played together.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) So, I thought maybe he'd say hi to me.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) But Brad's a senior, and I'm me, so...
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) who am I kidding?
Brad catches Charlie staring at him.
Awkward.
Charlie sits by himself, watching the freshmen boys laugh as a senior paints a goatee on his face with a grease pencil.
CHARLIE (V.O.) On the bright side, one senior decided to make fun of the teacher instead of the freshmen.
CHARLIE (V.O.) He even drew on Mr. Callahan's legendary goatee with a grease pencil.
Meet PATRICK (18), full of confidence, mischief, and so over high school.
He is the class clown, performing a perfect imitation of the teacher, Mr. Callahan.
PATRICK Boys, the prick punch is not a toy.
PATRICK I learned that in 'Nam back in '68.
PATRICK "Callahan," the sergeant said, "put down that prick punch and go kill some gooks."
The laughter suddenly dies as the real MR.
CALLAHAN (57) walks up behind the oblivious Patrick.
PATRICK (CONT'D) But you know what happened?
PATRICK (CONT'D) That prick punch killed my best friend in a Saigon whorehouse.
Patrick suddenly feels Mr. Callahan behind him.
Oops.
MR. CALLAHAN I heard you were going to be in my class.
MR. CALLAHAN Are you proud being a senior taking freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?
PATRICK My name is Patrick.
PATRICK You call me Patrick or you call me nothing.
MR. CALLAHAN Okay...
MR. CALLAHAN Nothing.
The class laughs.
Except Charlie.
He watches Patrick take the long walk back to his seat.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I felt really bad for Patrick.
CHARLIE (V.O.) He wasn't saying the impersonation to be mean or anything.
CHARLIE (V.O.) He was just trying to make us freshmen feel better.
MR. CALLAHAN Everyone open your safety guides.
MR. CALLAHAN Nothing...
MR. CALLAHAN why don't you read first?
Patrick opens the book.
PATRICK Chapter 1.
PATRICK Surviving your fascist shop teacher, who needs to put kids down to feel big.
PATRICK Oh, wow.
PATRICK This is useful guys.
PATRICK We should read on.
Charlie smiles.
He loves him already.
The kids pass back paperback copies of To Kill A Mockingbird.
Charlie opens his Trapper Keeper, takes a pencil out of the plastic pouch, and writes...
"ENGLISH CLASS...
DAY ONE."
CHARLIE (V.O.) My last class of the day is advanced English, and I'm excited to finally start learning with the smartest kids in the school...
A SMART ASS FRESHMAN girl with braces smiles at him.
SMART ASS FRESHMAN Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.
The kids around him laugh.
Charlie's ears turn red.
At the blackboard, the teacher writes his name...
Mr. Anderson.
But you can call him BILL (27).
Bill is an idealist.
BILL Shhh.
BILL I'm Mr. Anderson.
BILL And thanks to Teach for America, I'm going to be your teacher for freshman English.
BILL This semester, we're going to be learning Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
BILL Genius book.
BILL Now, who wants to get out of the first pop quiz?
All hands go up.
Except Charlie's.
Bill paces the rows.
BILL (CONT'D) I'm shocked.
BILL (CONT'D) Alright.
BILL (CONT'D) You can skip the quiz if you tell me which author invented the paperback book.
BILL (CONT'D) Anyone?
As kids think, Bill confiscates contraband, removes hats.
BILL (CONT'D) He's British.
BILL (CONT'D) He also invented the serial.
BILL (CONT'D) In fact, at the end of chapter 3 of his first novel, he had a man hanging off a cliff by his fingernails.
BILL (CONT'D) Hence, the term cliffhanger.
BILL (CONT'D) Anybody?
FRESHMAN GIRL Shakespeare.
BILL That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare didn't write novels.
BILL Anybody else?
BILL The author was...
Bill is about to give the answer when he notices Charlie has already written...
Charles Dickens.
BILL (CONT'D) ...
BILL (CONT'D) Charles Dickens.
BILL (CONT'D) However, if you and I had gone to a play in Shakespeare's time, it would have cost 4 pennies.
BILL (CONT'D) Can you imagine that?
BILL (CONT'D) We would have put those pennies in a metal box, which the ushers would lock in the office.
BILL (CONT'D) And that's where we get the term...
BILL (CONT'D) anyone?
KIDS "Office Depot!" "Office Supplies!"
Charlie writes down Box Office, then looks up to find that Bill is staring at him.
Waiting for him to raise his hand.
BILL I'll give you a free "A" on anything but the final term paper if you get it right.
Charlie looks down.
He's not going to answer.
BILL (CONT'D) Box office.
The kids groan.
They should have known.
Charlie smiles to himself.
He's going to like this class.
The bell rings.
The students chatter their way out of class.
The last to leave is Charlie.
BILL You should learn to participate.
Charlie stops and turns to find Bill erasing the board.
BILL (CONT'D) Why didn't you raise your hand?
BILL (CONT'D) They call you teacher's pet?
BILL (CONT'D) Freak?
BILL (CONT'D) I used to get spaz.
BILL (CONT'D) I mean, come on, spaz?
Charlie smiles.
Bill takes a moment.
Then...
BILL (CONT'D) So, I heard you had a tough time last year.
BILL (CONT'D) But they say if you make one friend on your first day, you're doing okay.
CHARLIE Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that would be sort of depressing.
BILL Yeah.
BILL I could see that.
CHARLIE Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.
CHARLIE I'm okay.
Bill nods and watches Charlie exit.
He gets swallowed up by the hallway as the bell rings.
Charlie looks through the thick office glass.
He sees Patrick use his charms on MRS.
SMALL, (58) the Principal.
PATRICK I would happily not take shop...
Out of nowhere, the SENIOR BULLY grabs Charlie's book.
SENIOR BULLY Hey, Freshman Toad.
The bully rips the cover.
He throws it on the ground as his friends laugh and disappear down the hall.
Charlie walks up and picks up his book.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Well, I have 1,384 days to go.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And just so I say it to someone, high school is even worse than middle school.
Charlie walks up the path to his house.
CHARLIE (V.O.) If my parents ask me about it, I probably won't tell them the truth because I don't want them to worry that I might get bad again.
Charlie tapes his book cover back together.
He looks up as his dad comes home from a long day.
Charlie's mom hugs him.
CHARLIE (V.O.) If my Aunt Helen were still here, I could talk to her.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And I know she would understand how I am both happy and sad, and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I just hope I make a friend soon.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Love always, Charlie.
Charlie stands in the kitchen, pouring his milk.
MOTHER Charlie, come on.
His family is seated around the table.
Candace's boyfriend, Derek, is their special guest.
DEREK Mmmm.
DEREK This chicken paprikash is delicious, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
Charlie's father rolls his eyes, then reads his sports page.
MOTHER Thank you, Derek.
MOTHER It's Charlie's favorite.
MOTHER He was a little nervous about starting high school, so I made it.
FATHER You feel a little silly being nervous now, huh, champ?
CHARLIE Yes, sir.
CHARLIE I sure do.
Charlie carries his milk back to the table.
He quickly sits, hoping someone will change the subject.
FATHER I told you.
FATHER Just give 'em a smile and be yourself.
FATHER That's how you--
CANDACE "--make friends in the real world."
FATHER You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
DEREK Freshman year is tough, but you really find yourself.
FATHER Thanks, Derek.
Charlie's father and mother watch a local sports show.
Charlie passes by them with ice cream on his way downstairs.
MOTHER I think you could be a little nicer to Derek.
FATHER I'm sorry.
FATHER The kid's a pussy.
FATHER I can't stand him.
Charlie moves to the entry hall.
He looks through the screen door to the porch where Candace kisses Derek's cheek goodbye.
As Derek walks to his mom's Mercedes, Candace joins Charlie.
DEREK I hope you love the mix I made.
DEREK The cover is hand-painted.
When he gets into his car, she hands Charlie the mix tape.
CANDACE Charlie, do you want this?
CHARLIE Are you sure?
CANDACE He gives me one every week.
Charlie sits on his bed, reading To Kill a Mockingbird, the cover taped back together.
We see Derek's mix...
Autumn Leaves...
rotate in his old tape recorder.
DEREK (V.O.) Hey, Babe.
DEREK (V.O.) This next one might be a little sad, but it reminded me of your eyes.
The first notes of The Smiths' "Asleep" begins.
As Morrissey sings, Charlie keeps reading.
And reading.
The reading is done.
Charlie proudly puts To Kill a Mockingbird on his newly dubbed "Shelf of Fame."
The songs continues as we see glimpses of Charlie's day to day life over the next few weeks.
Charlie exits his English class.
FRESHMEN BULLIES wait for him, led by...
SMART ASS FRESHMAN Did you already do the term paper on To
Silence.
They grab and drag him into the boy's room.
We hear the toilet flush for the swirly.
Charlie looks at the new bottle of prescription Wellbutrin.
He puts a pill in his mouth and washes it down with RC cola.
Charlie watches his brother and the Penn State Nittany Lions on TV.
He looks over at his father, but his dad is too busy building Charlie's clock for shop class to notice him.
Charlie carries his tray through the intimidating cafeteria.
Not giving up.
Looking for somewhere to sit.
Charlie sits by himself in the corner.
He looks around the cafeteria, wanting to break in.
Not knowing how.
After a moment, he returns to his book.
The song ends.
Friday Night Football in Western, PA.
Charlie buys his Coke and nachos and wanders to the bleachers.
He sits alone, trying to blend in by cheering with the rest of students.
When the Mill Grove Devils recover a fumble, he hears...
PATRICK Come on Devils!
PATRICK Woooooo!
Charlie looks up at Patrick, cheering his head off.
TWIN SENIOR GIRLS pass him, taunting.
TWIN SENIOR GIRLS Hey, Nothing.
TWIN SENIOR GIRLS Hey, Nothing.
PATRICK Suck it, virginity pledges!
Charlie wants to go up to Patrick so badly.
After driving himself crazy, sitting up and down twice, he approaches.
CHARLIE Hey...
CHARLIE Patrick.
PATRICK Hey!
PATRICK You're in my shop class, right?
PATRICK How's your clock coming?
CHARLIE My dad's building it.
PATRICK Yeah.
PATRICK Mine looks like a boat.
PATRICK You want to sit over here, or are you waiting for your friends?
CHARLIE No.
CHARLIE I'll sit if that's okay.
Patrick motions for Charlie to sit.
Charlie sits.
Elated.
PATRICK Thanks for not calling me "Nothing" by the way.
PATRICK It's an endless nightmare.
PATRICK And these assholes actually think they're being original.
Brad Hays puts on his helmet and rushes onto the field.
Charlie dries his hands on his pants.
So nervous.
A 5 second silence that feels like a year.
Think of something to say.
Anything.
CHARLIE So, uh...
CHARLIE you like football?
PATRICK Love it.
CHARLIE Then, maybe you know my broth--
PATRICK Hey, Sam.
Charlie looks up.
Standing there is the prettiest girl he's ever seen.
SAM (17) would make every mother proud and every father nervous.
She is alive, adventurous, and a world class flirt.
Great attitude.
Great taste.
Great banter.
SAM Question.
SAM Could the bathrooms here be more disgusting?
PATRICK Yes, they call it the men's room.
Sam sits down, sandwiching Charlie between her and Patrick.
Charlie tries to remain casual.
Hang in there, buddy.
SAM Well, I finally got hold of Bob.
PATRICK Party tonight?
SAM No.
SAM He's still trying to shag that waitress from the Olive Garden.
PATRICK He's never tossing that salad.
Brad Hays marches the Devils offense down the field.
The kids clap.
Sam looks at Charlie, then turns back to Patrick.
SAM Patrick...
SAM who's this?
PATRICK This is...
CHARLIE Uh...
CHARLIE Charlie...
CHARLIE Kelmeckis.
PATRICK Kelmeckis!
PATRICK No shit!
PATRICK Your sister dates Pony Tail Derek, doesn't she?
CHARLIE Is that what they call him?
SAM Awww.
SAM Leave Pony Tail Derek alone.
SAM You put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.
PATRICK I try, Sam.
PATRICK I try.
SAM It's nice to meet you, Charlie.
SAM I'm Sam.
Sam extends her hand to Charlie.
Every nail a different color.
They shake.
Then, Sam grabs a nacho.
Zoinks!
PATRICK So, what's the plan, Sam?
PATRICK You want to go to Mary Elizabeth's house?
SAM Can't.
SAM She got caught watering down her parent's brandy with iced tea.
SAM Let's just go to Kings.
PATRICK Hey...
PATRICK we're going to Kings after the game if you want to come.
Charlie nods just as Brad Hays tosses a touchdown pass.
The fans go crazy.
Especially Patrick.
Charlie smiles.
The Devils' faithful cheer as Brad Hays and his guys enter!
The place is packed.
Patrick and Sam drink coffee while Charlie eats his brownie.
They're all excited.
SAM Do you have a favorite band?
CHARLIE I think The Smiths are my favorite.
SAM Are you kidding!?
SAM I love The Smiths!
SAM The best breakup band ever.
SAM What's your favorite song?
CHARLIE Asleep.
CHARLIE It's from Louder Than Bombs.
CHARLIE I heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape.
PATRICK That works on so many levels.
CHARLIE I could make a copy for you.
SAM Thanks.
SAM What about Eide's?
SAM You love Eide's, right?
CHARLIE Yeah.
CHARLIE They're great.
PATRICK Not a band, Charlie.
SAM It's an old record store downtown.
PATRICK I used to be popular before Sam got me some good music.
PATRICK So, watch out, Charlie.
PATRICK She'll ruin your life forever.
CHARLIE That's okay.
Brad Hays, the quarterback, passes with his posse.
Taunting.
NOSE TACKLE & LINEBACKER Hey, Nothing.
NOSE TACKLE & LINEBACKER Hey, Nothing.
PATRICK Let it go!
PATRICK Jesus!
PATRICK It's an old joke!
PATRICK It's over!
Sam laughs.
She loves watching Patrick get riled up.
SAM So, Charlie...
SAM what are you going to do when you get out of here?
CHARLIE My Aunt Helen said I should be a writer, but I don't know what I'd write about.
SAM You could write about us.
PATRICK Yeah.
PATRICK Call it Slut and The Falcon.
PATRICK Make us solve crimes.
Sam laughs.
Charlie smiles.
CHARLIE You guys look happy together.
CHARLIE How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend?
CHARLIE What?
SAM He's my step-brother.
SAM My mom finally left my worthless dad and married his nice dad 3 years ago.
PATRICK But Sam's not bitter.
PATRICK Make no mistake.
SAM Absolutely.
SAM I'm not a bulimic.
SAM I'm a bulim-ist.
They laugh at their inside joke.
Charlie has no idea what's so funny.
CHARLIE I'm sorry.
CHARLIE I don't know what that means.
PATRICK She just really believes in bulimia.
SAM I love bulimia.
Charlie hops out of Sam's old truck.
The music blares.
PATRICK Thanks for paying, Charlie.
CHARLIE No problem.
CHARLIE Thanks for the ride.
CHARLIE Hey...
CHARLIE maybe I'll see you around in school?
SAM God, would you turn that down?
SAM You're going to make us deaf.
SAM Bye, Charlie.
PATRICK Bye, Charlie.
CHARLIE Okay.
CHARLIE Bye.
Charlie waves as the truck leaves.
The look on his face.
The happiness from one night of company.
Charlie enters the house, excited to tell someone his news.
He runs up the stairs to find the living room empty.
He hears the TV playing downstairs in the basement.
As Charlie approaches, he hears muffled sounds of fighting.
DEREK I'm sorry.
DEREK I can't do anything about it.
DEREK Please talk to me.
CANDACE Maybe your mom and I should have a "drive us to our hair appointment" contest.
CANDACE Then, I could spend a Saturday with you.
Charlie looks through a slit in the open door to find...
DEREK There's nothing I can do--
CANDACE Do you always want to be a mama's boy?
DEREK I am not a mama's boy--
CANDACE Yes!
CANDACE You are!
CANDACE Every time I go to your house--
DEREK Shhh.
DEREK Shut u--
CANDACE -- your mom says, "Don't go to Columbia with Candace.
CANDACE Go to Pitt, Derek.
CANDACE Mommy needs you to stay at home because she can't drive herself."
CANDACE She's only 51.
Charlie enters, wanting to stop the fight.
Derek's neck is red.
Dangerous angry.
Candace keeps digging.
CANDACE And you just stand there like a little bitch dog.
SNAP!
Out of nowhere, Derek slaps her across the face.
It's not a movie slap.
It's a real slap.
Dead sound.
And after it, silence.
Candace turns and sees Charlie.
It sobers her up.
Charlie moves at Derek.
Candace stops him.
CANDACE (CONT'D) Charlie, just go.
CANDACE (CONT'D) I can handle it.
CANDACE (CONT'D) Just don't wake up mom and dad.
She pushes him out of the room and closes the door.
Charlie sits at his desk.
So disturbed.
He hears a car start outside.
He moves to his window and looks down at Derek and Candace near Derek's mother's Mercedes.
Derek is crying.
Candace comforts.
After a beat...
they kiss.
Charlie stands frozen, a look creeping across his face.
MOTHER (V.O.) Hey, look who's here...
The door opens to reveal Charlie's mom and AUNT HELEN entering the house.
Aunt Helen carries a suitcase.
The children don't know where she's been or why she looks sad.
They just know they love her.
Little Charlie stands at the top of the stairs with his brother and sister in their Sunday clothes.
There are balloons.
And streamers.
LITTLE CANDACE Welcome home, Aunt Helen!
AUNT HELEN Oh.
AUNT HELEN Look at you all, dressed so nice.
Aunt Helen smiles at Little Charlie on top of the stairs.
Charlie stands at the top of the stairs as Candace enters the house.
She is startled when she sees Charlie.
They whisper.
CHARLIE What are you doing?
CANDACE Look, I egged him on.
CANDACE You saw it.
CANDACE He's never hit me before.
CANDACE I promise he'll never hit me again.
She's about to go back downstairs when...
CHARLIE Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?
A silence passes between them.
Then...
CANDACE Charlie...
CANDACE this is Pony Tail Derek.
CANDACE I can handle him.
CANDACE Will you trust me?
CANDACE Please, don't tell mom and dad.
With a desperately confident nod, Candace goes downstairs.
Charlie stands in the entry hall, troubled.
The Homecoming Dance is in full swing.
God bless everyone.
Especially Charlie.
He's alone at the wall, dressed in his Sunday suit.
To us, adorable.
To himself, in living hell.
Charlie watches his sister, slow dancing with Derek.
As happy as she looks, Charlie still isn't sure if he did the right thing by keeping quiet.
The song ends to applause.
After a beat, Charlie turns away.
That's when he sees Sam and Patrick at the punch bowl.
We hear the first notes of "Come On, Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners.
SAM Oh, my God.
SAM They're playing good music.
PATRICK Holy shit.
PATRICK They are!
PATRICK They're playing good music!
SAM Living room routine?
PATRICK Living room routine!
Charlie watches Sam and Patrick run to the center of the floor and show this stiff crowd what dancing is.
It starts slow.
"So over it" hand moves.
A little shoulder.
And then, the best of swing.
30 seconds of genius.
Charlie takes a breath.
Then, he tries desperately not to look like he's dancing toward them as he dances toward them.
He bobs his head like a dork.
And once he gets close, Patrick and Sam turn and find him.
SAM & PATRICK Hey!
Without a pause, they grab his hands, and move together in a circle.
Their own island.
After a moment, Sam moves around Charlie like a maypole as the whole gym explodes into dance.
The party rages inside this mansion in the rich part of town.
Patrick and Sam walk up the steps with Charlie tailing.
SAM God, it's freezing.
PATRICK But you wore that toasty costume.
PATRICK It's not like you're trying too hard to be original.
SAM Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.
CHARLIE Are you sure it's okay that I come?
SAM Of course.
SAM Just remember, Charlie...
SAM Bob's not paranoid.
PATRICK "He's sensitive."
Sam knocks.
The door opens, revealing BOB (20).
Bob was the cool high school kid, who never quite left.
He's stoned so often that people can't tell the difference anymore.
BOB Sam...
BOB that waitress from the Olive Garden is a tease.
BOB Will you marry me?
SAM Only if I have Patrick's blessing.
BOB Patrick?
PATRICK You're a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute.
PATRICK So, I'm going to have to say "no" on that one, but nice try.
PATRICK Charlie?
Patrick leads Charlie inside, leaving Bob staring at Sam.
BOB Touche.
PATRICK Charlie...
PATRICK this is a party.
The music blasts.
Charlie's eyes are our guide.
As they walk through the crowd, you can smell it.
Stale beer and cigarette smoke.
High school parties.
The room is packed
with kids playing quarters.
Others pouring vodka into a watermelon.
PATRICK (CONT'D) This is what fun looks like.
Patrick smiles when he spots two friends.
PATRICK (CONT'D) You ready to meet some desperate women?
MARY ELIZABETH and ALICE (both 17) sit on the sofa together.
Mary Elizabeth is smart, a little overweight, and extremely bossy.
Alice will figure out that she's a lesbian in college.
Right now, she just likes movies and is Mary Elizabeth's "beta female."
PATRICK (CONT'D) Here, have a seat.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Hey, ladies, meet Charlie.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Charlie, meet ladies.
They shake hands and say their hellos.
PATRICK (CONT'D) This is Charlie's first party ever.
PATRICK (CONT'D) So, I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blow jobs from both of you.
MARY ELIZABETH Patrick, you're such a dick.
PATRICK Where the hell did you go?
MARY ELIZABETH The dance was a little boring, don't you think?
PATRICK You're so selfish.
PATRICK We looked everywhere for you.
PATRICK You could have told someone.
MARY ELIZABETH Cry me a river.
PATRICK How is it that you got meaner since
MARY ELIZABETH Just lucky I guess.
PATRICK I think you're doing something wrong.
MARY ELIZABETH Or something very right.
Patrick and Mary Elizabeth laugh at their banter, just as Sam calls out from the other side of the room.
SAM Hey!
SAM Look who's here!
The party turns, and Charlie sees Brad Hays, the quarterback, enter with Sam and Bob.
Patrick approaches them.
Charlie sits on the beat up couch next to the girls.
He's shocked.
CHARLIE Is that Brad Hays?
ALICE Yeah.
ALICE He comes here sometimes.
CHARLIE But he's a popular kid.
MARY ELIZABETH Then, what are we?
Charlie tries to think of something, but he can't.
The girls turn, ignoring him.
Bob approaches with a tray.
BOB Charlie, you look like you could use a brownie.
CHARLIE Thank you.
CHARLIE I was so hungry at the dance.
CHARLIE I was going to go to King's, but I didn't really have any time.
CHARLIE Thanks.
Bob smiles.
Mary Elizabeth gives Alice a knowing glance.
Charlie bites into the brownie.
The icing gushing between his teeth.
The image goes up into the smoke like an inhale as he chews and chews and chews.
After a beat, the music changes, and the image exhales back down to Charlie, who is now...
baked out of his mind.
The
whole party surrounds him now, pissing themselves with laughter as this shy kid talks and talks and talks.
CHARLIE Have you guys felt this carpet?
CHARLIE This carpet feels so darn good.
MARY ELIZABETH Charlie, what do you think about high school?
CHARLIE High school?
CHARLIE Bullshit.
CHARLIE The cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center.
CHARLIE And people wear their letter jackets even when it's 98 degrees out.
CHARLIE And why do they give out letters for marching band?
CHARLIE That's not a sport, and we all know it.
MARY ELIZABETH This kid is crazy.
Charlie looks at Mary Elizabeth with her new wave haircut.
CHARLIE And Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really going to regret that haircut when you look back at old photographs.
CHARLIE I'm really sorry.
CHARLIE That sounded like a compliment in my head.
MARY ELIZABETH Oh, my God!
ALICE Well, it's kind of true.
MARY ELIZABETH Shut up!
Sam enters the room.
Takes quick stock.
Then...
SAM Bob, did you get him stoned?
BOB Come on, Sam.
BOB He likes it.
BOB Just look at him.
SAM How do you feel, Charlie?
CHARLIE I just really want a milkshake.
The entire room explodes with laughter.
Charlie loves that people find him so funny.
Sam takes the ice cream from the freezer to the blender.
Charlie watches her make the perfect vanilla milkshake.
CHARLIE Sam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the kind of pretty that deserves to make a big deal about itself.
CHARLIE You know what I mean?
SAM Okay, Charlie.
SAM Let me make the milkshake.
CHARLIE What a great word.
CHARLIE Milkshake.
CHARLIE It's like when you say your name over and over again in the mirror, and after awhile, it sounds crazy.
SAM I'm guessing you've never been high before?
CHARLIE Me?
CHARLIE No.
CHARLIE My best friend Michael.
CHARLIE His dad was a big drinker.
CHARLIE So, he hated all that stuff.
CHARLIE Parties, too.
SAM Well, where is Michael tonight?
CHARLIE Oh, he shot himself last May.
Sam looks up.
Shocked silent.
Charlie is just stoned.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I kind of wish he'd left a note.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) You know what I mean?
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Where's the bathroom?
SAM It's up the stairs.
Charlie wanders off.
Sam watches him go.
Charlie leaves the bathroom and stops when he sees himself in a large ornate mirror in the hallway.
CHARLIE Charlie.
CHARLIE Charlie.
CHARLIE Weird.
Charlie wanders down the hallway, a little lost.
He finds the door to the master bedroom and opens it.
He sees Patrick and Brad Hays...
kissing.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Woah.
PATRICK Charlie?
BRAD HAYS Who is that kid?
PATRICK Relax.
PATRICK Relax.
PATRICK He's a friend of mine.
PATRICK Stay here.
Patrick closes the bedroom door and follows Charlie.
CHARLIE I didn't see anything.
PATRICK I know you saw something, but it's okay.
Patrick takes a quick peek to make sure no one is watching.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Listen, Brad doesn't want anyone to know...
PATRICK (CONT'D) wait, are you baked?
CHARLIE "Like a cake."
CHARLIE That's what Bob said.
CHARLIE And how you can't have 3 on a match because they would find us.
CHARLIE And everyone laughed, but I don't know what's funny.
PATRICK Okay, Charlie, listen.
PATRICK I need you to promise that you're not going to say anything to anyone about me and Brad.
PATRICK This has to be our little secret.
CHARLIE Our little secret.
CHARLIE Agreed.
PATRICK Thank you.
PATRICK We'll talk later.
CHARLIE I look forward to that big talk.
Patrick laughs, goes back to the room, and closes the door.
The party has thinned.
Sam watches Charlie drink his milkshake obsessively with Alice and Mary Elizabeth.
CHARLIE Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice?
CHARLIE It's even better than the first one.
Patrick walks downstairs.
Sam motions him over.
SAM I need to talk to you.
SAM Charlie just told me that his best friend shot himself.
SAM I don't think he has any friends.
Patrick turns to look at Charlie.
He feels so bad for the kid.
Patrick raises his plastic cup to the remaining crowd.
PATRICK Everyone.
PATRICK Raise your glasses to Charlie.
Charlie looks up.
A little paranoid.
Everyone is staring.
CHARLIE What did I do?
PATRICK You didn't do anything.
PATRICK We just want to toast our new friend.
PATRICK You see things.
PATRICK And you understand.
PATRICK You're a wallflower.
Charlie dries his sweaty hands on his pants.
He looks around the room at the nods and friendly faces.
PATRICK (CONT'D) What is it?
PATRICK (CONT'D) What's wrong?
PATRICK Well, we didn't think there were any cool people left to meet.
PATRICK So, everyone...
SAM & EVERYONE To Charlie.
They all drink.
Sam approaches him.
A knowing smile.
SAM Welcome to the island of misfit toys.
Charlie smiles, and the soundtrack comes rushing up loud.
The truck speeds on Highway 376 toward the Fort Pitt Tunnel.
Patrick drives.
Sam cranks the radio, blaring "The Tunnel Song."
The Star's anthem, "Your Ex-Lover is Dead" is our prototype for tone.
SAM My God.
SAM What is this song!?
PATRICK Right?
PATRICK I have no idea.
SAM Have you heard it before?
CHARLIE Never.
SAM Wait!
SAM Let's go through the tunnel!
PATRICK Sam, it's freezing.
SAM Patrick, it's the perfect song!
PATRICK No.
PATRICK Mama Patrick says no.
SAM Patrick, it's Sam.
SAM It's Sam talking to you, I'm begging you to drive me--
PATRICK Alright!
PATRICK I concede!
Sam climbs through the window to the flat bed.
She grips the flood lights to steady herself as she stands.
CHARLIE What is she doing?
PATRICK Don't worry.
PATRICK She does it all the time.
SAM Turn it up!
PATRICK You got it, your highness.
Patrick turns up the volume and drums on the steering wheel, just as the truck flies into...
We go behind the truck.
Rising as Sam puts her arms in the air.
The image moves to Charlie's point of view, rising from Sam's feet up her shivering legs.
Past the band-aid on her right knee.
To Sam's face as she looks down.
Into the camera.
Right at us.
For we are now...
Charlie, looking up at Sam, so in love with this free-spirit.
So happy to have friends.
Happy to be alive.
Charlie gets this look on his face.
Patrick notices and smiles.
PATRICK (CONT'D) What?
CHARLIE I feel infinite.
The truck flies out of the Fort Pitt Tunnel onto the bridge.
Patrick and Charlie laugh as Sam raises her arms.
Free and young and alive on the greatest night of Charlie's life.
We see Charlie proudly put a Smiths poster on his wall next to photos of his new friends.
He dances to his desk, listening to Air Supply's "All Out of Love" on his Walkman.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Dear Friend, I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but I've been trying hard not to be a loser.
As the lyrics begin, Charlie unabashedly lip-synchs...
AIR SUPPLY I'm lying alone with my head on the phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts.
Charlie sits at his desk, writing and lip-synching.
CHARLIE (V.O.) For example, I am trying to participate by listening to Sam's collection of big rock ballads and thinking about love.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Sam says they are kitschy and brilliant.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I completely agree.
As the students file out, Charlie hands his paper to Bill in exchange for a beat up copy of The Great Gatsby.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I am also studying extra books outside of class.
CHARLIE (V.O.) As it turns out, Mr. Anderson is a writer.
CHARLIE (V.O.) He even had a play put up in New York once, which I think is very impressive.
CHARLIE (V.O.) He and his wife might go back there after this year.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I know this is selfish, but I really hope he doesn't.
Charlie pauses in the doorway and turns back to look at Bill.
Charlie turns from the lunch line with The Great Gatsby on his tray.
He looks at the gang at their table.
He sits with them as they debate the design of this month's fanzine.
CHARLIE (V.O.) My favorite time, though, is lunch because I get to see Sam and Patrick.
CHARLIE (V.O.) We spend the time working on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine about music and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
CHARLIE (V.O.) It's called Punk Rocky.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Mary Elizabeth is really interesting because she is a Buddhist and a punk, but somehow she always acts like my father at the end of a "long day."
The xerox spits out copies of PUNK ROCKY!
Halloween Issue!
Alice staples while Mary Elizabeth works her like a sled dog.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Her best friend Alice loves vampires and wants to go to film school.
CHARLIE (V.O.) She also steals jeans from the mall.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I don't know why because her family is rich, but I'm trying not to be judgemental.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Especially since I know how they were all there for Patrick last year.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Patrick never likes to be serious, so it took me awhile to get what happened.
Sam and Alice laugh when Patrick begins stapling Mary Elizabeth's fanzines to within an inch of their life.
[Note: The following sequence will come from Charlie's POV of Patrick and Brad's activities over a weekend.]
Brad Hays leads the football team through the banner onto the field as Charlie, Patrick, and Sam cheer.
Moments later, Brad pulls his helmet on and rushes onto the field.
CHARLIE When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret.
CHARLIE I guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around.
Patrick whispers while the gang studies their SAT books.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Then, Monday in school, Brad would say, "Man, I was so wasted.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I don't remember a thing."
CHARLIE (V.O.) This went on for 7 months.
Charlie sits with his family in itchy church clothes.
He turns to see Brad with his father and mother.
Proper family.
Brad's dad gives him a pat on the back.
CHARLIE (V.O.) When they finally did it, Brad said he loved Patrick.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Then, he started to cry.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) saying his dad would kill him.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And saying he was going to hell.
We see Patrick and Brad walking in the library.
They reach the stacks, and just when it looks like they'll speak, they simply...
PASS EACH OTHER WITHOUT A WORD.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Patrick was eventually able to help Brad get sober.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I asked Patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret, and he said no because at least now, Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him.
Brad sits down with his football pals.
Patrick joins Charlie and Sam at their table.
Charlie looks over at Sam, studying hard for her SAT's.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I think that I understand because I really like Sam.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I asked my sister about her, and she said that when Sam was a freshman, the upper classmen used to get her drunk at parties.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I guess she had a reputation.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) But I don't care.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I'd hate for her to judge me based on what I used to be like.
We see Charlie making a mix tape on his boom box.
CHARLIE (V.O.) So, I've been making her a mix tape so she will know how I feel.
The two cassettes run.
The song is just about to finish when...
the side runs out of tape and snaps off.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Ah, shit!
The marquee announces it's time for the...
...
Rocky Horror Picture Show!
The ROCKY EMCEE, dressed as Riff Raff, whips the crowd into a frenzy.
Gimme an R!
Gimme an O!
R-O-C-K-Y!
Rocky!
Rocky!
Gimme a C!
Gimme a K!
Gimme Rocky!
a Y!
What's that spell!?
The crowd cheers!
Charlie claps from the front row.
The movie is in full swing.
Charlie watches Sam as Janet in the Floor Show.
Sam mimics Susan Sarandon perfectly.
Especially the body.
She winks at Charlie as "Fanfare/Don't Dream It" begins and arriving regally as Frank 'n Furter in full drag is...
Patrick.
PATRICK Whatever happened to Fae Wray?
PATRICK That delicate, satin draped frame?
PATRICK As it clung to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same.
Patrick is a rock star.
He approaches Charlie.
Putting his ass in his face.
Charlie is freaked out and laughing!
Especially when he sees Brad, alone in the back, smiling.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Give yourself over to absolute pleasure.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Erotic nightmares beyond any measure.
PATRICK (CONT'D) And sensual daydreams to treasure forever.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Can't you just see it?
PATRICK (CONT'D) Woah oh oh!
Charlie stops laughing when the orgy begins between Patrick, Mary Elizabeth (as Columbia), CRAIG (21), an art student with a model's body (as Rocky)...
and of course...
Sam.
Charlie watches Sam until he can't take his lust (or guilt).
We hear the chorus of "Don't Dream It, Be It" as Charlie watches all of the exciting cast members at the after-show party.
Charlie sees a photo of Sam's naked back on the wall of Craig's loft.
Very arty.
Very black & white.
Charlie's lust (and guilt) are now at 11.
Alice looks at the photo.
ALICE It's gorgeous, Craig.
ALICE What did you use?
Craig is impressive to high school kids.
He's a little pretentious.
But his art school life.
His red wine.
His loft.
Wow.
Right now, he holds court in the wine line.
CRAIG Color film, but black and white paper for the printing.
CRAIG My professor gave me an "A," but for the wrong reasons.
CRAIG Most of them are idiots.
CRAIG You'll see what I mean when you get to college.
CRAIG How were your SAT's by the way?
ALICE 1150.
ALICE I think I'll get into NYU.
CRAIG Yeah, I hope so.
MARY ELIZABETH 1490.
MARY ELIZABETH Harvard.
MARY ELIZABETH Face!
Charlie sees Sam alone on the loft steps.
She looks a little down.
He hands Sam a plastic cup and sits next to her.
CHARLIE Hey.
CHARLIE Are you okay?
SAM Yeah.
SAM Yeah.
SAM But I got my SAT results back.
SAM Oops.
CHARLIE You can take them again.
SAM Yeah, it's just if I'm going to Penn State main campus, I have to do much better.
SAM I wish I would have studied freshman year.
SAM I was a bit of a mess.
CHARLIE I'll help you study for the next one.
SAM Will you?
CHARLIE Yeah, of course.
SAM Thanks, Charlie.
Charlie summons his courage.
He hands her the mix tape.
SAM (CONT'D) What's this?
CHARLIE Just a mix tape.
CHARLIE No big deal.
CHARLIE My parents have a pretty good stereo.
CHARLIE It's all about that night in the tunnel.
CHARLIE I couldn't find that song we were listening to, but I'm still searching for it, so--
SAM It's okay.
SAM These are great.
SAM You have really good taste, Charlie.
CHARLIE Really?
SAM Yeah.
SAM Way better than me as a freshman.
SAM I used to listen to the worst top 40.
CHARLIE No.
SAM Yeah, I did.
SAM But then I heard this old song.
SAM Pearly Dew Drops Drop.
SAM And I thought someday I would be at a party in college or something.
SAM And I'd look up and see this person across the room.
SAM And from that moment, I'd know everything was going to be okay.
SAM You know what I mean?
CHARLIE Yeah.
The tape revolves in the stereo, playing a beautiful ballad.
Charlie watches Sam sway to his music like a serenade.
Like she is dancing with him.
But she isn't.
A wider angle reveals that she is slow dancing with...
Craig.
Charlie is 15 year old CRUSHED.
No filter.
Just feeling.
Patrick, Alice, and Mary Elizabeth watch Sam across the room.
ALICE So, what do you think?
PATRICK I don't know.
ALICE I hope it works out.
ALICE Craig would be a big step up from her last boyfriend.
MARY ELIZABETH No, shit.
MARY ELIZABETH Who could forget Mr. Car Wash Loser?
PATRICK I just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys.
PATRICK I keep telling her...
PATRICK don't make yourself small.
PATRICK You can't save anybody.
Craig dips a smiling Sam as the song ends.
Sam goes into the kitchen.
Craig approaches Charlie.
Turns off his mix tape.
CRAIG Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid.
CRAIG How about something a little more upbeat?
Craig grabs a record from the pile and slaps it down.
CRAIG (CONT'D) Sam tells me you want to be a writer.
CHARLIE Yeah.
ALICE Don't you write poetry, Craig?
CRAIG No.
CRAIG Poetry writes me.
CRAIG You know?
Charlie sighs.
Craig's upbeat song begins to play.
He dances over to Sam.
Charlie's heart breaks as he watches Sam hug on Craig.
In a mirror image, Candace hugs on Derek near the lockers.
Charlie closes his own locker and moves down the hall.
The bell rings.
Charlie sets down his On the Road paper.
BILL Wow.
BILL That was fast.
BILL You want another one?
Charlie nods.
Bill smiles and reaches into his desk.
He hands Charlie a copy of A Separate Piece.
Charlie takes the book and starts to walk out, but he turns back.
CHARLIE Mr. Anderson...
CHARLIE can I ask you something?
BILL Yeah.
CHARLIE Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date?
BILL Are we talking about anyone specific?
Charlie nods.
Bill looks straight at him.
Not preaching.
Coming from a history of personal experience and pain.
BILL (CONT'D) We accept the love we think we deserve.
CHARLIE Can we make them know they deserve more?
BILL We can try.
Charlie smiles.
Charlie waits nervously at a booth.
He sees Sam enter.
He fixes his hair, then pretends to read his SAT PREP BOOK.
SAM Hey, Charlie.
CHARLIE Hey, Sam.
CHARLIE I didn't see you come in.
CHARLIE You want to work on probabilities and statistics?
Sam nods.
They open their books, and a Christmas song begins.
In a quick passage of time, we see them study next to Halloween decorations.
Then, Thanksgiving.
And finally, Christmas decorations.
The song continues.
Charlie's mom and sister hang the Christmas ornaments as Charlie helps his dad find that "one
CHARLIE Hey, dad.
CHARLIE Can I have 30 dollars?
FATHER 20 dollars?
FATHER What do you want 10 dollars for?
CHARLIE Sam is doing secret santa.
CHARLIE It's her favorite thing in the world.
CHARLIE Please.
Charlie's father reaches into his pocket and hands Charlie a bill.
It's a fifty.
Dad winks, in a great mood.
FATHER Have fun.
CHARLIE Thanks.
Lockers are opened by Charlie.
Sam.
Patrick.
Wrapped gifts are deposited.
Mischief smiles.
Lockers closed.
Everyone loves getting their presents except Charlie - who got socks.
Bill hands Charlie a well worn copy of The Catcher in the Rye.
He smiles.
BILL Charlie...
BILL this was my favorite book growing up.
BILL This is my copy, but I want you to have it.
CHARLIE Thanks.
BILL Have a great Christmas break.
CHARLIE You too, Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Callahan, the shop teacher, looks at a Sad Sack Girl's clock.
He takes a moment, and then...
MR. CALLAHAN Terrible stain.
He moves to Charlie's dad's amazing clock.
He hands Charlie an A on a piece of paper.
MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D) That's pretty good, Charlie.
Mr. Callahan moves to Patrick's SHITTY WOODEN CLOCK.
No stain.
No finish.
Lop-sided.
The ugliest clock you've ever seen in your life.
MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D) You've got to be kidding me.
PATRICK If you fail me, you get me next semester.
Mr. Callahan writes a grade and slaps it down.
The song continues as Patrick holds up the grade.
C minus!
Charlie and Sam cheer as Patrick screams at the top of his lungs...
PATRICK Woo!
PATRICK C Minus!
PATRICK It's over!
PATRICK It's over!
PATRICK Ladies and gentlemen, I am below average!
SAM Below average!
Patrick screams at the city in the distance.
Below average!
We move to find Sam, holding her SAT score up to the group.
SAM Hey, guys.
SAM 1210.
Everyone cheers.
Sam hugs Charlie.
Charlie carries Sam on his shoulders past the Christmas Tree.
Sam wears a Santa Hat like a hot elf.
SAM No more applications!
SAM No more SAT's!
SAM Thank you, Charlie!
They pass Mary Elizabeth as she opens her final present.
MARY ELIZABETH Multiple pairs of blue jeans.
MARY ELIZABETH Wow.
MARY ELIZABETH This is a really tough one, but I'm going to have to guess...
MARY ELIZABETH Alice.
Alice smiles.
Bob nudges her.
Guilty as charged.
Mary Elizabeth pulls one last item out of the gift bag.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Wait, guys...
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) a receipt!
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) She actually paid!
PATRICK Impossible!
MARY ELIZABETH I'm so touched.
Alice laughs.
Patrick pours everyone brandy.
The kids look ridiculous, but they don't feel ridiculous.
CHARLIE Where's Craig?
SAM He went home to Connecticut.
SAM He'll be back for New Year's Eve.
CHARLIE I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.
Sam nods, then turns.
Charlie is delighted.
No Craig.
The kids settle in the living room in front of the fire.
SAM Alright, big brother by 3 weeks.
SAM Who's your secret santa?
PATRICK I'll tell you, Sam.
PATRICK This one's tough.
PATRICK I have received a harmonica, a magnetic poetry set, a book about Harvey Milk, and a mix with the song "Asleep" on it...
PATRICK twice.
Charlie starts snickering.
He can't help himself.
PATRICK (CONT'D) I mean, I have no idea.
PATRICK (CONT'D) This collection of presents is so gay that I think I must have given them to myself.
PATRICK (CONT'D) But despite that distinct possibility, I'm going to have to go with...
PATRICK (CONT'D) drum roll...
PATRICK (CONT'D) Charlie.
Charlie holds up his hands.
Yay!
They all cheer.
SAM Alright, Charlie...
SAM it's your turn.
Charlie and Patrick switch places.
Charlie stands.
CHARLIE Okay.
CHARLIE Uh, I have received socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt.
CHARLIE I was ordered to wear them all tonight.
CHARLIE So, I'm guessing my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth.
PATRICK Huh.
PATRICK Now, why do you say that?
CHARLIE I don't know.
CHARLIE She bosses people around sometimes.
The gang cracks up.
Mary Elizabeth is pissed.
MARY ELIZABETH What the hell is wrong with you?
CHARLIE Sorry.
PATRICK Well, you'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually...
PATRICK me.
CHARLIE You got me clothes?
CHARLIE Why?
PATRICK Because all the great writers used to wear great suits.
PATRICK Your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom.
PATRICK Delve into our facilities.
PATRICK Emerge a star.
Charlie gives Sam a sack of presents.
CHARLIE Can you hand these out while I'm gone?
MARY ELIZABETH Wait a second.
MARY ELIZABETH There's only secret santa presents.
MARY ELIZABETH There are rules, Charlie.
PATRICK Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat Christmas?
PATRICK Hand them out, Sam.
Sam gives out the presents.
The group rips them open.
Alice looks at a book about Martin Scorsese with the inscription...
ALICE "Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."
Alice turns to Mary Elizabeth who holds up a card with...
MARY ELIZABETH 40 dollars.
MARY ELIZABETH "To print Punk Rocky in color next time."
Bob blows soap bubbles into the air.
Stoned.
Mesmerized.
BOB He knows me.
BOB He really knows me.
Sam looks at her present.
An old 45 record of The Beatles classic "Something" with a card.
She reads the card.
Holds it to her chest.
Very moved.
SAM Come on out, Charlie.
They all chime in.
"Let's go, young man!" "Charlie!
Charlie!" Charlie opens the door off camera, and we see his entrance play off their faces.
The reverse angle reveals...
Charlie dressed in his suit.
Like the best of English mods in the 60's.
For those of you who know the book, this is the cover.
They all clap.
It's magic.
PATRICK Yeah!
PATRICK What a display of man I have ever seen!
Sam and Charlie look at each and smile.
The door opens.
Sam and Charlie walk into the dark room.
CHARLIE Where are we going?
SAM It's a surprise.
Sam flips the switch, bathing the room in light.
Sam's room is so cool.
A shrine to music.
A xerox that says "The Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves."
Virgin Mary icons.
Snow globes.
Kitsch.
CHARLIE Is this your room?
CHARLIE It's so cool.
SAM Thanks.
Sam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk.
CHARLIE You got me a present?
SAM With all that help on my Penn State application?
SAM Of course I did.
SAM Open it.
Charlie lifts up the box to reveal an OLD MANUAL TYPEWRITER.
CHARLIE I don't know what to say.
SAM You don't have to say anything.
Sam goes over and types.
"Write about us sometime."
He smiles and types back.
"I will."
They look at each other.
We can hear a lovely ballad playing downstairs.
SAM (CONT'D) I'm sorry we can't be here for your birthday.
CHARLIE That's okay.
CHARLIE I'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad.
SAM I'm in such a great mood, I don't think even he could ruin it.
SAM I feel like I'm finally doing good.
CHARLIE You are.
SAM Me?
SAM What about you?
SAM When I met you, you were this scared freshman.
SAM And look at you in that suit.
SAM You're like a sexy English school boy.
SAM I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out.
CHARLIE No.
SAM Innocent.
SAM Worst kind of guys.
SAM Never see you coming.
SAM And parents love you.
SAM That's like...
SAM extra danger.
CHARLIE Well, it hasn't worked so far.
SAM Come on.
SAM You've never had a girlfriend?
SAM Not even a 2nd grade valentine?
He shakes his head.
SAM (CONT'D) Have you ever kissed a girl?
CHARLIE No.
CHARLIE What about you?
SAM Have I ever kissed a girl?
CHARLIE No!
CHARLIE Your first kiss...
Sam gets this strange look in her eyes.
A little haunted.
SAM My first kiss?
SAM I was 11.
SAM His name was Robert.
SAM He would come over to the house all the time.
CHARLIE Was he your first boyfriend?
SAM He was my dad's boss.
Charlie goes silent.
SAM (CONT'D) You know Charlie, I used to sleep with guys who treated me like shit.
SAM (CONT'D) And get wasted all the time.
SAM (CONT'D) But now...
SAM (CONT'D) I feel like I have a chance.
SAM (CONT'D) I could even get into a real college.
CHARLIE It's true.
CHARLIE You can do it.
CHARLIE My Aunt...
CHARLIE she had that same thing done to her, too.
CHARLIE And she turned her life around.
SAM She must have been great.
CHARLIE She was my favorite person in the world...
CHARLIE until now.
Sam smiles.
She's very moved.
SAM Charlie, I know that you know I like Craig.
SAM But I want to forget that for a minute.
SAM Okay?
SAM I just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you loves you.
SAM Okay?
Charlie nods.
And with that, Sam leans over and kisses him.
It starts softly, then Sam wraps her thin arms around him.
Holding on for lonely life.
When the song crescendos, and they part, Charlie and Sam look at each other.
Finally...
SAM (CONT'D) I love you, Charlie.
CHARLIE I love you, too.
The porch lights are as golden as Charlie feels right now.
We see the girls wave to each other and hug Sam.
GANG "Merry Christmas!" "Good luck at your dad's!" "See you at New Year's!"
Patrick approaches Charlie in the doorway.
CHARLIE Have a good time at your mom's.
PATRICK Thanks.
PATRICK And Charlie...
PATRICK since you were born on Christmas Eve, I figure you don't get a lot of birthday presents.
PATRICK So, I thought you should have my clock.
PATRICK From the heart.
CHARLIE Thank you, Patrick.
Sam gives Charlie one last hug.
Patrick and Sam watch their friends leave.
PATRICK I love you guys!
We fly as high as Charlie feels.
Above the city on Christmas Eve.
The front door opens, revealing Charlie's dad.
FATHER Hey!
FATHER Look who's here!
He moves out of the way, and standing there is Charlie's older brother, CHRIS KELMECKIS (19).
Chris is handsome, charismatic, and an all around winner.
CHRIS Come here, little sister.
CANDACE Hey, Chris.
Big hug.
Chris smiles big and "son flirts" with his mom.
CHRIS Ma, you look so thin!
MOTHER 10 pounds...
MOTHER Weight Watchers.
Big kiss.
When he lets go, he sees Charlie and smiles.
CHRIS Charlie...
Chris and Charlie look at each other in silence.
Then, hug.
As the family moves into the dining room to celebrate, Chris gives him a quiet...
CHRIS (CONT'D) Happy birthday.
MOTHER Make a wish, honey.
We move closer to Charlie as he makes his wish and blows out his 16 candles.
The wind blows out a candle in one of the luminaria bags.
The suburb is quiet.
Not a creature is stirring.
Except...
Charlie.
He fills a brown paper bag with sand and a candle.
He lights the candle, making the bag glow like a beautiful lantern.
He looks down his street, where families are out with their kids, doing the same luminaria ritual.
The same street.
Christmas Eve.
Many years ago.
Aunt Helen and the kids finish their luminaria bags.
Aunt Helen lights up the candles.
They glow.
AUNT HELEN Can you see it, Charlie?
AUNT HELEN The luminaria is a landing strip for Santa Claus.
The image goes wide.
All of these bags glowing.
Beautiful.
Aunt Helen rattles her keys.
Whispers.
AUNT HELEN (CONT'D) Keep an eye out for him with your brother and sister.
AUNT HELEN (CONT'D) I'll be right back.
She bends down and whispers into his ear.
AUNT HELEN (CONT'D) I'm going to get your birthday present.
She musses his hair and gets in the car.
Charlie hovers over the glowing luminaria.
Something is bothering him.
He shakes it off.
Charlie wanders through the quiet house.
He turns the corner where he finds Chris sitting at the table.
He's lit by a couple of candles and the blinking lights of the Christmas Tree.
He's surrounded by leftovers.
Charlie sits.
CHARLIE Hey.
Chris chews and swallows.
Famished.
They both whisper.
CHRIS Hey.
CHRIS God, I missed mom's cooking.
CHRIS You have no idea how good you have it.
CHRIS I'm actually beginning to hate pizza.
Charlie smiles.
Grabs a Hershey Kiss cookie.
CHARLIE How are you liking school?
CHRIS Not bad.
CHRIS I'm no brainiac like you or Candace.
CHRIS But I'm doing okay.
CHARLIE Okay?
CHARLIE You're playing in a Bowl Game.
Chris laughs.
Charlie smiles.
A moment passes.
Chris changes his tone.
Cautious.
CHRIS How are you feeling, Charlie?
CHARLIE Good.
CHRIS You know what I mean.
CHRIS Is it bad tonight?
CHARLIE No.
CHRIS No?
CHARLIE I'm not picturing things anymore.
CHARLIE And when I do, I can just shut it off.
CHRIS (CONT'D) now.
CHRIS (CONT'D) And maybe if it does get bad again, you can just talk to them, yeah?
CHARLIE Yeah.
CHARLIE Especially Sam.
CHARLIE I'm going to ask her out at New Years.
CHARLIE I think the time is right now.
Chris smiles at his kid brother.
We hear the church organ.
The family moves down the line to receive Holy Communion at Christmas Mass.
Charlie's father, then mother, then sister, take the sacrament.
Charlie is next.
The PRIEST makes the motion of the cross with the communion wafer.
He places it in Charlie's hand.
Charlie brings the sacrament to his mouth with his fingers...
We move in closer to Charlie's fingers in his mouth.
When he takes his hand out, we see...
a tab of LSD.
The church organ is now a rock organ.
And it's now...
New Year's Eve.
Charlie closes his mouth.
He looks down the hall of the smoky room where Craig has his arm around Sam.
Charlie turns to Mary Elizabeth, who's also dosed.
CHARLIE How long does this take to work?
About 45 minutes.
The sound is muted thick.
Slight echoes.
Charlie shovels the snow.
Crunch.
Fascinated by his breath making fog.
Sam comes outside.
She's worried about him.
SAM Shoveling snow, huh?
CHARLIE I have to get this driveway clean.
CHARLIE Then, I have to congratulate you for being happy because you deserve it.
SAM You said that an hour ago.
CHARLIE Was that tonight?
CHARLIE God.
CHARLIE I was looking at this tree, but it was a dragon, and then
SAM Okay, Charlie.
SAM Don't freak out.
SAM Just give me the shovel.
SAM Calm down.
SAM Look up.
She points.
Charlie looks up.
Sees the stars.
SAM (CONT'D) Isn't it quiet?
CHARLIE Sam, you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you?
SAM All the time.
SAM So, you want to put on these glasses?
SAM They'll protect you.
Sam puts her arm around his shoulder.
Protecting him.
Charlie looks through the glasses.
The sky bends like a globe.
When he breathes, the sky ripples.
Charlie wanders through the party, tripping out of his mind.
He sits down on the sofa.
The world unbends as Charlie takes off the glasses.
Kids walk around the party, leaving ghosts of themselves behind.
Charlie looks upstairs to find...
Sam and Craig kissing.
Craig leads her to the bedroom.
Charlie looks back at the party as kids gather for the New Years countdown.
Patrick leads the charge.
In a QUICK FLASH, we see 7 year old Charlie with Aunt Helen on Christmas Eve.
She bends to whisper in his ear.
AUNT HELEN It'll be our little secret, all right?
We are BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie takes a deep breath and tries to remember that he's at a New Year's party.
PATRICK 7-6-5-4-3-2-1.
PATRICK Happy New Year!
The crowd cheers, leaving ghosts of themselves.
Charlie gets up from the sofa and walks out of Bob's house.
Charlie walks down the road under a streetlight.
Silhouette.
The road is icy.
Charlie lays down and starts moving his arms in the snow.
The memories begin to haunt him.
7 year old Charlie waves goodbye to Aunt Helen as she drives away through the landing strip for Santa Claus.
16 year old Charlie blinks.
The memories come faster.
Aunt Helen drives past a tall snow drift.
She looks down at the 45 of The Beatles in the seat next to her.
She smiles at Charlie's birthday present.
Then, she looks up as the headlights of the semi truck smash the windows with a CRASH!
Charlie's mother opens the door, revealing a POLICEMAN.
He turns to Charlie in his party hat.
7 years old and confused.
16 year old Charlie lays on the snow, shivering, as the image goes high above to reveal he's made a snow angel.
The Emergency room is bustling on New Year's Day.
Charlie looks up as the POLICE, DOCTORS, and his PARENTS tower over him.
He is terrified and does what any kid would do.
He lies his ass off.
POLICEMAN Did your older friends pressure you?
CHARLIE No one pressured me into anything.
CHARLIE I would never do drugs, officer.
CHARLIE Never.
POLICEMAN Then, how did you happen to be passed out on the ground at 6 in the morning?
CHARLIE Well, um...
CHARLIE I was really tired, and uh...
CHARLIE I was feeling feverish.
CHARLIE So, I went outside for a walk, just to get some cold air.
CHARLIE And I started seeing things.
CHARLIE So, I passed out.
He waits to see if this worked.
And then, unexpectedly...
MOTHER You're seeing things again, Charlie?
CHARLIE Not, uh...
CHARLIE Not really.
The tires squish the grey slush puddle as the busses pull into the dreary parking lot.
School is back in session.
Charlie shakes off the cold, then takes off his overcoat to reveal...
he's wearing his suit from Secret Santa.
All the kids stare.
Charlie realizes he made a terrible mistake.
CHARLIE It was a Christmas present.
Charlie sits as Bill hands out the book for the semester...
The Great Gatsby.
As the kids chatter, Bill gives Charlie his own book to start the year...
The Stranger.
CHARLIE Did you have fun on your break?
BILL More fun than you're going to have today, Sinatra.
Bill pats his shoulder and moves on.
The Smart Ass Freshman looks at Charlie and whispers.
SMART ASS FRESHMAN Nice look, jag off.
The Rocky Horror faithful enter the theater.
SAM I called him 30 times.
Mary Elizabeth and the kids get ready for the floor show.
MARY ELIZABETH Well what are we supposed to do?
MARY ELIZABETH We're going on in 10 minutes!
The phone rings.
Mary Elizabeth picks up.
Charlie turns to Brad, sitting next to him.
Charlie is freaking out.
CHARLIE But they said in health class--
BRAD HAYS They say that about LSD to scare you.
CHARLIE Are you sure?
BRAD HAYS Charlie, you're fine, man.
Mary Elizabeth hangs up the phone, frustrated.
MARY ELIZABETH Guys, we have an emergency.
MARY ELIZABETH Craig flaked out on us again.
MARY ELIZABETH I need a Rocky.
MARY ELIZABETH Brad?
BRAD HAYS No way.
BRAD HAYS There are people out here.
The group is deflated.
They all start thinking.
After a beat, Mary Elizabeth looks at Charlie.
MARY ELIZABETH Charlie...
MARY ELIZABETH take off your clothes.
You know those dreams you have when you are standing in front of 200 people in your underwear?
Well, this is no dream.
We hear a heart beat as Charlie dances out of the Rocky gauze and finds himself standing in tight gold underwear, looking out at 200 people, cheering him on.
His friends can't stop smiling.
Especially Mary Elizabeth, who watches Charlie's little butt in the gold undies.
She
"Touch-A, Touch-A, Touch Me" is in full swing.
Sam slinks over to Charlie dressed in her white bra and slip.
SAM So if anything grows while you pose.
SAM I'll oil you up and drop you down.
SAM And that's just one small fraction of the main attraction.
SAM You need a friendly hand.
SAM And I need action!
Sam grabs Charlie's hands and rubs them all over her chest.
SAM (CONT'D) Ah!
SAM (CONT'D) Touch a touch a touch me!
SAM (CONT'D) I wanna be dirty!
SAM (CONT'D) Thrill me.
SAM (CONT'D) Chill me.
SAM (CONT'D) Fulfill me!
SAM (CONT'D) Creature of the night!
The song continues.
We see flashes of the night's performance as Charlie goes from train wreck to triumph.
Charlie joins Sam in the kick line, and it feels like it's just the two of them.
On the final beat, Sam gasps...
SAM (CONT'D) Creature of the night!
The song ends.
The cast bows.
Sam and Patrick push Charlie in front for his own curtain call.
Everyone cheers.
It's the night he'll never forget.
The wind whips.
That bracing February cold.
Charlie helps Mary Elizabeth carry the costumes outside to her car.
CHARLIE Maybe I could join the cast as an alternate or something?
MARY ELIZABETH We're filled up now, but they'll need people after we leave for college.
MARY ELIZABETH I could put in a good word for you.
CHARLIE That'd be great.
CHARLIE Thanks.
They put the box in her trunk.
Snap it closed.
We can't help but notice the "Keep Your Laws Off My Body" bumper sticker as Mary Elizabeth tries her best to flirt.
MARY ELIZABETH Charlie...
MARY ELIZABETH have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?
CHARLIE The one where the girl asks the guy.
MARY ELIZABETH Yeah.
MARY ELIZABETH Well, obviously, it's completely stupid and sexist.
MARY ELIZABETH It's like, "Hey, thanks for the crumb."
MARY ELIZABETH And normally, I'd just blow it off because school dances suck torture.
MARY ELIZABETH But, you know, it's my last year, and...
MARY ELIZABETH would you maybe want to go with me?
CHARLIE You want to go with me?
MARY ELIZABETH I'm sick of macho guys.
MARY ELIZABETH And you looked really cute in your costume.
MARY ELIZABETH So, what do you say?
Charlie thinks and thinks and...
Ding dong.
Charlie's mom opens the door for MARY ELIZABETH.
Charlie straightens out his church suit.
So nervous.
MOTHER You must be Mary Elizabeth.
MOTHER It's so good to meet you.
MARY ELIZABETH You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
FATHER Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.
Charlie and Mary Elizabeth stand next to Candace and Derek.
FATHER OK, a little closer together.
FATHER That looks nice.
FATHER Buddhist, I need you to smile a little bit more.
FATHER There you go.
FATHER Nice.
Cheese!
White flash.
The picture of 4 kids.
Smiling big.
Charlie and Mary Elizabeth slow dance to an 80's love song.
Sweaty palms.
Awkward.
Hands on hips.
Horror.
Charlie looks around the gym.
He sees Alice dancing with her date, an EFFEMINATE GOTH KID (17).
We'll never meet him, but he'll make us laugh once.
Charlie then watches Patrick dance with Sam.
He follows Patrick's gaze across the floor to Brad, who dances with a SENIOR GIRL (18).
Charlie sees the boys look at each other.
For one moment, it's like they're dancing together.
Mary Elizabeth is at the punch bowl with the gang.
Charlie sees Sam, standing by the wall, looking sad.
He approaches.
CHARLIE Are you having a good time?
SAM Not really.
SAM How about you?
CHARLIE I don't know.
CHARLIE This is my first date, so I don't know what to compare it to.
SAM Don't worry.
SAM You're doing fine.
Charlie joins her at the wall.
Mary Elizabeth gives them a quick, jealous look.
CHARLIE I'm sorry Craig didn't come.
SAM Yeah.
SAM He said he didn't want to go to some stupid high school dance.
SAM Can't say I blame him.
CHARLIE I don't know.
CHARLIE If you like it, he should come.
SAM Thanks, Charlie.
SAM Have a beautiful first date.
SAM You deserve it.
CHARLIE I'll try not to make you too jealous.
56. He said it to cheer her up.
56. Sam forces a smile and leaves.
Mary Elizabeth approaches Charlie on the antique sofa.
She uncorks a bottle of wine.
POP!
She hands him the bottle.
MARY ELIZABETH Mmmm.
MARY ELIZABETH Now, let it breathe.
MARY ELIZABETH Mary Elizabeth walks over to the vintage turntable.
MARY ELIZABETH She turns on the gas fireplace with a remote control.
MARY ELIZABETH Roar!
CHARLIE This is sure a nice house.
MARY ELIZABETH Thanks.
MARY ELIZABETH Mary Elizabeth drops the needle on a vinyl LP.
MARY ELIZABETH A Doo Wop make-out classic begins to play.
MARY ELIZABETH She dances over to Charlie.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Mmmm.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Don't you just love old music?
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Good.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Because I made you a mix of it.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I'd love to expose you to great things.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Like Billie Holiday and foreign films.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) She pours the wine.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Charlie looks at the bottle.
CHARLIE This merlot is really fancy.
MARY ELIZABETH Yeah.
MARY ELIZABETH My dad collects wine, but he doesn't drink.
MARY ELIZABETH That's weird, isn't it?
CHARLIE I guess.
CHARLIE Where are your parents?
MARY ELIZABETH Their club is hosting a cotillion or something racist.
MARY ELIZABETH They'll be gone all night.
MARY ELIZABETH Mary Elizabeth drops her necklace with a thud.
MARY ELIZABETH Charlie looks around.
MARY ELIZABETH Heart beating.
CHARLIE That's sure a nice fire.
MARY ELIZABETH Yeah.
MARY ELIZABETH After I'm done being a lobbyist, I want to move to a house like this in Cape Cod.
MARY ELIZABETH That sounds nice, doesn't it?
CHARLIE Yeah.
CHARLIE She reaches out and touches his chest.
MARY ELIZABETH Your heart is beating really fast.
CHARLIE Is it?
MARY ELIZABETH Here, feel.
MARY ELIZABETH She puts her hand on his.
MARY ELIZABETH Moves it to his chest.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Charlie?
CHARLIE Uh-huh?
MARY ELIZABETH Do you like me?
CHARLIE Uh-huh.
MARY ELIZABETH You know what I mean.
CHARLIE I think so.
MARY ELIZABETH Don't be nervous.
MARY ELIZABETH She slowly moves his hand to her dress strap.
MARY ELIZABETH It falls off her shoulder.
MARY ELIZABETH She leans in for a red wine kiss.
MARY ELIZABETH She guides his hand over her bra.
MARY ELIZABETH He feels her breast.
MARY ELIZABETH Wow.
For a quick moment, Charlie imagines he is kissing Sam.
Broken by...
Mary Elizabeth moves his hand away.
Charlie blinks, taking a moment to realize Sam's not the one in the room.
The song is over.
The needle turns at the end of the record.
MARY ELIZABETH Charlie...
MARY ELIZABETH She gives him one last kiss.
MARY ELIZABETH Content, she lays down on his lap.
MARY ELIZABETH Peaceful.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I didn't know how it was going to go tonight, but it was really nice, huh?
CHARLIE Yeah.
MARY ELIZABETH I can't believe it.
MARY ELIZABETH You of all people.
MARY ELIZABETH I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.
MARY ELIZABETH We land on Charlie's face.
MARY ELIZABETH "What?" And then, we hear the
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Oh, shit!
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) My parents!
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) The mad scramble for clothes begins.
Mary Elizabeth's car pulls in front of Charlie's house.
Charlie gets out.
Wanting to say he's not her boyfriend.
Not knowing how.
Mary Elizabeth smiles.
Smitten.
MARY ELIZABETH See you Monday.
MARY ELIZABETH With that, she backs out of the driveway.
MARY ELIZABETH We see him from the back of her car, getting smaller and smaller.
MARY ELIZABETH His stomach already filling with acid.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Dear Friend...
CHARLIE (V.O.) I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but things are a total disaster.
Sam, Patrick, and Alice are seated around the table.
Mary Elizabeth has her arms around Charlie.
Smothering him.
MARY ELIZABETH We're literally making out, and I'm in my bra.
MARY ELIZABETH Hello!
MARY ELIZABETH And the front door opens.
MARY ELIZABETH It's my parents!
MARY ELIZABETH I'm scrambling to get my dress on.
MARY ELIZABETH It was crazy.
MARY ELIZABETH Right, babe?
MARY ELIZABETH Charlie nods, tortured.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I probably should have been honest about how I didn't want to go out with Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but I really didn't want to hurt her feelings.
Ash Wednesday.
Charlie gets out of the school bus to immediately find Mary Elizabeth waiting for him.
She sees the cross of ashes on his forehead.
She thinks his ashes are a smudge.
She cleans it.
CHARLIE (V.O.) You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice person underneath the part of her that hates everyone.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And since I heard that having a girlfriend makes you happy, I tried hard to love her like I love Sam.
MARY ELIZABETH Can you believe it's almost our two week anniversary?
CHARLIE I know.
A double date.
Craig and Sam buy the tickets to see the silent classic, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.
CHARLIE (V.O.) So, I took her on double dates.
MARY ELIZABETH Your first foreign film.
MARY ELIZABETH Vegans don't eat butter.
MARY ELIZABETH Charlie tries not to feel Mary Elizabeth's sweaty hand.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And I tried not to mind that she loves to hold hands even when her hands are sweaty.
Just like Sadie's except...
the fire in the fireplace is out.
We move from the fireplace to Charlie, touching Mary Elizabeth's breasts over her sweater.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And I had to admit something really upsetting.
CHARLIE (V.O.) But I am tired of touching her boobs.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I thought maybe if she would just let me pick the make-out music once in awhile, we might have a chance.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Charlie looks at the Ani DiFranco Mix on the stereo.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Sighs.
The gang is there.
Walden rests on Charlie's lunch tray.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And maybe if she didn't put down the books that Mr. Anderson gives me.
MARY ELIZABETH Walden?
MARY ELIZABETH I read it in 7th grade.
MARY ELIZABETH I would have called it "On Boring Pond."
Ring!
Charlie grabs the cordless.
He looks at Patrick's clock.
3:13pm.
His voice can no longer hide his quiet rage.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Or if she would stop calling me the minute I get home from school when I have absolutely nothing to talk about other than the bus ride home...
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) That dairy just sits with you.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) It walks with you.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Charlie calmly puts down the phone and leaves the room.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) We
Charlie is so miserable.
His mom is sympathetic.
MOTHER She's on the phone right now?
MOTHER Charlie, you have to break up with her.
CHARLIE I can do that?
CHARLIE Charlie's father leans back from the sofa and his newspaper.
FATHER For Christ's sake...
FATHER I need to use the phone!
He returns.
Mary Elizabeth is still talking on the cordless.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) I'll give you this book.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) It's really how I became a vegan--
CHARLIE (V.O.) I know I should have been honest, but I was getting so mad, it was starting to scare me.
CHARLIE (V.O.) He looks back at the clock.
CHARLIE (V.O.) 3:23pm.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Um...
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Mary Elizabeth.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Can I talk to you--
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Charlie.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Please, don't interrupt.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) You know I hate that.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Charlie goes to his quiet place.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Tick.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Tick.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Tick.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I just wish I could have found another way to break up.
CHARLIE (V.O.) In hindsight, I probably could not have picked a worse way to be honest with Mary Elizabeth.
Truth or dare.
The gang is seated in a circle, drinking from plastic cups.
Charlie sits between Mary Elizabeth and Sam.
PATRICK Who are you talking to?
BOB I dare you to kiss Alice.
PATRICK Get ready, breeder.
As Patrick approaches an apprehensive Alice...
CRAIG Mary Elizabeth?
CRAIG Samantha told me that you got into Harvard.
CRAIG Congratulations.
MARY ELIZABETH Thank you.
MARY ELIZABETH This one still hasn't gotten me flowers.
MARY ELIZABETH But I forgive you.
She kisses him.
Charlie bites his cheeks.
Sam looks a little depressed.
CRAIG Don't worry about Penn State.
CRAIG You're just wait-listed.
PATRICK Excuse me, everyone, but you're missing some hot "fag on goth" action.
Anticipation.
Patrick is getting ready to plant the biggest kiss on Alice when she jumps him.
Everyone groans.
Ew!
Laughter.
Patrick looks for the next person.
Charlie's heart pounds.
Don't pick me!
Please!
PATRICK (CONT'D) Okay.
PATRICK (CONT'D) My turn.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Um...
PATRICK (CONT'D) let's think...
PATRICK (CONT'D) Charlie...
PATRICK (CONT'D) truth or dare?
Silence.
Thinking.
Finally...
CHARLIE Truth.
PATRICK How is your first relationship going?
CHARLIE It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't have to break up with her.
PATRICK Charlie?
PATRICK Truth or dare?
PATRICK Charlie blinks.
PATRICK It was all fantasy.
CHARLIE Dare.
PATRICK I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips.
PATRICK Notice I charitably said girl and not person because let's face it...
PATRICK I'd smoke all you bitches.
PATRICK Alice hits him.
PATRICK Laughter.
PATRICK Charlie thinks.
PATRICK He looks at Mary Elizabeth, then turns to Sam.
PATRICK Before Sam can even react...
PATRICK Charlie plants a kiss right on her lips.
PATRICK When he opens his eyes, he looks around, and realizes the magnitude of his mistake.
PATRICK Everyone stares.
PATRICK After a horrible silence...
PATRICK (CONT'D) Now that's fucked up.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Without a word, Mary Elizabeth just stands, dignified, and goes into the kitchen.
CHARLIE Mary Elizabeth, I'm sorry.
CHARLIE I'm--
CHARLIE Alice follows Mary Elizabeth.
CHARLIE Sam is close behind.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Sam?!
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Sam!
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I didn't mean anything by it.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Sam turns and looks at him.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) She doesn't even recognize him.
SAM What the hell is wrong with you?
SAM Charlie is devastated.
They move to the driveway.
Charlie feels awful.
Panicky.
PATRICK Trust me.
PATRICK You don't want to go back there.
CHARLIE But, I...
CHARLIE I'm sorry...
CHARLIE I didn't mean to do anything.
PATRICK I know you didn't, but look...
PATRICK I hate to be the one to break this, but there's history with Mary Elizabeth and Sam.
PATRICK Other guys.
PATRICK Things that have nothing to do with you.
PATRICK But...
PATRICK it's best if you stay away for awhile.
CHARLIE Oh.
CHARLIE Okay.
CHARLIE How long do you think?
CHARLIE Silence.
CHARLIE Charlie looks over at Patrick, who wears a grave expression.
CHARLIE It's going to be a long time.
CHARLIE We hear the sound of the typewriter.
Charlie sits at his desk.
It looks like he's barely slept.
He begins typing.
The keys up close and loud.
Clak.
CLOSE UP TYPING: "Dear friend, I have not seen my friends for 2 weeks now.
I am starting to get bad again."
Charlie stares at the typewriter.
And remembers.
Little Charlie pops his head around the corner from the hallway.
He looks at something we can't see yet.
Present.
Knock.
Knock.
Charlie's mom opens the door.
MOTHER We're going to be late for Easter Mass.
CHARLIE I'll...
CHARLIE I'll be there in a minute.
65. Charlie forces a smile, then looks back at the typewriter.
65. And tries to shake off the memory.
Little Charlie looks at Aunt Helen as she smokes her cigarette and sobs.
Charlie is lost.
His family sits in the pews for Easter Mass.
Charlie watches the PRIEST recite the Lord's prayer.
PRIEST Our Father who art in Heaven.
PRIEST Hallowed be Thy name.
PRIEST Thy kingdom come--
7 year old Charlie watches the PRIEST recite the Lord's prayer.
He looks at Aunt Helen's picture on the coffin.
PRIEST Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.
PRIEST Give us this day our daily bread.
16 year old Charlie looks haunted by the memory.
PRIEST And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us--
PRIEST The voices drift away and all Charlie can see is...
7 year old Charlie takes Aunt Helen's hand to make her stop crying.
16 year old Charlie blinks as the voices come back.
PRIEST And lead us not into temptation.
PRIEST But deliver us from--
Charlie on the phone.
His voice wavers a bit.
Desperate.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Mary Elizabeth...
CHARLIE (V.O.) I...
CHARLIE (V.O.) uh...
CHARLIE (V.O.) I've been listening to the Billie Holiday CD every night and--
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) It's too late, Charlie.
CHARLIE I know.
CHARLIE I just feel really bad about what I did.
CHARLIE I just get so messed up inside like I'm - not there or something.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Tell it to someone who cares.
CHARLIE I know.
CHARLIE I'm sorry.
CHARLIE I just.
CHARLIE We've all become such good friends--
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Good friends?
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) You mean the people I've known since kindergarten that you've known for 6 months?
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Those good friends?
CHARLIE Oh.
CHARLIE Yeah.
CHARLIE I mean I don't want to do anything to ruin our--
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) It's ruined.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Okay?
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) So, stop calling everyone.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.) Stop embarrassing yourself.
CHARLIE Okay.
CHARLIE I will.
CHARLIE Goodbye, Mar--
CHARLIE Dial tone.
CHARLIE Charlie hangs up the phone.
Charlie is terribly anxious.
He watches Bob groom some pot.
CHARLIE Something's wrong with me--
BOB Don't worry about it.
BOB Hey...
BOB you hear from Patrick?
CHARLIE No.
CHARLIE He told me to stay away.
BOB Oh...
BOB you don't know?
CHARLIE Why?
CHARLIE Why?
CHARLIE What happened?
BOB Brad's father caught them together.
As kids open lockers and move to morning period, Charlie stares at Brad.
He has a black eye and cuts on his face.
He look like he was beaten up badly.
Students whisper gossip.
GOSSIP WHISPERS "Some Lebo kids jumped him outside the O."
GOSSIP WHISPERS "It was some kids from North Hills."
GOSSIP WHISPERS "That's not what I heard."
GOSSIP WHISPERS Brad moves into the arms of CHARLOTTE (18), cheerleader cute.
GOSSIP WHISPERS As Brad kisses her, Charlie sees Patrick down the hall, watching them.
GOSSIP WHISPERS Patrick closes his locker.
GOSSIP WHISPERS Hurting.
CHARLIE Are you okay?
PATRICK Not now, Charlie.
PATRICK I'm sorry.
PATRICK Patrick storms off.
Charlie sits at his table, alone.
He watches Patrick leave the lunch line, passing a chorus of...
Patrick says nothing.
He's too sad to fight the mob today.
He just moves to his table when the Nose Tackle sticks out his leg.
Patrick falls on his tray.
The kids laugh.
NOSE TACKLE Oops.
NOSE TACKLE Sorry, Nothing.
Patrick smiles to himself, dusts off, and turns to Brad.
PATRICK You going to do something?
BRAD HAYS What are you talking about?
PATRICK Your pet ape just tripped me.
PATRICK Are you going to say something?
BRAD HAYS Why would I?
PATRICK You know why.
It's too far.
Brad can feel people staring.
BRAD HAYS This is pathetic, man.
BRAD HAYS Your fixation on me.
Brad's friends laugh.
Patrick's eyes narrow.
PATRICK Do you want your friends to know how you got those bruises?
PATRICK Really?
BRAD HAYS I got jumped in a parking lot.
PATRICK Where?
PATRICK In Schenley Park?
PATRICK Do they know about Schenley Park?
PATRICK Do you guys know about Schenley Park?
Brad stands and gets right in Patrick's face.
BRAD HAYS I don't know what kind of sick shit you're trying to pull.
BRAD HAYS But you better walk away now...
BRAD HAYS Nothing.
PATRICK Fine.
PATRICK Say hi to your dad for me.
Patrick turns and leaves.
And then, as an afterthought...
BRAD HAYS Whatever...
BRAD HAYS faggot.
Brad's friends laugh.
Patrick stops and turns.
Last chance.
PATRICK What did you call me?
BRAD HAYS I called you a faggo--
Smack.
Before Brad can even finish, Patrick throws a vicious right to the cheek.
Brad tackles him.
And the two start fighting.
The cafeteria erupts in NOISE.
PATRICK Say that shit again!
PATRICK Say that shit again!
Brad's football buddies rise and peel Patrick off Brad.
Mary Elizabeth and Sam jump up from their corner table.
MARY ELIZABETH It's Patrick!
The cafeteria gets louder.
The Nose Tackle holds Patrick up.
More Noise.
The Linebacker hits Patrick in the face.
SAM No!
SAM No!
Sam rushes up and the Nose Tackle pushes her down.
She lands on her tail bone.
Thud.
Patrick gets hit a couple of times in the face.
The kids cheer the fight.
It's getting louder and louder with more and more noise.
And then...
Silence.
Charlie comes out from a blink.
He calmly looks around.
For a moment, he doesn't understand where he is.
He looks up.
All the kids are staring at him.
Mary Elizabeth.
Alice.
Brad.
They are all quiet.
Afraid of him.
Charlie looks at his hand, clenched in a fist.
It is already covered with...
70. Charlie's confused until he sees the Linebacker holding his broken, bloody nose.
70. He's looking at Charlie...
70. Terrified.
70. The image pans over.
70. The Nose Tackle is on the ground.
70. Charlie stands over them.
70. He is disconnected.
70. It's an out of body experience.
70. He reaches out and helps Patrick to his feet.
70. Then, he calmly turns and stares right through Brad.
CHARLIE If you touch my friends again, I'll blind you.
CHARLIE Brad is stunned.
CHARLIE So is everyone...
CHARLIE except Sam.
Charlie sits in the waiting room of the principal's office.
He looks through the glass where Principal Small talks to Brad.
After a beat, she pats Brad's shoulder and opens the door.
Leaving Charlie and Brad alone in the waiting room.
Just as Brad is about to leave...
BRAD HAYS Charlie?
CHARLIE Yeah?
BRAD HAYS Thanks for stopping them.
CHARLIE Sure, Brad.
CHARLIE Brad doesn't look at him.
CHARLIE He just moves on.
Charlie exits the building.
Kids stare at him.
Then, look away.
Charlie feels very lost until he sees...
Sam.
She smiles.
It brings him back instantly.
And then, gently...
SAM How you doing, Charlie?
CHARLIE I don't know.
CHARLIE I keep trying, but...
CHARLIE I can't really remember what I did.
CHARLIE Sam can see he's afraid of himself.
CHARLIE She nods, sympathetic.
SAM Do you want me to tell you?
CHARLIE Yeah.
SAM You saved my brother.
SAM That's what you did.
CHARLIE So, you're not scared of me?
SAM No.
CHARLIE And can we be friends again?
SAM Of course.
SAM The minute she hugs him, the numb goes away.
SAM She kisses the top of his head and puts her arm around his shoulder.
SAM They begin walking away.
SAM (CONT'D) Come on.
SAM (CONT'D) Let's go be psychos together.
Mary Elizabeth looks at us because she wants us to know...
MARY ELIZABETH I'm dating Peter now.
MARY ELIZABETH She motions to PETER.
MARY ELIZABETH College.
MARY ELIZABETH Glasses.
MARY ELIZABETH Good looking-ish.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) He's in college with Craig.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) He's opinionated, and we have intellectual debates.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) You were very sweet, but our relationship was too one-sided.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I know this is hard for you.
CHARLIE I'm just glad you're happy.
MARY ELIZABETH Okay.
MARY ELIZABETH Mary Elizabeth joins Peter.
MARY ELIZABETH Charlie looks at his friends.
72. that says, "They forget.
72. I don't."
72. After a beat, Patrick comes downstairs.
72. He looks sad with his bruises.
PATRICK Hey Craig, Sam will be down soon.
MARY ELIZABETH We're going to miss the movie.
CRAIG Yeah, I'll go put some pep in her step.
CRAIG As Craig moves upstairs, Patrick approaches Charlie.
PATRICK Hey...
PATRICK you wanna get out of here?
CHARLIE Sure, Patrick.
Patrick drives Sam's truck up the hill to the overlook.
PATRICK (V.O.) I'll tell you something, Charlie.
PATRICK (V.O.) I feel good.
PATRICK (V.O.) You know what I mean?
PATRICK (V.O.) Maybe tomorrow I'll take you to this karaoke place downtown.
PATRICK (V.O.) And this club off the strip.
PATRICK (V.O.) They don't card.
PATRICK (V.O.) And the Schenley Park scene.
PATRICK (V.O.) You gotta see the "fruit loop" at least one time.
Charlie and Patrick walk the lighted path, howling at the moon.
Patrick holds a thermos, filled with who knows what.
PATRICK Oh, my God.
PATRICK My life is officially an after school special.
PATRICK Son of a bitch!
CHARLIE It kind of is.
CHARLIE It so is.
CHARLIE More laughter.
CHARLIE They arrive at the lookout.
CHARLIE They drink.
PATRICK So, you ever hear the one about Lily Miller?
CHARLIE I don't know.
PATRICK Really?
PATRICK I thought your brother would have told you.
PATRICK It's a classic.
CHARLIE Maybe.
PATRICK So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker.
PATRICK And this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity.
PATRICK So, she did it really proper.
PATRICK She packed a picnic.
PATRICK Stole a bottle of wine.
PATRICK Everything was perfect, and they're just about to 'do it' when they realize they forgot the condoms.
PATRICK So, what do you think happened?
CHARLIE I don't know.
PATRICK They did it with one of the sandwich bags.
They start laughing and screaming.
CHARLIE Ew!
CHARLIE That's disgusting!
PATRICK Yes!
PATRICK It is!
PATRICK Let's keep the train rolling.
PATRICK Suburban legends.
PATRICK Charlie!
Patrick points to Charlie, who thinks...
CHARLIE Uh.
CHARLIE Well...
CHARLIE there was this girl named Second Base Stace.
CHARLIE She had boobs in the 4th grade--
PATRICK Mosquito bites.
PATRICK Promising.
PATRICK Go.
CHARLIE And she let some of the boys feel them.
PATRICK That's your suburban legend?
PATRICK Did you at least cop a feel?
CHARLIE No.
PATRICK Of course not.
PATRICK You went home, listened to "Asleep," wrote a poem about her self- esteem--
CHARLIE Fine!
CHARLIE Okay.
CHARLIE Your turn.
Patrick walks over and sits down next to Charlie.
PATRICK Yeah, I've got one.
PATRICK Well, there was this one guy.
PATRICK Queer as a 3 dollar bill.
PATRICK Guy's father didn't know about his son.
PATRICK So, he comes down into the basement one night when he's supposed to be out of town.
PATRICK Catches his son with another boy.
PATRICK So, he starts beating him.
PATRICK But not like the slap kind.
PATRICK Like the real kind.
PATRICK And the boyfriend says, "Stop.
PATRICK You're killing him."
PATRICK And the son just yells "Get out."
PATRICK And eventually the boyfriend just did.
Patrick stops.
Gripped by sad.
He can't shake.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Why can't you save anybody?
CHARLIE I don't know.
PATRICK Forget it.
PATRICK I'm free now, right?
PATRICK I could meet the love of my life any second now.
PATRICK Things will be different now, and that's good.
PATRICK I just need to meet a good guy.
CHARLIE Yeah.
Patrick looks at him.
Charlie has never seen him so vulnerable.
After a beat...
Patrick kisses Charlie on the mouth.
Unsure of what to do, Charlie lets it happen.
His eyes open the whole time.
A moment, then Patrick looks at Charlie.
He collapses into his chest.
PATRICK I'm sorry.
CHARLIE It's alright.
75. Charlie holds his friend as Patrick begins to cry.
75. And we leave them, the city lights small in the distance.
We see the truck glide down the highway.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I've been spending a lot of time with Patrick.
CHARLIE (V.O.) He begins every night really excited.
Patrick and Charlie are parked at the entrance of Schenley Park.
Patrick speaks, very animated, until...
CHARLIE (V.O.) He always says he feels free, and tonight is his destiny.
CHARLIE (V.O.) But after awhile, he runs out of things to keep himself numb.
CHARLIE (V.O.) ...
CHARLIE (V.O.) the words leave him, and we can see how sad he really is.
Patrick hands Sam an envelope.
Sam holds it.
Pins and needles.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Then, Sam got her letter from Penn State.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Sam opens the letter.
CHARLIE (V.O.) She reads.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Tears instantly well up in her eyes.
CHARLIE (V.O.) She leaves the room and walks down the hall.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Patrick picks up the letter.
PATRICK "We will require you to take our summer session at the main campus immediately following your high school graduation."
PATRICK She got in, Charlie.
PATRICK Charlie turns back to Sam.
PATRICK She holds him with sweet relief and redemption.
Charlie laughs with his friends in the cafeteria.
CHARLIE (V.O.) After that all Patrick could talk about
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) did get into NYU Film School.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Patrick is going to the University of Washington because he wants to be near the music in Seattle.
Charlie and a group of students stand, looking up at the wall, which is covered with...
CHARLIE (V.O.) But he wasn't going to leave without organizing the best senior prank ever.
CHARLIE (V.O.) ...
CHARLIE (V.O.) All The Shop Tools Painted Pink
CHARLIE (V.O.) The shop teacher, Mr. Callahan stares at the wall, furious.
CHARLIE (V.O.) As the students gawk, Charlie smiles to himself.
Sam and the girls chat excitedly.
Summer is almost here.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Sam is going to leave right after graduation.
CHARLIE (V.O.) It all feels very exciting; I just wish it were happening to me.
Charlie sits on his bed, finishing the letter.
CHARLIE Especially because ever since I blacked out in the cafeteria, it's been getting worse.
CHARLIE And I can't turn it off this time.
CHARLIE Charlie puts down the letter.
The kids pass their copies of The Great Gatsby up to the front, where Bill collects them for next year's freshmen.
The class is buzzing loud.
BILL Guys, you want to pass your copies of Gatsby up to the front please?
BILL And I know it's the last day, but if we could just keep it to a dull roar, I'd appreciate it.
BILL The class quiets down.
BILL (CONT'D) Thank you for such a great year.
BILL (CONT'D) I had a blast.
BILL (CONT'D) I hope you did, too.
BILL (CONT'D) And I hope you have a great time this summer on your vacations.
BILL (CONT'D) Now, who here is going to be reading for pleasure this summer?
BILL (CONT'D) Charlie looks to see if anyone is watching...
BILL (CONT'D) then, decides to raise his hand anyway.
BILL (CONT'D) Bill is proud.
BILL (CONT'D) Very good, Charlie.
BILL (CONT'D) Who else?
BILL (CONT'D) Charlie looks at the Smart Ass Freshman who tormented him all year.
BILL (CONT'D) She sighs.
BILL (CONT'D) Nothing left to say to him.
The last kids exit the classroom.
Charlie walks down the aisle and stands in front of Bill.
BILL Last day.
CHARLIE Yeah.
CHARLIE So, uh, I know it's none of my business, but have you decided...
CHARLIE are you going to New York?
BILL Well, my wife and I like it here, and I think I might be better at teaching than writing.
BILL Charlie is relieved.
BILL Bill is staying.
BILL (CONT'D) So, uh Charlie...
BILL (CONT'D) I was thinking maybe I could still give you books next year.
CHARLIE Yeah.
CHARLIE Yeah.
BILL I think you could write one of them one day.
CHARLIE Really?
BILL I do.
78. Charlie is quiet.
78. Then...
CHARLIE You're the best teacher I ever had.
BILL Thank you.
BILL He gives Bill a shy sideways hug.
BILL The two men say nothing else.
BILL Charlie waves and leaves.
BILL Bill smiles to himself.
Times Square has nothing on these seniors.
Charlie watches the gang on their last day of high school.
When the clock hits 10 seconds to 3pm, all the students chant...
STUDENT Oh, my God, get me the hell out of here!
1! They all cheer and hug each other.
1! Patrick loses his mind with joy and charges down the hallway.
A brilliant sunset.
We see the gang.
In silhouette.
Running up the bleachers after the sun.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Dear Friend...
CHARLIE (V.O.) I wanted to tell you about us running.
CHARLIE (V.O.) There was this beautiful sunset.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And just a few hours before, everyone I love had their last day of high school ever.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And I was happy because they were happy, even though I counted, and I have 1,095 days to go.
Prom night.
Charlie sees Candace posing for Dad's camera.
For a moment, we think Candace went to prom with Derek.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I kept thinking about what school was going to be like without them as they
79. As mom and dad move out of the way, we realize Candace is standing with her 3 best girlfriends.
79. They look beautiful.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) My sister finally decided to break up with Derek and go stag with her girlfriends instead.
Prom night continues.
The antique limo is so garish, it's great.
Charlie snaps pictures with Sam's mom and Patrick's dad.
Mary Elizabeth is with her boyfriend, Peter.
Alice stands with Patrick, dashing in his Mod Suit Tux.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And then there was Sam...
CHARLIE (V.O.) The image moves to the front of the house, where Sam emerges.
CHARLIE (V.O.) She wears a vintage flapper dress from the 20's.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Radiant.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I've looked at her pictures since that night.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I like to see how happy she was before she knew.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Sam joins Craig.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) They kiss for the cameras, then run with the rest of the gang to the limosine.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) They were in a hotel suite after prom when the truth came out...
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) The gang poses for more pictures in front of the limo.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Basically, Craig has been cheating on Sam the whole time.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) When I heard that, I kept thinking about the happy girl in these pictures.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Because she doesn't have 1,095 days to go.
Graduation Day.
The place is packed with graduating seniors and families.
Charlie's mom and dad fawn over Candace with the video camera.
Charlie finally finds...
Sam.
CHARLIE (V.O.) She made it.
CHARLIE (V.O.) This is her time.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And no one should be able to take that away.
CHARLIE (V.O.) They approach each other and hug.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Congratulations.
PATRICK Oh, Charlie's here!
PATRICK Guys, group photo!
PATRICK We should all take a group photo.
PATRICK Get against the railing and try to look suave!
PATRICK The kids line up for the picture they will always remember.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Yeah, this is the one.
PATRICK (CONT'D) That's going to be a great angle.
PATRICK (CONT'D) Patrick bows to reveal the top of his cap reads, "Nothing Hates You."
PATRICK (CONT'D) The parents line up cameras.
PATRICK (CONT'D) "Cheese!" Snap.
The grandfather clock reads 9:30pm.
The room is festive under streamers wishing Sam luck at Penn State.
The kids sign each other's yearbooks.
Charlie sees Sam smile at old photos.
He misses her already.
CHARLIE (V.O.) At her going away party, I wanted her to know about that night we went through the tunnel.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And how for the first time, I felt like I belonged somewhere.
10:28pm.
Charlie doesn't know where the time keeps going.
Sam opens goodbye presents from her friends.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And tomorrow, she's leaving.
CHARLIE (V.O.) So, I wanted to give her a part of me.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Charlie watches Sam pick up his present.
CHARLIE (V.O.) She carefully peels the tape to reveal that Charlie gave her all of his books.
SAM Are these all your books, Charlie?
SAM He nods.
SAM They lock eyes and do not speak.
The pictures are down.
The dressers empty.
The suitcase is open on the bed.
Charlie watches Sam fold clothes and put them in her suitcase.
He has promised himself he will not cry.
Even when she packs away his Beatles 45 of "Something."
Instead, he looks at her and tries to remember every detail.
Her hair and brown eyes and sound of her voice.
SAM Thanks for staying up with me.
CHARLIE Sure.
CHARLIE My brother said Penn State has a restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.
CHARLIE You have to get a grilled stickie on your first night.
CHARLIE It's a tradition.
SAM That sounds like fun.
CHARLIE Yeah.
CHARLIE Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, and you won't even think about this place anymore.
SAM Yes, I will.
SAM Sam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room.
SAM They stand next to each other.
SAM Close.
SAM (CONT'D) I had lunch with Craig today.
CHARLIE Yeah?
SAM He said he was sorry, and that I was right to break up with him.
SAM But I'm driving away, and I just felt so small.
SAM Just asking myself why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?
CHARLIE We accept the love we think we deserve.
CHARLIE He says it sober.
CHARLIE Without judgement.
CHARLIE Sam lets it sink in.
CHARLIE Charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing.
CHARLIE Then, she turns to him.
SAM Then, why didn't you ever ask me out?
Charlie didn't expect that.
He is silent.
Heart pounding.
CHARLIE I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted that.
SAM Well, what did you want?
CHARLIE I just want you to be happy.
SAM Don't you get it, Charlie?
SAM I can't feel that.
SAM It's really sweet and everything, but you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love.
SAM I don't want to be somebody's crush.
SAM I want people to like the real me.
CHARLIE I know who you are, Sam.
Sam waits.
And Charlie finally speaks from the heart.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I know I'm quiet, and I know I should speak more, but if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time, you'd know what it really meant.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) How much we are alike.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) And how we've been through the same things.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) And you're not small.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) You're beautiful.
He can't contain himself anymore.
He moves to her and kisses her.
They stand.
Move to the bed.
Kissing.
Charlie's heart pounds.
They sit on the bed.
Still kissing.
We see her fingertips.
Her hand on Charlie's knee.
When she touches him, Charlie pulls away from her.
Shocked.
Like he's seen a ghost.
It hits Charlie like freezing water.
SAM What's wrong, Charlie?
CHARLIE Oh, ah...
CHARLIE nothing.
Charlie shakes off whatever was bothering him and continues
It's like a dream for Charlie.
He watches Sam hug Alice and Mary Elizabeth goodbye.
But Charlie is somewhere else.
SAM I'll call all the time.
MARY ELIZABETH Promise.
SAM And we'll all see each other in New York.
SAM'S MOM Come on, Sam.
SAM'S MOM Charlie can't take it.
SAM'S MOM He moves to the side of the truck and puts in the last suitcase.
SAM'S MOM He looks over at Sam.
QUICK FLASH...
Charlie remembers kissing Sam the night before.
Her hand touches Charlie's knee.
Charlie snaps himself out of it.
He turns back as Mary Elizabeth and Alice part ways.
Charlie locks eyes with Sam.
They take a moment.
And then they come together to hug.
She kisses him goodbye, trying not to cry.
After a moment, Sam climbs into the driver's seat of her truck with Patrick riding shotgun.
Charlie looks dazed.
QUICK FLASH...
Charlie remembers pulling away from Sam.
Shocked.
Like he's seen a ghost.
SAM What's wrong, Charlie?
Sam starts the truck.
Charlie wants to scream for her to stop.
But he's frozen.
She drives away.
He watches her go.
The truck gets smaller in the distance until it turns at the stop sign.
And disappears.
Charlie stands there, alone.
QUICK FLASH...
Charlie remembers the night with Sam.
We see her put her hand on his knee.
The image moves up the arm.
To the shoulder.
To the face.
And we reveal, we are not in Sam's bedroom.
And it is not Sam touching Charlie.
But...
Aunt Helen
AUNT HELEN Don't wake your sister.
The memory only registers as a small blink of his eye.
Charlie sees his friends are crying.
He's not.
He's numb.
Charlie walks down the street.
His eyes far away.
The images and memories are short, violent bursts.
If you've never had an anxiety attack, this is how it feels.
QUICK FLASH.
It's Christmas Eve.
Aunt Helen smiles to Little Charlie.
AUNT HELEN It'll be our little secret, okay?
AUNT HELEN Little Charlie nods.
BACK TO PRESENT.
Charlie walks toward us on the sidewalk.
We see him through a long lens.
His image fractures.
We see him in different planes of the image.
He's beginning to break apart.
One image.
Two images.
QUICK FLASH.
Little Candace is asleep on the floor.
Aunt Helen sits next to Little Charlie on the sofa.
AUNT HELEN Look, Charlie.
AUNT HELEN She's fast asleep.
BACK TO PRESENT.
We see Charlie fracturing.
The pieces scattered.
Out of focus.
Lost.
He's all over the frame.
QUICK FLASH.
Aunt Helen points to Little Candace.
AUNT HELEN Don't wake your sister.
BACK TO PRESENT.
Charlie enters his house.
QUICK FLASH.
Aunt Helen gets hit by the semi-truck.
QUICK FLASH.
Little Charlie's mom opens the door to reveal a policeman.
BACK TO PRESENT.
Charlie is in the same entry hall in the same house 8 years later.
Banging his head against the wall.
"It's my fault.
It's all my fault."
He passes the photo wall on the stairs.
We see the images of the family.
Church.
Communion.
Baby pictures.
Years of history staring at us.
Ghosts on the wall.
BACK TO PRESENT.
Charlie sits at his desk.
We see him from behind.
Perfectly still.
Trying to keep himself calm.
CHARLIE Stop crying.
QUICK FLASH.
Charlie thinks everyone is staring at him.
His sister and her friends.
His brother and mother.
Mary Elizabeth and Alice.
And worst of all...
Sam and Patrick the night they toasted him.
A paranoid nightmare.
BACK TO PRESENT.
Charlie's falling to pieces.
The tears run down his face.
CHARLIE Stop crying.
QUICK FLASH.
Derek hits Candace.
Patrick hits Brad.
The cafeteria erupts into violence.
And Charlie remembers what he's blacked out.
We see him in the cafeteria.
Terrifying.
He thinks he sees Aunt Helen as he breaks the Linebacker's nose.
Hits another in the throat.
And pushes another.
Charlie looks at his hand, covered in blood.
The whole school staring at him.
BACK TO PRESENT.
Charlie holds his head.
Trying to stuff the pictures back in his brain.
But he can't.
They keep coming and coming, faster and faster.
Sam's hand, Little Charlie on top of the stairs, the police telling him Aunt Helen is dead.
CHARLIE (V.O.) It'll be our little secret.
CHARLIE (V.O.) We go behind his head.
CHARLIE (V.O.) The image moves closer and closer.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Until it feels like we are inside Charlie's mind.
We see Candace hanging out with her girlfriends at a friend's backyard pool.
Her FRIEND (18, pretty) holds the cordless.
CANDACE'S FRIEND Candace...
CANDACE'S FRIEND your brother's on the phone.
CANDACE'S FRIEND Candace casually picks up the phone.
CANDACE Hello.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Hey, Candace.
CANDACE Charlie?
CHARLIE Sam and Patrick left, and um, I just can't stop thinking something.
CANDACE What?
CHARLIE Candace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I?
CHARLIE She died getting my birthday present, so I guess I killed her, right?
CHARLIE I've tried to stop thinking that, but I can't.
CHARLIE She keeps driving away and dying over and over.
CHARLIE Candace looks like she got hit with ice water.
CHARLIE She knows her brother.
CHARLIE She knows this voice.
CHARLIE Candace covers the phone.
CANDACE Call the police and send them to my house.
CHARLIE And I can't stop her.
CHARLIE I'm crazy again.
CANDACE No, Charlie, listen to me.
CANDACE Mom and dad are going to be home with Chris any second.
CHARLIE I was just thinking...
CHARLIE what if I wanted her to die, Candace?
CANDACE What?
CANDACE Charlie...
CANDACE Charlie!
CANDACE Dial tone.
We begin in the house.
It's silent.
The hallway.
The entry hall.
The empty bedroom.
Charlie's typewriter on his desk.
88. It's all so quiet.
88. And then, we see Charlie walking down the hallway.
88. He turns the corner and enters the...
Kitchen.
One room.
Charlie doesn't know where he is anymore.
The past and present have bled together.
QUICK FLASH.
We see Little Charlie turn the corner into the kitchen.
BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old Charlie stands in the same kitchen, breathing shallow.
QUICK FLASH.
7 year old Charlie walks up to Aunt Helen sitting at the kitchen table.
BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old Charlie begins to have a full blown anxiety attack.
QUICK FLASH.
7 year old Charlie takes Aunt Helen's hand and turns it over...
to reveal her wrist scars.
BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie looks from the table to the counter with the bread and the KNIVES.
He stares at the knives for a moment.
Just as...
The Policemen break down the door.
We see Charlie's reflection in the window.
The door opens slowly, and his psychiatrist, Dr. Burton, enters.
She finds him sitting in the corner.
He has been crying.
DR. BURTON Charlie?
DR. BURTON I'm Dr. Burton.
CHARLIE Where am I?
DR. BURTON Mayview hospital.
DR. BURTON This news hits Charlie hard.
DR. BURTON He begins to panic.
CHARLIE You have to let me go.
CHARLIE My dad can't afford it.
DR. BURTON Don't worry about that.
CHARLIE No.
CHARLIE I saw them when I was little.
CHARLIE And I don't want to be a Mayview kid.
CHARLIE Just tell me how to stop it.
DR. BURTON Stop what?
CHARLIE Seeing it.
CHARLIE All their lives.
CHARLIE All the time.
CHARLIE Just...
CHARLIE how do you stop seeing it?
DR. BURTON Seeing what, Charlie?
Charlie breaks.
CHARLIE There is so much pain.
CHARLIE And I don't know how to not notice it.
DR. BURTON What's hurting you?
CHARLIE No!
CHARLIE Not me.
CHARLIE It's them.
CHARLIE It's everyone.
CHARLIE It never stops.
CHARLIE Do you understand?
Dr. Burton smiles, sympathetic.
Charlie nods, relieved that someone finally understands.
Until...
DR. BURTON What about your Aunt Helen?
Like cold water.
What was tears is now confusion and soon to be shame.
Dr. Burton is gentle to him.
CHARLIE What about her?
DR. BURTON Can you see her?
CHARLIE Yes, she had a terrible life.
CHARLIE But...
CHARLIE I mean, what am I...
DR. BURTON You said some things about her in your sleep.
CHARLIE I don't care.
DR. BURTON If you want to get better, you have to--
DR. BURTON Charlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement.
CHARLIE She was...
CHARLIE insane.
CHARLIE The minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed.
CHARLIE He stops talking.
CHARLIE Dr. Burton does not press him.
CHARLIE Not today.
DR. BURTON Charlie, are you going to let me help you here?
DR. BURTON Charlie cries and nods.
CHARLIE Okay.
DR. BURTON Do you remember anything before you blacked out?
CHARLIE I, uh...
CHARLIE I remember leaving Sam's house, and walking home...
CHARLIE We move away from them as Charlie's voice trails off.
The sun creeps through the windows.
We can hear birds outside.
The intercom is quiet.
Charlie is alone.
He looks at Sam's typewriter.
"Dear Friend" is already typed.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I was in the hospital for awhile.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I won't go into detail about all of it.
CHARLIE (V.O.) But I will say there were some very bad days.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And some unexpected beautiful days.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Charlie picks up a get well card from Sam.
Dr. Burton walks Charlie's parents down the hallway.
CHARLIE (V.O.) The worst day was the time my doctor told my mom and dad what Aunt Helen did to me.
CHARLIE (V.O.) In the distance, we see Charlie's mom and dad stop.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Shocked.
Charlie looks up and sees his mom and dad in the doorway.
MOTHER Honey?
MOTHER His mother comes to hold him.
MOTHER (CONT'D) I'm so sorry.
MOTHER (CONT'D) For a second, we see the emotion his father hides behind the sports page, before he chokes it down.
MOTHER (CONT'D) He walks over to his son and kisses his forehead.
Charlie, Chris, and Candace sit on the bed, playing cards.
CHARLIE (V.O.) The best days were those when I could have visitors.
CHARLIE (V.O.) My brother and sister always came for those until Chris had to go to training camp.
CHARLIE (V.O.) He's going to be first string this year.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job.
Charlie leaves his room with his suitcase in hand.
His mother waits in the hallway with Dr. Burton.
DR. BURTON There he is.
DR. BURTON So, I'll see you Thursday at 6, right?
DR. BURTON Charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother.
CHARLIE (V.O.) My doctor said we can't choose where we can come from, but we can choose where we go from there.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I know it's not all the answers, but it was enough to start putting these pieces together.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Dr. Burton smiles, then turns back into the hospital.
The family sits at the dinner table.
FATHER God bless this food that we are about to receive.
FATHER We thank You for this bounty in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
FATHER Amen.
FATHER After they say "Amen," the room falls silent.
FATHER The family is on pins and needles.
FATHER No one touches their food.
FATHER Until...
CHARLIE How do you think the Penguins are going to do this year, dad?
FATHER God damn Penguins.
FATHER I think they're allergic to God damn defense.
CHARLIE What do the players call a puck again?
FATHER A biscuit.
CANDACE Are you sure it's not a "God damn biscuit?"
FATHER You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
FATHER As things return to normal, dad picks up his paper.
FATHER Candace talks about the books she'll need for college.
FATHER Everyone starts eating.
FATHER And Charlie smiles, happy to just be home.
Ding dong.
The door opens to reveal Patrick, smiling.
PATRICK Can Charlie come out and play?
PATRICK Charlie's mother smiles.
PATRICK Charlie smiles, too.
PATRICK Especially when he sees...
PATRICK Sam.
PATRICK Standing next to Patrick.
PATRICK Her hair a little different.
PATRICK Her eyes alive and happy.
The gang of three sit at their booth.
Sam and Patrick have their coffee.
Charlie has his brownie.
Like always.
SAM That first night, I had grilled stickies.
SAM It was so good.
SAM You have to visit in the Fall.
SAM We'll have some.
SAM Okay?
CHARLIE Definitely.
PATRICK Sorry, Sam.
PATRICK Charlie has a breakdown scheduled for October.
PATRICK Charlie laughs.
PATRICK Sam smiles.
PATRICK After a beat...
SAM Well, can I tell you something?
SAM I've been away for two months.
SAM It's another world.
SAM And it gets better.
SAM And my roommate Katie has the best taste in music.
SAM Sam puts a cassette tape down on the table.
SAM (CONT'D) I found the tunnel song.
SAM (CONT'D) Charlie looks at Sam and Patrick, who smile.
SAM (CONT'D) Let's drive.
The three leave the restaurant and jump into Sam's truck.
Patrick drives.
Charlie in the middle.
Sam the passenger.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters because I might be too busy trying to participate.
CHARLIE (V.O.) So, if this does end up being the last letter, I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And you helped me.
The three friends are flying down the highway in Sam's truck.
The music blaring.
The wind making their hair dance.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Even if you didn't know what I was talking about.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Or know someone who's gone through it.
CHARLIE (V.O.) It made me not feel alone.
CHARLIE (V.O.) With Sam's help, Charlie climbs through the little window
Charlie gets into the back of the truck.
He sits down, looking back at the highway.
Watching everywhere he's been.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Because I know there are people who say all of these things don't happen.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.
CHARLIE (V.O.) We see Charlie in profile.
CHARLIE (V.O.) The night sky behind him until...
...
they enter the tunnel, and we realize just how fast they're driving.
The white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at blinding speed.
A perfect night.
A perfect drive.
Flying.
CHARLIE (V.O.) I know these will all be stories someday.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And our pictures will become old photographs.
CHARLIE (V.O.) And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad.
CHARLIE (V.O.) But right now, these moments are not stories.
CHARLIE (V.O.) Charlie turns to face forward.
CHARLIE (V.O.) To the moment.
CHARLIE (V.O.) To Sam, smiling at him from the front seat.
CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D) This is happening.
CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D) I am here.
CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D) And I am looking at her.
CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D) And she is so beautiful.
CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D) Sam kisses Charlie.
CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D) Then, she turns, and all three kids look ahead to everything in front of them.
CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D) Charlie begins to stand in the back of the truck.
CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D) Ready to leave the tunnel.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I can see it.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) This one moment when you know you're not a sad story.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) You are alive.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And as you stand up and see the lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And you are listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Charlie stands in the back of the truck.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) The wind on his face.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) He is free.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And in this moment, I swear...
We see the moment as Charlie sees it.
The tunnel's exit getting bigger and brighter with the lights of the city behind it.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) we are infinite.
The tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies out of the tunnel.
Sam and Patrick scream with excitement.
Charlie holds his arms in the air.
The weight of the world gone.
If only for a moment.
This one moment.
We see the city.
A million lights like white stars in a glass dome.
We crane to the sky.
We are in Heaven.
