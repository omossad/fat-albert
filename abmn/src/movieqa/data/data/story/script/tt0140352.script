<u>THE  INSIDER</u>
written by
ERIC ROTH & MICHAEL MANN
All we can see is black filling the screen...
Black on black...
And we're in a speeding SOVIET JEEP...
Two men in front, shouldering assault rifles.
HEZBOLLAH SOLDIERS...
And there are three MEN in the back.
A middle-aged Man wearing a tired suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on.
And on either side of him, two Men, blindfolded.
The man on one side is in his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled black-leather jacket...
A stocky man, with the edge of a J.D.
Salinger character, he's seen everything at least once.
But even he has lost some of his self-confidence, here, turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of Arabic music that disappears behind him...
He's LOWELL BERGMAN.
On the other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky Man with a voltmeter around his neck, NORMAN.
The Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese village.
It's shadowed by a Jeep in front, and in back, each carrying personnel armed with AK's and a few RPG's...
And in the third Jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening Lebanese soldiers.
And as the speeding convoy passes a captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with Arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Hezbollah religious leader, the Sheikh Fadlallah...
And, suddenly the convoy skids to a stop...
And blindfolded Lowell and Norman are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the cloud of dust without sight...
The lanky cameraman is stopped, told to wait, while Lowell is pushed past armed men guarding a small stone house, and inside...
A round-faced Man in his mid-forties, with large-framed glasses, black hair and a grey-black beard, wearing a dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table...
It's the Sheikh Fadlallah whose face stares out at us from walls.
A Gunman cradling an AK-47 sits in an incongruous purple armchair in a corner.
A torn poster of the Seychelles is on one wall.
Another Gunman stands by a window.
Lowell is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table...
THE SHEIKH Coffee?
LOWELL Yeah...
LOWELL Thank you.
THE SHEIKH How have you liked your stay?
LOWELL What I've <u>seen</u>...I've liked.
The Sheikh smiles.
And the smile passes as quickly as it came.
A steaming cup of coffee in a small Arabic demitasse is put down.
THE SHEIKH Please to explain, why I should agree to interview...with pro-Zionist American media?
LOWELL Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now.
LOWELL So you care about what you're thought of in America.
LOWELL And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.
LOWELL That's why.
And we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come here voluntarily.
THE SHEIKH Perhaps you <u>prove</u> journalism <u>objectivity</u> and I see the questions first.
THE SHEIKH Then I decide if I grant the interview.
LOWELL No.
LOWELL We don't do that.
LOWELL You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace.
LOWELL So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity.
LOWELL You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
The Sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him, studying him.
And Lowell "closes":
LOWELL (cont'd) So.
LOWELL (cont'd) Mr. Wallace.
LOWELL (cont'd) Should he get on a plane or not?
The Sheikh thinks it over and then...
THE SHEIKH Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
LOWELL That's good.
LOWELL That works.
LOWELL Uh, you know, I want to ask you something...I know it sounds odd...but...
It's quiet...too quiet...
LOWELL (CONT'D) Hello, Sheikh...?
LOWELL (CONT'D) Hello, Sheikh...?
Silence.
He hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold...
He lifts it.
And he sees the Sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone.
The house empty.
Only his Cameraman, the lanky man, left there, standing by the door still in his blindfold...
LOWELL (CONT'D) Norman.
NORMAN What?
NORMAN What?
LOWELL Take your blindfold off.
The lanky man does and we see the cameraman is Asian- American.
LOWELL (CONT'D) Welcome to the world.
Norman gives Lowell an ironic look and tests the local current at an electrical outlet.
NORMAN Fluctuating all over the place.
NORMAN Anywhere we shoot, here, it's gonna be portable gennies and we'll run cable...
Lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding height.
Baalbek and the Beqa'a Valley below gold-domed mosques.
A moment of triumph.
He dials his cell phone...
MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) Hello?
LOWELL Mike, it's me.
LOWELL We're on...
We're in a SCIENCE LABORATORY...
OUT OF FOCUS LAB TECHNICIANS, in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset Black woman's birthday...
Half her presents are opened.
Balloons, incongruous, floating above the lab...
And there's a sense that somebody is watching...
And from the waist up, a disembodied figure comes into FOCUS behind a glass partition, as if quarantined, isolated, an expressionless MAN in his late forties, watching them...
The office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing, their lips moving.
His hair not yet settled on grey, his face is changing, always interesting.
Born in the Bronx, educated in Upstate New York, he retains little of the accent and much of the directness.
He's JEFFREY WIGAND.
He turns to resume gathering things from his desk...some technical books, a medical text on asthma...putting them in his briefcase.
And as he leaves the office, the silent party like a bizarre mime behind him...
Briefcase in hand, Jeffrey appears from the elevator from ABOVE, from WIDE and in FRONT, his eyes, frozen pools...
And like a bad dream, a broad-shouldered Man, leaning against the wall near the reception island in a suit he's not comfortable in, wearing an earphone, saying something into a lapel microphone after Jeffrey's passed.
Light mottled through trees reflects off the car window...
Jeffrey's face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and shadow...down this tasteful, suburban Louisville street of neat houses and manicured lawns...
He pulls into driveway behind a 3 series BMW.
It's a grey French provincial replica...
Jeffrey comes in and a young Girl, six, is watching television in the den...BARBARA.
WIGAND Hi, honey.
BARBARA Hi, Daddy.
WIGAND What's new?
BARBARA Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
WIGAND Yeah?
WIGAND What for?
BARBARA For reading.
He pours himself a drink at a wet bar.
WIGAND That's great...
WIGAND Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
BARBARA Okay.
Dutiful, she shuts off the TV, going upstairs.
BARBARA (cont'd) Deborah?
BARBARA (cont'd) Debbie?
He looks outside.
A Woman is sitting on the back porch drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine.
There's something like a Hockney painting about her against the manicured lawns.
Right now the Woman comes in.
She's pretty, tall, languid, reserved, somebody it would be nice to wear on your arm.
LIANE WIGAND.
She has an odd delay between a thought and her speech...
LIANE Oh, I didn't know you were home...
LIANE It's early...
LIANE Isn't it?
He doesn't say anything...
LIANE (CONT'D) Gotta take Debbie to ballet...
And it all feels suburban, familiar.
Suddenly there's a shout...
BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER) Mommy!
Jeffrey goes quickly up the stairs into...
And a little girl, eight, sitting on the floor in a ballet leotard, her head back, wheezing, her neck muscles contracting and bulging, her face pale, lips white, and her eyes filled with fear as rapid, shallow breathing induces a sense of suffocation.
DEBORAH WIGAND is having a severe asthmatic attack...
WIGAND Sweetheart, c'mon.
WIGAND C'mon.
BARBARA She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
Jeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a Nebulizer, an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube into a circular mouthpiece.
The compressor whirs.
Deborah breathes in the medication.
Jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes perspiration from her forehead as...
WIGAND Slow down.
WIGAND Slow down.
WIGAND Slow down.
WIGAND Breathe deep.
WIGAND Breathe deep.
WIGAND Slow down, honey.
WIGAND Slow down.
WIGAND Slow down.
Liane rushes in with rolled-up towels, kneels in front of Deborah, smiling to mask anxiety, and goes into the bathroom with the towels and turns on full blast the bathtub's hot water.
We don't know why yet...
Deborah's chest heaves.
She's scared.
Jeffrey gets in front of her and talks to her to arrest her attention.
WIGAND (cont'd) Here we go.
WIGAND (cont'd) Deep breaths, deep breaths.
BARBARA She was playing with the Pooh doll.
WIGAND Pooh's dusty, sweetheart...he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay?
WIGAND So what's - what's happening to you now is...
WIGAND cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in."
WIGAND ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches.
WIGAND And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack.
WIGAND And, we give you medicine, and you get better.
WIGAND Huh?
WIGAND Okay?
WIGAND You're better already, aren't you?
And the medication's taking effect and she's calmer.
Liane, hands clutched in her lap, smiles at Deborah.
Now she takes Deborah's hand and exchanges a look with Jeffrey.
Jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver.
WIGAND (cont'd) Okay, baby?
Jeffrey, Liane and the two Girls silently eating dinner, Deborah in a bathrobe.
DEBORAH Can I go to dance <u>tomorrow</u>?
DEBORAH I'm better...
LIANE ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
WIGAND I can take her.
LIANE Don't you have to be at the office?
WIGAND Is there any more rice...?
LIANE Yes, it's on the stove...
He goes into the kitchen, to the stove, seeing...
LIANE (cont'd) Do you want more rice?
DEBORAH Maybe later.
LIANE How about you?
BARBARA I'll take some.
WIGAND Instant rice...?
BARBARA Can I go over to Janeane's house?
LIANE I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
WIGAND Try the car.
And Liane going outside...
She opens Jeffrey's car looking in the front seat at the cup holders.
She turns to leave and sees the backseat filled with two boxes and the books we saw him take...
LIANE Uh, what are those boxes?
WIGAND I'm going to the store.
WIGAND You need anything?
LIANE What do you need at the store?
WIGAND Soy sauce...
LIANE Right now?
WIGAND That's my stuff from the office...
LIANE Why did you take your stuff from the office?
WIGAND I didn't want to leave it there...
LIANE I don't understand.
WIGAND I got fired this morning...
WIGAND Where else am I gonna take it?
LIANE Why?
LIANE Who said?
WIGAND Thomas Sandefur...
LIANE What are we supposed to do...?
LIANE What about our medical coverage; what about our health?
LIANE What about our car payments?
LIANE The payments on this house?
He looks at her.
There's an unspoken moment when it seems he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling...
But she doesn't and now there's a wall up and the moment passes...
WIGAND There's a severance agreement...
WIGAND It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...
WIGAND Sure you don't need anything?
LIANE No, thank you.
She's stunned.
He leaves.
And as Liane's completely still, her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she wants to ask how <u>he</u> is, how he must be feeling, and she turns into CAMERA towards him to do that.
But he's driven off down the street.
LIANE (cont'd) Jeffrey...!
The Sheikh, wearing a fresh white robe and skull cap, comes into the room...
THE SHEIKH I am very pleased to receive you as my guest, Mr. Wallace.
MIKE WALLACE Thank you for having us...
REVERSE: Norman's camera crew is setting up.
MIKE WALLACE is there.
A dangerous combination of intelligence, arrogance, and celebrity, there's a kinetic quality about him.
Wallace sits across from the Sheikh on a dais of patterned linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural of a French formal garden.
A Sound Technician wires the Sheikh and Mike with microphones.
Norman says something to Lowell and then goes out.
NORMAN I think I've got a problem with the gennie.
NORMAN I have to go outside.
LOWELL Norman...?
Mike turns his chair to face and slides it closer to the Sheikh's chair.
The Head Bodyguard barks something in Arabic.
The Interpreter says something back in Arabic.
The Sheikh, absorbed in his notes for the upcoming interview, ignores all of this.
INTERPRETER He says you must not sit so close.
MIKE WALLACE What?
MIKE WALLACE I can't conduct an interview from back there.
The Bodyguard, bristling at Wallace's tone, barks more confrontational Arabic.
INTERPRETER You must move back your chair.
MIKE WALLACE Will you tell him that when I conduct an interview, I sit anywhere I damn please!
INTERPRETER There is no interview.
As Mike leaps forward, moving inches from the Bodyguard's face with such sudden ferocity, even the Bodyguard flinches.
MIKE WALLACE You!
MIKE WALLACE I'm talking to you!
More armed men start to enter.
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) What the hell do you think I am?
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) A 78- year-old assassin?
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) You think I'm gonna karate him to death with this notepad?
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) Are you interpreting what I'm saying?
INTERPRETER Yes.
LOWELL We're there.
MIKE WALLACE Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
LOWELL Don't interpret that!
LOWELL Hold it.
LOWELL Hold it.
LOWELL Hold it!
LOWELL Slow, <u>slow</u>!!
LOWELL Sheikh, do you mind...if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr.
LOWELL Wallace?
The Sheikh looks up from his notes, nods, fixes his chair, goes back to his notes...
LOWELL (cont'd) Is that okay?
INTERPRETER Okay.
LOWELL Are you ready?
LOWELL Or you want to keep fucking around and warm up some more...?
MIKE WALLACE No.
MIKE WALLACE ...that's got my heart started.
They know each other well.
Lowell smiles.
Wallace sits down.
LOWELL Alright, Todd, give me the three-button on Mike, please.
LOWELL Okay.
LOWELL We are rolling.
LOWELL Okay, Mike.
They roll camera...
"60 Minutes"...
"Hezbollah"...
MIKE WALLACE Sheikh Fadlallah, thank you so <u>much</u> for seeing us.
MIKE WALLACE Are you a terrorist?
The Sheikh didn't expect the Mike Wallace opening shot between the eyes.
He recovers...
THE SHEIKH Mr. Wallace, I...am a servant of God.
That expression of incredulity...
MIKE WALLACE A servant of God?
MIKE WALLACE Really...
Mike, tipping his glasses down while the hostile Gunmen, cradling weapons, watch him through the doorway...
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) Americans believe that <u>you</u>, as an Islamic fundamentalist, that <u>you</u> are a leader who contributed to the bombing of the U.S.
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) Embassy.
The ballsiness of Wallace, asking <u>these</u> questions in <u>this</u> place, is impressive...
It's still.
A MAIL TRUCK is stopped at an odd angle in the street outside an older brick house with a bold redwood Big Sur-like fence on a hillside.
Beyond the truck is a forever view of the Bay.
A handle turns.
Mail truck door opens.
Mailman, carrying a box, going through the gate.
Doorstep.
Box is deposited there.
It's quiet again.
The BOX sitting nakedly by the front door...
Lowell, in sweat pants and an old tee shirt now, is on the telephone, still in bed...
Newspapers, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, San Francisco Chronicle, are spread all over...home as refuge.
A tray with large cups of coffee is on a side table.
LOWELL ...everyone thinks Canadian Mounties ride horses and rescue ladies from rapids, Mike.
LOWELL They backed locals in Oka in a fight with Mohawks over building a golf course on their burial site.
LOWELL They beat up protesters at Kanasake...
LOWELL Where'd you hear that?
The other phone on a nightstand rings...
A Woman in her forties, SHARON TILLER, enters, in a bathrobe, brushing her teeth.
She answers it...
LOWELL (cont'd) Oh, someone took a poll?
LOWELL (cont'd) "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
SHARON It's Stuart...he's in Mexico City...
LOWELL Let me call you back...
He takes up the line...listening...
LOWELL (CONT'D) Yeah, Stuart...
LOWELL (CONT'D) What New York bank?
A young Man in his early twenties wanders in...
JAKE Hey Dad...Sharon...
Lowell waves at JAKE, his son.
SHARON No classes this morning?
LOWELL Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
JAKE I don't have to be there until ten- thirty.
Lowell's son sits on the bed looking at part of a newspaper.
And another young Man, in his early twenties, with long hair comes strolling in, Sharon's son, JOSIAH.
JOSIAH Hi Mom, Lowell...
Lowell, still on the phone, waves to him.
SHARON Hi, sweetheart...
Josiah sits on the bed too, reading the back of the sports section Jake is reading...
Another line rings, Sharon getting it.
The Boys, used to them, get up, and leave...
LOWELL Will independent sources corroborate that?
SHARON Hello?
SHARON Yeah...
The Boys coming out of the house together...
And seeing the BOX by the door...
LOWELL'S SON Dad, you got a box out here...
And they go out the gate, talking, walking off along the Berkeley street.
The box left waiting by the door.
LOWELL Let me see this...
LOWELL No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
SHARON I can't...
SHARON I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
Lowell comes with the box back to bed.
He's already unwrapped it.
Inside are stacks of papers...
He looks at the box cover.
No return address.
An anonymous sender; not unusual for him.
He casually looks through the papers.
SHARON (CONT'D) Two p.m.
SHARON (CONT'D) Great.
SHARON (CONT'D) Bye-bye.
LOWELL ..."
LOWELL ignition propensity?"
LOWELL ...you understand any of this...?
He gives her some papers.
We see formulas...scientific data in tables...
SHARON ...no...this looks like a table of temperatures...
SHARON Who's this from?
LOWELL ...it's anonymous.
LOWELL References to "P.M."
LOWELL It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
SHARON I have to take a shower.
As he looks at the papers, Sharon goes into the bathroom...
We see a MAN in his forties, eating a late lunch, getting paged in a crowded cafeteria.
An old 1930's WPA mural on the wall...
His pager goes off...
Doug Oliver walks across the cafeteria to a bank of pay phones and dials.
The phone rings.
Lowell picks it up...
LOWELL Yeah.
DOUG OLIVER Hi, this is Doug Oliver...
LOWELL Oh, hi, Doug...it's Lowell.
LOWELL I'm doing this story on fire safety...
LOWELL People burning up from falling asleep smoking.
LOWELL I received a shitload of scientific papers from inside Philip Morris...
LOWELL Anonymous.
LOWELL You or anybody in FDA know someone who can translate this stuff into English for me?
DOUG OLIVER ...uh, yeah...
There's the sound of a phone ringing.
PULL BACK to reveal Lowell outside a cafe with dry cleaning he collected over one shoulder.
A LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE OVER (Deborah's) answers.
"Hello."
LOWELL Mr. Wigand, please.
There's a whisper..."
Someone's calling for Daddy, Mom."
Behind Lowell is a humming Berkeley street.
He gestures familiarly to a Server, who brings out his two take-out cappuccinos.
Lowell nods his thanks, pays...
LOWELL (cont'd) Thank you, Bob.
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER) Who's calling?
LOWELL My name's Lowell Bergman...
LOWELL I'm --
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER) Did you say Berman?
LOWELL No, Bergman...B.E.R.G.M.A.N....
LOWELL I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER) "60 Minutes"?
LOWELL Yeah.
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER) "60 Minutes," the television show?
LOWELL Yes.
Lowell waits for some moments, and...
LIANE He doesn't want to talk to you.
LOWELL How does he know he doesn't want to talk to me?
LOWELL He doesn't know what I'm calling him about...
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER) He doesn't care to know.
And she hangs up.
Lowell's motionless...
And his interest piqued, he sets down his cleaning.
He calls back...
The phone rings and rings...
A MACHINE picks it up...
Jeffrey Wigand's Voice: "This is the Wigands'...
If you'd like to leave a message or send a fax, start now..."
And we see Jeffrey Wigand, sitting at his desk in his office, working on his computer, hearing Lowell...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) This is Lowell Bergman with "60 Minutes"...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) I'm doing a story on fire safety and cigarettes...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) I have scientific documents from a tobacco company, and I could use your help as a consultant explaining these documents to me...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) My number is area code 510-555- 0199...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) I'll be there, at this number, in 10 minutes.
He hangs up.
Jeffrey doesn't react, quietly working on his computer.
Lowell's restless, waiting...
And not getting a call back, he tries another tact.
He writes a FAX, "Please call me at..."
He writes his number down.
He sends the Fax.
He's still.
It's quiet.
And not getting an answer he gets up, starting to leave the room.
And suddenly the fax machine RINGS...
He turns.
He reads a message emerging from the machine..."
I can't talk to you..."
He's quiet.
He writes on a piece of paper..."
Can't talk to me?" "Won't talk to me?" "Don't want to talk to me...?" As he faxes it back...
Wigand reading the return fax from Lowell...
Lowell, waiting...
The fax machine rings again...
He reads Jeffrey's answer.
"Can't."
"Won't."
"Don't want to..."
He's quiet, more than just interested, now.
There's something beyond intriguing here.
He turns.
He looks through a stack of phone books for something...a nationwide 800 directory.
He looks through it and dials Wigand's phone number again...
LOWELL If you're curious to meet me...
Wigand working on his computer...
Lowell's VOICE on his answering machine...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) ...I'm gonna be in the lobby of the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, reading The New York Times, tomorrow, at five o'clock...
Lowell clicks off.
And as Wigand sits at his computer, giving no indication what he might do...
An old hotel with faded carpets.
Lowell in the lobby reading a New York Times, waiting...
And instead of looking up every time somebody passes, he looks down at people's shoes.
A pair of black wing tips walking by...
A woman's high heels...
A pair of men's tasseled loafers.
A lace-up brown.
A pair of tennis shoes.
A cordovan wing tip.
The pair of tasseled loafers walking by again...
And Lowell looks up...
And the Man in the tasseled loafers, turns away...
It's Jeffrey Wigand in a suit and a tie with a Fortune 500, corporate-executive bearing...
Lowell crosses to the elevators.
Wigand looks around the lobby and follows Lowell in, and as the doors close...
LOWELL (OVER) Have you always lived in Louisville?
Brilliant late afternoon sunlight.
We PULL BACK to see Jeffrey, standing by a window, silently looking outside to the left...
Lowell, cool, waiting, hands in his pockets, in the middle of the large room...
WIGAND Mr. Bergman?
WIGAND What did you want me to consult about?
A sudden KNOCK on the door...
WIGAND (CONT'D) Who's that?
LOWELL That's room service.
LOWELL They usually knock first.
LOWELL Come on in...
LOWELL Over here, please.
Room Service brings in a tray with coffee.
As Lowell signs the bill, the Room Service Waiter waiting, looks at Wigand...
Their eyes meet...
The Waiter looks away.
LOWELL (cont'd) Thank you.
And the Waiter leaves...
LOWELL (CONT'D) How do you like your coffee?
LOWELL (CONT'D) Black?
WIGAND Black, black...
Lowell gives him his cup of coffee.
WIGAND (CONT'D) Look, I really don't have that much time...
LOWELL Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
WIGAND Like what?
WIGAND Your sign?
Lowell smiles.
WIGAND (CONT'D) I know what I have to know.
LOWELL Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
WIGAND How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
Lowell looks at him, he does his homework...
LOWELL I still do the tough stories.
LOWELL "60 Minutes" reaches a lot of people.
Wigand's quiet, measuring him.
WIGAND Let me see the documents...
Lowell gives him the box of papers...
Wigand sits down, the box on his lap, quietly looking through them...flips to a different heading, consults a chart...
WIGAND (CONT'D) ...this is a Fire-Safety Product Study for Philip Morris.
WIGAND (CONT'D) Burn rates...ignition propensity...things of this nature.
WIGAND (CONT'D) I could very easily explain this to you in layman's terms, because it's from another company...
He puts the papers down...
WIGAND (cont'd) ...but that's as far as I go...
LOWELL Far as you go where?
WIGAND This issue is a drop in the bucket.
WIGAND I can talk to you about what's in here.
WIGAND But I can't talk to you about anything else.
And Lowell knows something else is going on here...
WIGAND (CONT'D) I signed a confidentiality agreement.
WIGAND (CONT'D) I honor agreements...
A lot more is going on here...
Lowell nods, a good reporter...
WIGAND (CONT'D) Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
LOWELL Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do...but I don't take that seriously.
LOWELL Where do you work?
WIGAND Did work.
LOWELL Did work.
WIGAND How much would I get paid?
LOWELL That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs.
LOWELL But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Wigand nods "Okay."
WIGAND Should I just take the documents now?
LOWELL If you want to do it.
He turns to leave...
Lowell gets the door for him...
Wigand momentarily slows...
WIGAND I worked as the head of Research and Development for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.
WIGAND I was a Corporate Vice President.
WIGAND Mr. Bergman...
And he goes out the door...
Lowell's still.
Wigand's job title resonates.
Lowell turns to the window, casually looking into the early evening...and he comes face to face with what Wigand was staring at, The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company Headquarters Building, lit up right across the street...
MIKE WALLACE "President Assad of Syria said that difficult obstacles remain but that his country, quote, 'looks forward to a great, long peace with Israel.'"
TAIL LEADER.
THEN BLACK.
Suddenly lights come on.
Executive Producer DON HEWITT is suddenly on his feet.
A veritable dervish, in constant motion...
DON HEWITT It's a Peabody, Mike.
DON HEWITT When you're dead and buried, Hezbollah is the one they're gonna remember you for...
Mike, used to him, ignores him, getting up, turning to leave, Hewitt on his tail...while...
LOWELL ...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
MIKE WALLACE You eating with us?
LOWELL Yeah.
MIKE WALLACE Bring a tie so they'll let us in the <u>front</u> door...
And Lowell gestures for an olive-skinned Woman in her late thirties, Lowell's assistant, DEBBIE DELUCA, to join them.
The eye contact on the way out says there's something important he needs to tell her...
There's a blast of NOISE.
The City.
Lowell, Wallace, Hewitt, Debbie, enter from the CBS lobby, moving through the reflections.
Lowell is about to say something to Debbie, but BILL FELLING, Evening News' Assignment Editor, coming the other way...
LOWELL Debbie...
FELLING Hey, Lowell.
Midstream, fast:
LOWELL Oh, Bill...
LOWELL Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank.
LOWELL Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch.
LOWELL You want it for the Evening News?
FELLING What about you, you got a crew already?
LOWELL I'm gonna do a follow-up.
FELLING Okay.
LOWELL Catch ya' later.
Lowell, crossing...
LOWELL Debbie...
And, now, as they cross Madison...
LOWELL (CONT'D) I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS.
LOWELL (CONT'D) Boundaries of their constraint.
LOWELL (CONT'D) Kentucky state law about.
LOWELL (CONT'D) I want you to drop everything.
DEBBIE DELUCA Okay.
Hewitt stops to buy a newspaper.
He doesn't have change, Debbie does.
And Mike, Lowell and Don bang into Michael's restaurant.
We SEE them through the glass, being greeted, people shaking their hands, escorted by the maitre d' to their table as...
Meanwhile, it's static.
Still, frozen.
Jeffrey sits in the RECEPTION AREA of The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company headquarters.
Complimentary cigarettes are arranged on tables.
A dark quiet.
The hush of big business.
Standing in the background by a wall next to the banks of elevators, is an ever-present Man, another one, with an earphone and lapel microphone...
UNIFORMED SECURITY Mr. Wigand, you can go up now...
He gets up, crossing to an elevator.
THOMAS SANDEFUR Sorry.
THOMAS SANDEFUR I'm accepting an award from the Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation.
THOMAS SANDEFUR It's going to kill the rest of my day.
THOMAS SANDEFUR is absorbed in spreadsheets of regional sales figures.
Dark pouches are under his eyes.
He doesn't look up.
He doesn't look healthy.
We're in a luxurious office with a view of Louisville.
Jeffrey is waiting in a chair.
Sandefur is Brown & Williamson's CEO.
Two LAWYERS, their briefcases, like weapons, close at hand, sit on a couch.
Their jackets are off.
They wear expensive shirts.
THOMAS SANDEFUR (cont'd) So.
THOMAS SANDEFUR (cont'd) You had a chance to play golf?
Surprisingly affable, Sandefur prides himself on his salesman's sunny manners.
He has a mellifluous Georgia accent...
THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D) Jeff's a premiere golfer...
THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D) What are you, a two handicap?
WIGAND Seven...
THOMAS SANDEFUR And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us.
THOMAS SANDEFUR He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met.
THOMAS SANDEFUR It's spooky how he can concentrate.
WIGAND I'd rather play than talk about it.
WIGAND What did you want to see me about?
WIGAND I don't like being back here.
Sandefur smiles, used to him.
THOMAS SANDEFUR Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind.
THOMAS SANDEFUR Most people consider what they're saying...social skills...
THOMAS SANDEFUR Jeffrey just charges right ahead.
THOMAS SANDEFUR Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
WIGAND Chapter and verse.
THOMAS SANDEFUR Yeah, I know you do...
THOMAS SANDEFUR You know, I came up through sales.
THOMAS SANDEFUR One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep.
THOMAS SANDEFUR I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
And there's a warning behind it...
WIGAND Is that a threat?
THOMAS SANDEFUR ...we worked together for, what was it, three years...?
THOMAS SANDEFUR Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny...any more than are one's family matters...
WIGAND You threatening my family, now, too?
THOMAS SANDEFUR Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.
THOMAS SANDEFUR About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
WIGAND "Research..."
WIGAND You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
THOMAS SANDEFUR That's why we hire scientists...
WIGAND Okay.
WIGAND I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements.
WIGAND I was paid well for my work.
WIGAND The health and welfare benefits are good.
WIGAND The severance package is fair.
WIGAND I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
THOMAS SANDEFUR I appreciate all that, Jeff.
THOMAS SANDEFUR But, upon reflection...we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
And there's a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room...
THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D) So we've drafted a supplement to your agreement...it broadly defines and expands in more detail what is "confidential."
THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D) Nobody will be able to say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret, I didn't know that was a secret..."
THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D) We're very serious about protecting our interests.
THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D) We'd like you to sign it.
And he's acutely aware of the threat behind it...
WIGAND And if I don't?
A LAWYER If we "arrive" at the conclusion you're acting in bad faith?
A LAWYER We would terminate, right now, payouts under your severance package.
A LAWYER You and your family's medical benefits.
A LAWYER And initiate litigation against you, Mr. Wigand.
WIGAND <u>Dr</u>.
WIGAND Wigand.
A LAWYER <u>Dr</u>.
A LAWYER Wigand...after you've examined the document, you will see it is in your own best interest and you'll sign it.
Jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney.
And we see on his face the true nature of this man.
WIGAND So, what you are saying is: it isn't enough that you fired me.
WIGAND For no good reason!
WIGAND Now you question my integrity?
WIGAND On top of the humiliation of being fired?
WIGAND You threaten me?!
WIGAND You threaten my family?!
WIGAND It never crossed my mind not to honor my agreement...
WIGAND But I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur, and Brown & Williamson, too...
WIGAND Fuck me?
WIGAND Well, fuck you!!
And with that he gets up, and leaves...
And it's quiet...
A LAWYER I'm not sure he got the message...
THOMAS SANDEFUR Oh, I think he did.
Wigand picks up the phone and dials.
They've finished lunch.
Wallace and Hewitt are turned to talk to Sam Cohn and an older writer as suddenly Lowell's cell phone rings.
LOWELL Yeah...
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) ...you fucked me!
LOWELL Who is this?
WIGAND ...protect your sources...!
WIGAND You screwed me!
WIGAND You sold me out!
LOWELL What are you talking about?
LOWELL Where are you?
WIGAND Fuck you, too!
And he slams down the phone.
Lowell, holding the dead phone in his hand...
We see a brightly lit, golf driving range, empty, the wet grass under the lights vibrant, emerald green...
A caged cart, with one big yellow headlight, like some kind of strange insect, drives across the range, picking up golf balls.
And we see Jeffrey hitting golf balls, driving one after another, after another...
His swing is powerful, angry, a lone golfer, trying to chill out.
He pauses, spent.
Settling down, he exhales.
Then, he looks down the way...
And he slows...
He sees in the far distance, spot-lit, one other lone golfer, a Stocky Man, incongruously in a suit and tie, watching him...
And the Man in the suit right then, with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a golf ball...
The ball slamming into the steel net.
And the lights SUDDENLY go out.
The range closing for the night.
The "insect" comes to a stop.
And it's quiet, dark.
Jeffrey gathers up his clubs.
He crosses, his golf shoes, the metal cleats, clicking on the pavement, toward the PARKING LOT.
And there's the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind him.
He turns.
And the stocky Man in the suit, carrying a golf bag walking some distance behind him, staring at him.
Jeffrey comes to the parking lot.
It's empty.
Just Jeffrey's car, and despite all the empty spaces, another car, purposely or otherwise, parked right next to his.
He crosses to his car, getting in...
He drops the three clubs in the rear seat and settles behind the wheel.
He turns.
And he sees the Man in the suit has gotten in the car next to his.
They look at each other.
The Man, in no hurry, lights a cigarette, relaxes.
It's malevolent as hell.
And Jeffrey, suddenly, grabbing a golf club, jumps out of his car...
Golf club in hand at the driver side window...
WIGAND Stay away from me!
WIGAND You stay away from me!
The Man starts his car, and drives off nonplussed.
It's still.
And as Jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty parking lot, not knowing what's threatening him, something real, something imaginary...
A violent rain's falling.
And we see Jeffrey coming out of the house holding an umbrella over his little Girls.
They start towards the car.
There's the sound of a car door shutting.
Liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them...
LIANE Jeffrey, you forgot their lunches --
She slows, seeing someone.
Jeffrey turns: it's Lowell.
He's surprised.
LOWELL Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
WIGAND Jump in, quick, c'mon...
LOWELL I'm Lowell Bergman.
LOWELL We spoke on the phone, remember?
The Girls climb in the car.
Lowell crosses behind the Audi around the far side.
LOWELL (CONT'D) C'mere.
LOWELL (CONT'D) I want to talk to you.
WIGAND Good.
WIGAND I want to talk to you.
Jeff closes the door on his daughters and joins Lowell around the far side of the car.
WIGAND (CONT'D) What do...
LOWELL I did not burn you.
LOWELL I did not give you up to anyone!
WIGAND This is my house...
WIGAND In front of my wife, my kids?!
WIGAND What business do we have?
LOWELL To straighten something out with you.
LOWELL Right here.
LOWELL Right now.
WIGAND So, you didn't mention my name?
WIGAND You haven't talked to anybody about me?
LOWELL Why am I gonna mention your name?
WIGAND How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
LOWELL How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
WIGAND It <u>happened</u> after I talked to you.
WIGAND I do not like coincidences!
LOWELL And I don't like paranoid accusations!
LOWELL I'm a journalist.
LOWELL Think.
LOWELL Use your head.
LOWELL How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information <u>before</u> they provided me with it?
WIGAND You came all the way down here to tell me that?
LOWELL No.
LOWELL I did not.
LOWELL Big Tobacco is a big story.
LOWELL And you got something important to say.
LOWELL I can tell.
LOWELL But, yes.
LOWELL I did.
I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, <u>fuck</u> your story, I don't burn people.
It starts to rain harder.
They look at each other.
Jeffrey, without saying a word, gets in the Car.
He backs out.
Lowell, left standing in the driveway with Liane in the rain.
Liane goes back into the house.
And Lowell starts back across the street to his car.
There's a sound.
He turns.
Jeffrey's car, having gone around the corner, has come back and stopped in the street.
WIGAND Ride with me while I take the girls to school...
Lowell hesitates, then gets into the car in the back seat.
They drive away.
Lowell, incongruously sitting in the back seat with Barbara.
Jeffrey and Deborah in the front seat.
And it's quiet, just the sound of the wipers on the window.
And as Lowell rides with them...
We see the Car's parked in a weed-strewn empty lot.
Rain, pounding on it and the surface of the river beyond...
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) ...and my little girl has acute asthma...
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) Deborah.
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) My eldest daughter.
The Girls are gone.
We enter mid-scene.
Lowell's still in the back seat...
WIGAND (CONT'D) And, I'm unemployed.
WIGAND (CONT'D) So I have to protect my medical coverage.
WIGAND (CONT'D) ...so I left them a message this morning.
WIGAND (CONT'D) Their expanded confidentiality agreement?
WIGAND (CONT'D) I will sign it.
LOWELL They're afraid of you, aren't they?
WIGAND They should be.
The sound of the rain...
LOWELL Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
WIGAND Like what?
LOWELL Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
WIGAND Johnson & Johnson.
WIGAND Union Carbide in Japan.
WIGAND I was general manager and director of new products.
WIGAND I speak Japanese.
WIGAND I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer.
WIGAND All health- related.
WIGAND What else?
WIGAND Outside the "zone"...?
LOWELL I don't know...you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi-finals?
Wigand smiles...as their eyes meet in the rear view mirror.
A subtle connection...
It passes...
Jeff's car in the field, the giant Colgate-Palmolive clock behind.
The rain stopped.
Steam rises from the weed strewn empty lot.
Lowell's in the front seat.
And we get the feeling they've been talking for hours...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Just give me an example...
WIGAND For example.
WIGAND James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson...when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't <u>argue</u> with the FDA...
WIGAND He didn't even <u>wait</u> for the FDA to tell him.
WIGAND He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America.
WIGAND Instantly.
WIGAND And then he developed the safety cap...
WIGAND Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right?
WIGAND But he's also a man of science.
WIGAND He's not going to allow his company...to put on the shelf...a product that might hurt people.
WIGAND Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
LOWELL Seven dwarfs?
WIGAND The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...they got up in front of Congress that time...it was on television...
LOWELL ...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
WIGAND It was on C-SPAN.
WIGAND Yeah.
LOWELL Okay, so, here you are...you go to work for tobacco.
LOWELL You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values.
LOWELL You go to tobacco...
LOWELL Tobacco is a sales culture.
LOWELL Market and sell enormous volume.
LOWELL Go to a lot of golf tournaments.
LOWELL The hell with everything else.
LOWELL What are you doing?
LOWELL Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
WIGAND I can't talk about it.
WIGAND The work I was supposed to do...might have had some positive effect.
WIGAND I don't know...it could have been beneficial.
WIGAND Mostly, I got paid a lot.
WIGAND I took the money.
WIGAND My wife was happy.
WIGAND My kids had good medical.
WIGAND Good schools.
WIGAND Got a great house.
WIGAND I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
He looks at Lowell, as if needing validation...
LOWELL Nothing's wrong with that.
LOWELL That's it; you're making money...you're providing for your family?
LOWELL What could be wrong with that?
It's quiet.
After some moments...
WIGAND I've always thought of myself...as a man of science.
WIGAND That's what's wrong with it.
LOWELL Then...you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Jeffrey doesn't say anything.
LOWELL (CONT'D) Because, look, here's how it lays out: if you got vital, insider stuff the American people for their welfare really <u>do</u> need to know...and you feel impelled to disclose it and violate your agreement in doing so, that's one thing.
LOWELL (CONT'D) On the other hand, if you want to honor this agreement, then that's simple.
LOWELL (CONT'D) You do so.
LOWELL (CONT'D) You say nothing.
LOWELL (CONT'D) You do nothing.
LOWELL (CONT'D) There's only one guy who can figure that out for you.
LOWELL (CONT'D) And that's you.
LOWELL (CONT'D) All by yourself.
Lowell's evenhanded...is it <u>too</u> evenhanded?
As Wigand contemplates the edge he's standing on, they're quiet.
Then Wigand sees the time...
WIGAND I've got to go pick up the girls.
WIGAND They only had half a day...
Lowell nods.
Jeffrey starts the car.
The windshield wipers screech on a dry window.
Their eyes meet.
As they drive off...we HOLD on the Colgate-Palmolive Clock.
We've entered mid-scene...
A monitor on a cart plays a 1/2- inch VCR of a C-SPAN broadcast.
Seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...
in front of a bas relief of the American eagle.
Each in turn swears nicotine is not addictive or he doesn't know anything about health risks, they're not sure, maybe, maybe not, etc....
LOWELL (OVER) He referred to this...the Seven Dwarfs...
MIKE WALLACE (OVER) What "Seven Dwarfs?"
LOWELL (OVER) The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...
LOWELL (OVER) Referred to this...
LOWELL (OVER) Said they <u>should</u> be afraid of him...
LOWELL (OVER) I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.
LOWELL (OVER) Now, you tell me.
LOWELL (OVER) What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
And, now, we see Lowell, Mike Wallace and Debbie DeLuca with two staff Lawyers, MARK STERN and JOHN HARRIS, sitting around a workstation used as an improvised eating area.
Beyond them are the "60 MINUTES" offices, workstations, piles of material, television monitors hanging from the ceiling, all tuned to CBS programming...
MIKE WALLACE Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
LOWELL Hardly new news.
MIKE WALLACE No shit.
LOWELL What's this?
MARK STERN What that is is tobacco's standard defense.
MARK STERN It's the "we don't know" litany: "Addiction?
MARK STERN We <u>believe</u> not.
MARK STERN Disease?
MARK STERN We don't know.
MARK STERN We take a bunch of leaves, roll 'em together.
MARK STERN You smoke 'em.
MARK STERN After that?
MARK STERN You're on your own.
MARK STERN We don't know."
MARK STERN So...tells me nothing.
MARK STERN Besides, you'll never get what he's got.
LOWELL Why not?
JOHN HARRIS Because of this guy's confidentiality agreement, he is never gonna be able to talk to you.
LOWELL That's not good enough.
LOWELL This guy is the top scientist in the number three tobacco company in America.
LOWELL He's a corporate officer.
LOWELL You <u>never</u> get whistle-blowers from Fortune 500 companies.
LOWELL This guy is the ultimate insider.
LOWELL He's got something to say; he wants to say it; I want it on "60 Minutes."
JOHN HARRIS Doesn't matter what he <u>wants</u>.
MIKE WALLACE Am I missing something here?
JOHN HARRIS What do you mean, Mike?
MIKE WALLACE He's got a corporate secrecy agreement?
MIKE WALLACE Give me a break.
MIKE WALLACE This is a public-health issue, like an unsafe airframe on a passenger jet or...some company dumping cyanide into the East River.
MIKE WALLACE Issues like that?
MIKE WALLACE He can talk, we can air it.
MIKE WALLACE They've got no right to hide behind a corporate agreement.
MIKE WALLACE Pass the milk...
JOHN HARRIS They don't need the right.
JOHN HARRIS They've got the money.
MARK STERN The unlimited checkbook.
MARK STERN That's how Big Tobacco wins every time.
MARK STERN On everything.
MARK STERN They spend you to death.
MARK STERN $600 million a year in outside legal.
MARK STERN Chadbourne-Parke.
MARK STERN Ken Starr's firm, Kirkland and Ellis.
MARK STERN Listen.
MARK STERN GM and Ford, they get nailed after 11 or 12 pick-ups blow up.
MARK STERN Right?
MARK STERN These clowns have never...I mean ever...
JOHN HARRIS Not even once...
MARK STERN ...not even with hundreds of thousands dying each year from an illness related to their product...have <u>ever</u> lost a personal-injury lawsuit.
MARK STERN On this case, they'll issue gag orders, sue for breach, anticipatory breach, enjoin him, you, us, his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian...
MARK STERN Tie him up in litigation for ten of fifteen years.
MARK STERN I'm telling you, they bat a thousand.
MARK STERN Every time.
MARK STERN He knows that.
MARK STERN That's why he's not gonna talk to you...
Lowell's been quiet, thinking about something else...
Now...
LOWELL Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
MIKE WALLACE What do you mean?
LOWELL We got a guy...who wants to talk but he's constrained.
LOWELL What if he were "compelled"?
MIKE WALLACE Oh, torture?
MIKE WALLACE Great ratings.
MARK STERN What do you mean compelled?
LOWELL I mean compelled by a Justice Department, state courts, be a witness.
LOWELL That would cut through any confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it?
MARK STERN Yeah...
DEBBIE DELUCA What does that do?
LOWELL What do you mean, what's it do?
DEBBIE DELUCA What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
LOWELL Because he has to reveal it in a court of law.
LOWELL It's on record, it's out.
LOWELL It's no secret anymore.
LOWELL So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate?
LOWELL It's out in the world...
MARK STERN If you could engineer it into the court record, you might have something.
MARK STERN They would have a helluva time trying to restrain his speech then, wouldn't they?
Pause.
JOHN HARRIS Yeah, but what venue?
JOHN HARRIS And where does he get - does he have killer attorneys?
LOWELL I don't think he's got any attorneys.
MARK STERN He's gonna need attorneys who aren't afraid of risking years of litigation.
MARK STERN And millions of dollars of their <u>own</u> dough in legal costs...
LOWELL What do you say, Mike?
LOWELL What do you think?
MIKE WALLACE Even if he gets the defense team, will he go for it?
WATSON ...you're awfully overqualified, Dr.
WATSON Wigand.
The aftermath of a high school lunch.
Tables, covered with litter, as far as the eye can see.
And we see Jeffrey sitting with a formidable Black Woman in her mid-fifties, the High School Principal, CYNTHIA WATSON, drinking cups of coffee...
WIGAND I'm trying to...start a new career...
WIGAND I believe I could be a good teacher...
She's quiet.
She senses this applicant has a lot on his mind.
MRS. WATSON Let me give it some thought...
WIGAND ...and not a lot of companies in the health-care field hire ex-tobacco scientists.
She nods, studying him.
They get up.
The house is nearly empty.
Liane, arms folded across her chest, is quietly standing in the empty living room.
Jeffrey comes down the stairs...
WIGAND That's it...
And it's quiet.
And Liane holds herself, overcome...
LIANE That's where our babies were born...
LIANE Debbie took her first steps, right there...in the grass.
And they're quiet.
LIANE (CONT'D) I didn't plan on this...
Liane looks at him, afraid.
And as he moves to hold her.
WIGAND Hey, hey, hey, c'mon.
WIGAND C'mon.
WIGAND We can make this work for us.
WIGAND Okay?
WIGAND It's just...it's a smaller scale.
WIGAND Simpler...easier...more time.
WIGAND More time together.
WIGAND More time with the kids.
WIGAND More time for us, okay?
WIGAND It's just...
WIGAND Can you imagine me coming home from some job feeling good at the end of the day?
WIGAND This is gonna be better.
WIGAND This is gonna be better.
And instead of this downturn turning them against each other, it brings them closer together.
And as they stand in the empty house...
We see unpacked boxes in the small 1970's kitchen.
Country- western music is playing on a radio.
And we see Liane busily putting things away in a cabinet.
And, then, stops and looks out the window.
She tightens a knob on a cabinet.
There's a moment of domestic peace for her as she sees...
Jeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small tomato trellises.
We see the house, now.
It's a small, one story.
Deborah sees her mom and waves.
It's an image from the 1950's post-war boom.
Liane waves back from behind the pane of glass...
Jeffrey's asleep on his side next to Liane, her back to him.
His arm is draped over her, protectively.
There's a sound.
He turns.
And he sees Barbara in her nightgown, standing in the doorway...
WIGAND Hey, baby.
WIGAND What's wrong?
BARBARA What's that outside, Daddy?
WIGAND Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
BARBARA I heard them.
WIGAND Where?
BARBARA In the backyard.
Fast, soundlessly, he's out of bed into old moccasins and trousers...
Jeffrey goes into a corner of the basement, around the corner from the furnace, where his "office" is now.
Unpacked boxes are on the floor.
He fumbles with the combination lock on a small gun safe, lifts the lid, taking out a hand gun.
Barbara followed him.
WIGAND Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?
WIGAND Why don't you just sit up at the desk.
WIGAND Get out some paper and draw me a picture, okay?
WIGAND What are you gonna draw me, baby?
WIGAND An animal, something like that?
WIGAND You stay down here until Daddy gets back...alright, Barbara?
WIGAND You stay down here.
He keeps it hidden from Barbara.
He goes up the stairs.
It's still.
He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark shrubs and small tree in the corner.
Meanwhile, Barbara in the basement, starts as the water heater comes on, scaring her.
She goes up the stairs to follow after her father...
Meanwhile, Jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back corners.
Sudden rustling.
He spins, gun ready.
And the yellow eyes of a RACCOON stare at him.
WIGAND You almost got your damn head blown off...
The raccoon defiantly bares its teeth.
Jeffrey starts to go...but he sees something and stops...
Meanwhile, Barbara has come to the sliding glass door...
Jeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed, stepped on...and in the vegetable garden's earth, are distinct, fresh, deep FOOTPRINTS...
BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER) Daddy...
Wigand steps between her and the garden, hiding it...
EXTREMELY CLOSE ON JEFFREY, as he covers, trying to keep from his daughter the invasion, trying to control his emotions...
WIGAND It's just a raccoon, baby...nothing.
He crosses to her, putting his arm, around her, walking her back inside...
WIGAND (CONT'D) They're nocturnal.
WIGAND (CONT'D) You know what that means?
WIGAND (CONT'D) That means that they only come out at nighttime.
He locks the sliding glass door, takes a last look outside.
The Phone suddenly RINGS.
Lowell asleep, alone...
He gets it...
LOWELL Yeah...
It's dark, save a light from the living room.
Liane, in bed, seemingly sleeping.
And we see Jeffrey, just outside their door in the foyer, sitting on the floor against a curved wall, a drink at his side on the telephone...
A man with no one to talk to...
WIGAND Lowell...
WIGAND Jeffrey Wigand...
Lowell sits up...
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) Is it too late?
LOWELL No.
LOWELL No, it's okay...
LOWELL How's - how's the new place?
WIGAND The new place?
WIGAND New.
LOWELL You okay?
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) Sure.
Lowell knows he isn't...
LOWELL You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.
LOWELL How are your kids handling the new house?
WIGAND Good.
WIGAND You have kids?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) We have a couple.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) One's hers, one's mine.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Everybody uses a different name.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Modern marriage.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) How's Liane?
WIGAND She's okay.
He looks at Liane for beat.
We SEE his POV in medium shot.
Then he moves and sits on the floor in the living room.
WIGAND (CONT'D) Hold on a minute, Lowell...
WIGAND (CONT'D) ...somebody...may be following me.
WIGAND (CONT'D) I don't know.
WIGAND (CONT'D) They came on the property...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) What do you mean followed you?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Did you call the police?
WIGAND I don't want to be paranoid...
WIGAND I mean, maybe it's a game.
WIGAND Some kind of mind game.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Well, what do you <u>really</u> think, though?
WIGAND I don't know what the <u>fuck</u> I <u>really</u> think!
WIGAND Are they doing it?
WIGAND Is some crank doing it?
WIGAND Are they doing it to make me <u>feel</u> paranoid?
WIGAND Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think?
WIGAND I don't know!
WIGAND I don't fucking know.
And it's quiet again.
Lowell sitting in bed on the phone, alarmed, sharing Wigand's fears.
LOWELL Jeffrey, describe for me in detail what happened.
And Jeffrey's emotions are back in check as...
WIGAND Well, no, look...I mean, there was a footprint.
WIGAND Forget it.
WIGAND It's probably not important at all.
WIGAND You know, I got a job now.
WIGAND I'm teaching high school.
WIGAND Japanese and Chemistry.
WIGAND So, what were you calling about?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) You called me.
He takes another drink...
WIGAND No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow.
WIGAND So, what about?
LOWELL Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did...I wanted to talk to you.
LOWELL I wanted to hook up and talk to you.
LOWELL About what we were talking about in your car.
WIGAND ...okay.
LOWELL Makes you feel good?
LOWELL Putting what you know to use?
Jeffrey's impressed by Lowell's perceptivity...
WIGAND How'd you know that, Lowell?
LOWELL It's obvious, isn't it?
He looks at Liane in the next room, asleep.
LOWELL (CONT'D) Hello.
LOWELL (CONT'D) You there
WIGAND Yeah...
WIGAND Look, thanks for talking.
WIGAND I'm sorry I woke you up.
LOWELL It's okay.
Jeffrey hesitates, holding the phone, then he hangs up...but the phone RINGS right away.
WIGAND Lowell...?
But there's thick silence.
WIGAND (CONT'D) Who is this?
WIGAND (CONT'D) Do not call here!
WIGAND (CONT'D) Do not...
They hang up.
And he realizes he's talking to a DIAL TONE.
He hangs up.
And as he sits in the patch of light from a street lamp, the gun in his hand on his lap, to be up all night guarding his family...
And past Liane's sleeping form down the hall into the living room is her husband, his back to her, sitting in the trapezoid of light.
And as we DOLLY along her side, we come upon her face and discover she's been up all along and her eyes are pressed shut, her hands over her ears...her reaction to his raging on the phone.
She's far from "OKAY."
And we see Lowell and Wigand sitting in their stocking feet at a traditional Japanese table in a private screened room...
A traditionally-dressed Japanese Waitress waiting to take their order...
Wigand conversing with her in Japanese...
The Waitress formally nods, and leaves...
LOWELL What did you get us?
WIGAND Tempura...
And Wigand drinks some more saki.
WIGAND (cont'd) The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor...Marcus?
LOWELL Marcuse.
LOWELL Yeah.
LOWELL He was my mentor.
LOWELL He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s...and on me, personally.
WIGAND Next to your father?
LOWELL My father?
LOWELL What the hell's that got to do with my father?
WIGAND Is that why you became a journalist?
WIGAND Then you get to ask all the questions?
LOWELL You charge by the hour?
WIGAND My father was a mechanical engineer...most ingenious man I ever knew.
LOWELL Well, my father left us when I was five- years old.
LOWELL He was <u>not</u> the most ingenious man I ever knew...
LOWELL Let's get back to Brown & Williamson.
LOWELL If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
WIGAND Why?
LOWELL They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you.
LOWELL I got to know what they're gonna throw.
LOWELL You understand?
WIGAND I drink.
WIGAND A couple of occasions more than I should have.
WIGAND I was <u>cited</u> for shoplifting once.
WIGAND But it was a mistake...
WIGAND I pushed Liane one time.
WIGAND We were both stressed out because of the pressure.
WIGAND She went to her mother's.
WIGAND I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself.
WIGAND And I don't like to be pushed around!
LOWELL <u>I'm</u> not pushing you around!
LOWELL I'm asking you questions.
WIGAND I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I?
WIGAND I could be anything.
WIGAND Right?
WIGAND Anything worth putting on between commercials...
LOWELL ...to a network, probably, we're <u>all</u> commodities.
LOWELL To me?
LOWELL You are <u>not</u> a commodity.
LOWELL What you are is important.
And he's begun to consciously or unconsciously "sell"...
LOWELL (cont'd) You go public and thirty-million people hear what you got to say, nothing, I mean nothing, will ever be the same again.
Wigand doesn't react.
LOWELL (cont'd) You believe that?
WIGAND No.
LOWELL You should.
LOWELL Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend.
LOWELL And that's the power you have.
WIGAND You believe <u>that</u>?
LOWELL I believe that?
LOWELL Yes, I believe that.
WIGAND You believe that because you get information out to people...something happens?
LOWELL Yes.
WIGAND Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job?
WIGAND Having status?
WIGAND And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism?
WIGAND Something to do on a Sunday night.
WIGAND And maybe it won't change a fucking thing.
WIGAND And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry.
WIGAND Used up!
WIGAND Broke, alone!
LOWELL Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?!
LOWELL I never abandoned a source!
WIGAND I don't think you really understand --
LOWELL No, don't evade a choice <u>you</u> gotta make be questioning <u>my</u> reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
WIGAND I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend!
WIGAND And what are you puttin' up?
WIGAND You're puttin' up words!
LOWELL Words!
LOWELL While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out <u>in the world</u>, giving my word and backing it up with action.
Lowell is getting very close, in spite of the value of Wigand, to telling Jeff to take his story and stick it up his ass.
LOWELL (cont'd) Now, are you going to go do this thing, or not?
Wigand abruptly rises...
WIGAND I said I'd call the kids before they went to bed.
WIGAND Onisa...
And turning, he crosses the restaurant.
And that's where it hangs.
And we see we're watching footage in an on-line editing bay from what we will learn is Lowell's "N.O.P.D.
Blue" on police corruption in New Orleans.
Lowell, TONY BALDO (his editor), Debbie and an intense YOUNG MAN wearing glasses, an Intern, looking at the cut.
<u>All the</u> <u>police are on horseback</u>, <u>lots of cops on horses</u>.
Lowell is waiting for a call to go through...
LOWELL The stringer was supposed to be shooting B-roll on street cops in New Orleans.
LOWELL What's with all the horses?
TONY BALDO Camera guy's got a thing about mounted police.
LOWELL Don't any of these guys ride in cars or walk?
TONY BALDO How long did he stay on this?
LOWELL What was he seeing?
DEBBIE DELUCA Yes, hello...
DEBBIE DELUCA I'm trying to reach Mr.
DEBBIE DELUCA Richard Scruggs...
And we see the PILOT, a fit-looking, unassuming man, wearing aviator glasses, in his late forties.
A heavyset Man in his forties, riding up in the co-pilot's seat we'll come to know as RON MOTLEY.
The Pilot's on a headset...
He has a distinctive Southern accent...
THE PILOT This is Richard Scruggs...
DEBBIE DELUCA Could you hold on one second, please?
DEBBIE DELUCA Lowell, I got him on the phone.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Hello, I'm Lowell Bergman.
RICHARD SCRUGGS Hold on...
RICHARD SCRUGGS Mobile approach...this is Lear November 643.
RICHARD SCRUGGS Over.
CONTROL OPERATOR'S VOICE (OVER) Go ahead 643.
RICHARD SCRUGGS Request a flight level 220, on a heading of 284 degrees.
RICHARD SCRUGGS Over.
RICHARD SCRUGGS Mr. Bergman?
LOWELL Yes, I'm right here.
LOWELL Could you call me back on a hard line?
RICHARD SCRUGGS Alright.
LOWELL Area code 212-555-0199.
RICHARD SCRUGGS I'll call you then.
Through the window, we see Scruggs' plane being refueled while Scruggs and Motley in a run-down lounge are talking on a SPEAKER PHONE with Lowell.
They've taken over the Secretary's office for privacy.
LOWELL What do we do with that?
The phone rings.
DEBBIE DELUCA I don't know.
RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER) Richard Scruggs...
LOWELL ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
RICHARD SCRUGGS That's right...
LOWELL Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
RICHARD SCRUGGS What's your interest in this, Mr.
RICHARD SCRUGGS Bergman?
LOWELL Well, he may tape an interview with us.
LOWELL And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
MOTLEY It could work.
MOTLEY If it's public record, it's public record.
LOWELL Yeah, and he's going to need legal representation.
MOTLEY He sure as hell will.
RICHARD SCRUGGS Has he decided to go public?
RICHARD SCRUGGS Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know...
RICHARD SCRUGGS Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him.
RICHARD SCRUGGS So, is your man truly committed?
LOWELL Well, actually, no.
LOWELL Well, he's on the fence.
LOWELL That's the point.
Scruggs and Motley exchange a look...
Motley shrugs...
RICHARD SCRUGGS Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
LOWELL Well, would you want him to call you?
LOWELL Or, you want to call him?
LOWELL How do you want to do it?
RICHARD SCRUGGS It would be better if he called us.
LOWELL Yeah.
RICHARD SCRUGGS Alright?
LOWELL Okay.
LOWELL Thank you.
At this moment, these two attorneys are unsold on the prospect of Jeffrey Wigand.
Scruggs disconnects.
LOWELL (cont'd) Shit...
LOWELL Oh, we need cops on the street.
LOWELL We don't need them on horses.
DEBBIE DELUCA I don't know what he was thinking.
LOWELL Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
DEBBIE DELUCA Alright, alright.
LOWELL Get me to New Orleans this afternoon.
LOWELL I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
TIGHTEN on mounted New Orleans police at crime scene, herding crowd.
Liane cooking dinner, making pasta.
Ingredients, diced tomato, basil, are neatly ordered.
She's waiting for water to boil.
The kids are doing homework on the round table in the kitchenette.
It's an idle moment.
She's dazed-out watching them.
DEBORAH What are you cooking?
LIANE I'm cooking pasta primavera.
DEBORAH Oh, I love that stuff.
And now she hears from the basement the BELL RING on Jeffrey's computer.
It's a tiny bell, incessant...
She crosses to the basement stairs.
LIANE I'm going to have to go downstairs.
Liane down the stairs, approaching Jeffrey's computer.
And she SEES an incoming E-mail icon - a large letter with wings - flying repetitively across the screen.
The bell RINGING is louder.
She calls-up the E-mail...
On the screen in large RED letters:
And now Liane is shouting and running up the stairs and...
LIANE Debbie, Barbara...
LIANE Debbie!
Jeffrey, having arrived home from work, pulls the mail out of the mailbox, now stands, frozen, staring at something...
And he sees, standing upright in the back of the mail box, like a monument of threat, a single hollow point .38 CALIBER BULLET.
He freezes...
And simultaneously...
Liane and the Girls are running toward him...like in a bad fucking dream.
He's looking at them.
Liane is saying something about E-mail, but his slow-motion attention is still arrested by the statuesque bullet.
As they close on him...
And we see Lowell lit by FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS.
We're at a crime scene.
Uniformed cops on horseback.
Just arrived, the Cameraman's unloading his gear, preparing to shoot B-roll.
LOWELL What happened?
COP Dispatch received a call of shots fired in the area.
COP Uniforms arrived on the scene and found this white male subject shot to death.
LOWELL Was it gang related?
COP There's no indication as far as a tag or an advertisement...
Police moving around as Lowell's cell phone RINGS...
LOWELL Excuse me.
LOWELL Yeah...
WIGAND They're terrorizing us.
WIGAND Death threats?!
WIGAND To my <u>family</u>?
WIGAND My kids?!
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) What are you talking about?
WIGAND Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
LOWELL Jeff, call the FBI right away...
WIGAND They do this with impunity!
LOWELL Jeff...
WIGAND They get to go home at night.
WIGAND What does it cost these people to do this to us?
WIGAND Nothing?!
WIGAND My girls are crying, so fuck them!
WIGAND I want to tape!
WIGAND I'm done thinking about it.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) I heard you.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) But I got to arrange a legal defense first.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
WIGAND Then hold it off the air until you got that.
WIGAND But I want to go to New York.
WIGAND And I want to go on the record.
WIGAND Right now!
LOWELL Good.
LOWELL But Jeff...
WIGAND I'll call them, Lowell.
And two older, local FBI AGENTS #1 and #2 are sitting with Jeffrey in his living room...
FBI AGENT #2 Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
WIGAND Yes, I'm afraid I did.
FBI AGENT #1 We won't be able to lift usable prints.
FBI AGENT #2 Do you own a gun, Mr. Wigand?
WIGAND A gun?
WIGAND Yes.
FBI AGENT #2 What caliber is your gun?
WIGAND What caliber is my gun?
FBI AGENT #2 Yes, sir.
FBI AGENT #2 What caliber is your gun?
WIGAND What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
Now one of the kids is crying, Liane trying to calm her, takes her out of the room.
WIGAND (CONT'D) You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
FBI AGENT #2 If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
And he gets up...
They follow him into the bedroom.
He unlocks the side drawer on his night stand, taking out a gun, giving it to one of the Agents.
FBI AGENT #1 Why do you keep this gun?
WIGAND I don't think it's unconstitutional <u>yet</u> to own a gun.
WIGAND I'm a target shooter.
FBI AGENT #2 That bullet was for a .38 caliber.
FBI AGENT #2 Do you own a .38?
WIGAND Yes, I do.
WIGAND A .38 Target Master.
WIGAND In my gun safe downstairs.
WIGAND A .45 Gold Cup.
WIGAND A .22 target pistol.
WIGAND So what?
FBI AGENT #2 Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
WIGAND Yes.
WIGAND Yes, I do.
WIGAND Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
And we hear Liane's voice from downstairs...
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER) I didn't tell you that so you could just pick it up and take it away.
LIANE'S VOICE (OVER) Jeffrey!
And we see Liane following FBI Agent #3, coming up the stairs from the basement, and the Agent is carrying Jeffrey's computer...
WIGAND What's going on?
LIANE I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
Agent #3 starts out of the house with the computer followed by #2.
Jeffrey runs out after them.
WIGAND You can't take that...
WIGAND It's personal property...!
FBI AGENT #2 (OR #3) We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand.
FBI AGENT #2 (OR #3) There's been a death threat.
WIGAND ...my files!
WIGAND Personal correspondence...
Agent #3 ignores him, putting the computer in the trunk of their car.
And FBI Agent #1, the .38 bullet in a baggie, comes out of the house.
WIGAND (CONT'D) ...letters to my brother...my will.
His shoes slip on the grass and he falls.
And the FBI are getting into their car.
And NEIGHBORS have come out, watching them.
Liane and the girls, standing halfway down the front lawn, the neighbors looking at them.
She and Jeffrey look at each other.
Will she go to him or not?
She goes to him as he rises...
WIGAND (cont'd) That computer has everything...
FBI AGENT #2 You alright, Mr. Wigand?
FBI AGENT #1 We need to take a look at your gun safe, Mr. Wigand.
LOWELL I'm telling you, your agents in that office are acting improperly!
LOWELL Now, who are they trying to protect?
And we see a Man in his early forties, a neatly-dressed man who prides himself on his appearance, at his desk in the Bureau (FBI).
BILL ROBERTSON.
He's completely distracted, focused on agent travel orders...
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) Let me tell you something, Lowell.
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) Look, look, look.
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville.
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX!
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) Alright?
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
LOWELL You better take a good look!
LOWELL Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious!
LOWELL Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire?
LOWELL Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals <u>already</u> in those jobs?
LOWELL Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
BILL ROBERTSON I'll give it a look.
LOWELL You're getting my drift?
BILL ROBERTSON I'll give it a look.
He hangs up.
And we slide by some elegant diners to fall onto Lowell and Mike Wallace with Jeffrey and Liane in the Hotel's dining room, having ordered dinner.
LOWELL So, is everything okay?
MIKE WALLACE How are the rooms?
MIKE WALLACE Comfortable?
LIANE Yes, very.
LIANE You know, I enjoy your work so much...when you're talking to somebody, I always feel like I'm right there.
And she laughs...
MIKE WALLACE Thank you got saying that...
LOWELL Do you think we could talk about the taping?
LOWELL Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
MIKE WALLACE Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired.
MIKE WALLACE And others will deal...
LIANE ...taping?
LIANE What are you taping?
WIGAND I'm doing an interview.
LIANE An interview!
LIANE Do you know what they will do to us...!
LIANE I thought...
LIANE Sorry.
But she suddenly gets up and leaves, hurrying out of the dining room.
And Jeffrey oddly doesn't move.
LOWELL Liane, this is a preliminary...
LOWELL You didn't tell her we were taping?
LOWELL What did she think she was coming to New York for?
WIGAND ...to talk about it.
WIGAND To think about it.
WIGAND I had a plan to ease her into it.
WIGAND But, I really - I didn't know how to do that...
Jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby Bar.
LOWELL Oh, man.
MIKE WALLACE Who <u>are</u> these people?
LOWELL Ordinary people!
LOWELL Under <u>extraordinary</u> pressure, Mike.
LOWELL What the hell do you expect?
LOWELL Grace and consistency?
And Lowell leaves the table.
And as Mike Wallace sits at the table, looking around, wondering what the fuck he's doing there.
Liane folds her arms protectively across her chest...
And we see a small TAPING STUDIO separated by flats and black curtains from other CBS News sets.
Cameras are set up.
And we enter mid-scene on Jeffrey in a more formal demeanor, sitting in a chair, Mike Wallace sitting across from him, under the lights, taping an interview.
Lowell, off camera.
MIKE WALLACE You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he <u>believed</u> nicotine was <u>not</u> addictive...?
WIGAND ...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
Lowell's reaction.
Jeffrey's statements are stunning and powerful revelations...and dangerous ones to make.
MIKE WALLACE All of us did.
MIKE WALLACE There was this whole <u>line</u> of people...whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
WIGAND Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly <u>misstated</u>...what is common language within the company...we are in the nicotine delivery business.
MIKE WALLACE And that's what cigarettes are for...?
WIGAND A delivery device for nicotine.
MIKE WALLACE A delivery device for nicotine.
MIKE WALLACE Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
WIGAND You're gonna get your fix...
MIKE WALLACE You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
WIGAND The process is known as "impact boosting..."
WIGAND While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it.
WIGAND There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry."
WIGAND It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
WIGAND The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin."
WIGAND When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful.
WIGAND I wanted it out immediately.
WIGAND I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business.
WIGAND I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
MIKE WALLACE And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
WIGAND I sent the document forward to Sandefur.
WIGAND I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
MIKE WALLACE In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations <u>consciously</u>...
WIGAND Most certainly.
MIKE WALLACE And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired.
MIKE WALLACE And the reason he gave you?
WIGAND Poor communication skills.
MIKE WALLACE And, do you wish you hadn't come forward?
MIKE WALLACE You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
WIGAND Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it.
WIGAND There are times I feel compelled to do it.
WIGAND If you asked me would I do it again?
WIGAND Do I think it's worth it?
WIGAND Yeah, I think it's worth it.
Not too many kids paying attention.
Meanwhile, Jeffrey has written his name on the blackboard.
WIGAND Hi.
KIDS Hi.
WIGAND My name is Jeff Wigand.
WIGAND You can call me Mr. Wigand; you can call me Dr. Wigand--I have a Ph.D.
WIGAND in biochemistry and endocrinology; you can call me Jeff...
WIGAND Anything else you want to call me...you'll have to do so in private...
WIGAND Okay...
WIGAND I find chemistry to be magical.
WIGAND I find it an adventure.
WIGAND An exploration into the building blocks of our physical universe...
WIGAND So, how many of you have taken chemistry before?
Nobody raises their hands.
WIGAND (CONT'D) Okay...I've never taught it before, so we're gonna be fine.
A couple of laughs...
And we feel Jeffrey, for the first time is in a milieu that suits him.
WIGAND (cont'd) Our first experiment is...
WIGAND (cont'd) ...going to be measuring the molecular weight of butane...
Scruggs' office is decorated with watercolors of Phantom jets and A-6s as Scruggs takes off his glasses...
CHARLENE He's on line three.
Jeffrey Wigand is on a pay phone in the corridor crowded with students...
RICHARD SCRUGGS Hello.
WIGAND Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand.
WIGAND Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
RICHARD SCRUGGS My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.
RICHARD SCRUGGS If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
WIGAND When should we do this?
Jeffrey drives up the block and onto his driveway.
Seeing a MAN in a suit, an ear piece in his ear, disappearing around the corner of his house, Jeffrey leaps out of the car.
But the front door's open.
So instead of chasing after, he runs inside...
And he sees another Man is in the living room...
WIGAND Who the hell are you?!
WIGAND What are you doing in my house?!
And he sees Lowell enter from the dining room...
LOWELL It's okay, Jeff.
SECURITY GUARD Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to...
LOWELL It's okay.
LOWELL You got your own security now...
Wigand catches his breath.
WIGAND Lowell, I can't afford --
LOWELL ...they "volunteered."
LOWELL A friend owns a large security company.
TALIFARO How are you doing, Mr. Wigand?
TALIFARO I'm Jon Talifaro.
TALIFARO There'll be three of us on detail.
LIANE I'm going to the store.
LIANE Please explain our new "houseguests" to your children.
And Wigand looks at Lowell...
Barbara comes into the living room and holds onto her father's leg.
WIGAND I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
LOWELL I heard.
WIGAND I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation.
WIGAND So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
LOWELL I know.
LOWELL I'm going to go there tonight...
WIGAND Did you have a good day?
DEBORAH Yes, I did.
DEBORAH I had a great day.
WIGAND Coffee, Lowell?
LOWELL Yeah.
LOWELL Want to play that game we were playing before?
LOWELL You know, I think you got it up to five.
LOWELL I was ahead of you.
She goes over and holds his hand.
And as he holds her hand, seeing what his life has become, he looks up and his glance connects with Lowell...
We see out the window a Security Guard, incongruous, walking by.
And we see Liane, finished with the dinner dishes, silently wiping off the sink.
There's a pall you could cut with a knife.
A moment, and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen door from the garden...
He stops to wash his hands in the sink.
LIANE Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
WIGAND Where should I wash them?
LIANE Use the bathroom.
WIGAND What's the difference...
LIANE That's for food.
But he ignores her, washing his hands...
And she turns the water off.
He turns it back on.
He thinks, then turns it off.
Then <u>she</u> turns it <u>on</u>.
LIANE (cont'd) Leave it on!
LIANE (cont'd) Just leave it on, okay?!
And she turns and leaves the room, coldly, all her anger repressed.
For Jeffrey, everything else and now this?
The running faucet.
The house on the quiet suburban street.
A Security Guard, incongruous, a noticeable bulge where his shoulder holster is, sitting watch under the porch light on the small front porch in a metal porch chair.
And we see Jeffrey, unable to sleep, sitting at his desk, alone in the basement, listening to classical music.
He instinctively turns.
And he sees Liane, in her bathrobe, has come down to sit on the basement stairs.
He looks over at her.
And he thinks she's come down to make up.
And all she really wants him to do is say, "I need you..."
But he can't...
And like ships that pass in the night, nothing's said.
It's quiet.
She puts her hands protectively in her robe pockets.
And she starts to cry...
LIANE I don't think I can do this...
LIANE I want to stand by my husband...
LIANE I really do, Jeffrey.
LIANE But I don't think I can do this anymore.
LIANE I am so sorry...
WIGAND Can we talk about this when I get back?
LIANE Yes...Jeffrey.
She goes back up the stairs.
And as Jeffrey sits in the basement, and the music plays.
We see Jeffrey and his Security Man.
He passes a small Filipino Woman in a nurse's uniform and a Man in clerical garb, who hands him a small American Flag, asking for donations.
And, now, he passes through the metal detector.
He nods thanks and walks towards us, relaxing, looking behind every so often to see if anybody is following him.
As he passes Gate 3, he HEARS over his shoulder...
THE MAN Jeff...?
Jeffrey turns and the Man throws a sheaf of SUBPOENAS at his chest...
THE MAN (CONT'D) You've been served.
And he turns and walks off.
And as Jeffrey looks down at the subpoenas...
Jeffrey is sitting with Scruggs and Motley in Scruggs' kitchen around a semi-circular counter.
Coffee and sweet rolls.
It's casual.
No one's dressed for court.
Scruggs has been looking through the sheaf of subpoenas.
About Motley, we sense power held in reserve.
RICHARD SCRUGGS Now, what this one is, is a temporary restraining order, a gag order, issued by a Kentucky court.
Meanwhile, a movie-star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a tie, a coffee cup in his hand, enters and sits casually on the arm of a chair.
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
MICHAEL MOORE Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
RICHARD SCRUGGS Mike's our Attorney General down here.
RICHARD SCRUGGS I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
MICHAEL MOORE Right.
RICHARD SCRUGGS Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...
RICHARD SCRUGGS However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
MICHAEL MOORE Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
WIGAND I'm not free to testify...here...?
MOTLEY That's right.
MOTLEY If you violate the Kentucky order, when you step foot back in Kentucky, they can find you in contempt and they can incarcerate you.
MOTLEY And you ought to know that.
And Jeffrey fairly turns white, it's never occurred to him he might go to jail...
WIGAND Jail?
RICHARD SCRUGGS Possibly, yes.
RICHARD SCRUGGS That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today.
RICHARD SCRUGGS That's right...
WIGAND How does one..."
WIGAND go...to...jail?" What does my family do?
WIGAND Go on welfare?
WIGAND If my wife has to work?
WIGAND Who's going to look after the kids?
WIGAND Put food on the table?
WIGAND My children need me.
WIGAND If I'm not teaching...there's no medical...no medical...even on co-pay, that's like...
WIGAND Tuition...
MICHAEL MOORE Dr. Wigand, listen, you may not be able to do this thing.
MICHAEL MOORE As I understand from Dick, you're our key witness.
MICHAEL MOORE And, I hope you don't withdraw.
MICHAEL MOORE I guess we'd all understand if you did...
MICHAEL MOORE Guys, I've got to go.
MICHAEL MOORE I'm gonna be late for court.
MICHAEL MOORE I'll see y'all a little later.
MICHAEL MOORE Dr. Wigand, good luck.
He leaves.
And Jeffrey's quiet, frightened.
Having shaken the departing Moore's hand, he now turns away from Scruggs and Motley, thinking about consequences.
RICHARD SCRUGGS I know what you're facing, Jeff.
RICHARD SCRUGGS And, I think I know how you're feeling...
Jeffrey's skeptical <u>anybody</u> could know "how it is"...
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) In the Navy I flew A-6's off carriers...
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) In combat, events have a duration of seconds, sometimes minutes...
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) But what you're going through goes on day in and day out.
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) Whether you're ready for it or not, week in, week out...
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) Month after month after month.
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) Whether you're up or whether you're down.
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) You're assaulted psychologically.
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) You're assaulted financially, which is its own special kind of violence.
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) Because it's directed at your kids...what school can you afford...
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) How will that affect their lives.
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) You're asking yourself: Will that limit what they may become?
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) You feel your whole family's future's compromised...held hostage...
RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D) I <u>do</u> know how it is.
A white, traditional, Southern house, with a veranda and gables...a large front lawn with weeping willows.
And we see Lowell, hands in his pockets, not an insider or an outsider, waiting alone on the expansive lawn.
The front door opens.
A Mississippi State Trooper, putting on his round brimmed hat comes out and crosses the driveway.
Then Jeffrey coming out with Motley.
Motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment and then heads towards his car.
Meanwhile, Jeffrey comes down over to Lowell on the lawn.
And Jeffrey looks off, across the street from the house, at the Gulf.
And we see the street is blockaded by Mississippi State Police cars.
An armed camp.
Other men in suits, Lawyers and state officials, wait.
Ron Motley gets in his car and drives away.
LOWELL <u>You</u> attract a crowd.
WIGAND Yeah, great.
LOWELL I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
WIGAND I don't know what to do.
And they're quiet, a breeze of the Gulf ruffling their coats...
He looks out at the water, a cargo container ship passing by.
He watches its slow progress...
And Jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking...
And Richard Scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside Lowell...
DAY
Motley's car parks, and he and an Assistant are approached by a flurry of media from the parking lot behind us, crossing Canty Street to intercept him.
And we SEE the lot is jammed with Mercedes-Benzes, Town Cars and limousines belonging to the 150-200 Big Tobacco, Wall Street lawyers.
Some hang out by their cars, killing time.
It's a tailgate party.
Beyond them are trucks and vans with satellite dishes supporting the media circus.
They're all here for Jeff's deposition.
The scale of it dwarfs the plebeian storefront with its sign "Temporary Jackson County Courthouse"...into which Motley enters...
Jeffrey contemplating.
One TOBACCO LAWYER, an Edward Bennett-type while waiting is on his cell phone...
TOBACCO LAWYER Hold on a second...
TOBACCO LAWYER (seeing Motley enter; to Jr.
TOBACCO LAWYER Lawyer) Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he expects his witness to appear or not...?
JR.
LAWYER crosses to Motley.
Jeffrey alone on the jetty, looking out to sea.
Trying to decide, trying to untangle identity and consequence.
A moment.
He turns, crossing to Lowell and Scruggs.
Then.
it's the three men, standing on the lawn.
Time seems to slow...all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally and historically...
WIGAND I can't seem to find...the criteria to decide.
WIGAND It's too big a decision to make without being resolved...in my own mind.
They're quiet.
Jeffrey, getting nowhere.
Lowell offers...
LOWELL Maybe things have changed...
Long pause on Jeffrey as he contemplates his future.
And something just got resolved.
He asks Lowell, rhetorically...
WIGAND What's changed?
LOWELL You mean...since this morning?
WIGAND No.
WIGAND I mean since whenever...
Nothing's changed.
Wigand looks at them.
He found his own answer.
WIGAND (CONT'D) Fuck it.
WIGAND (CONT'D) Let's go to court.
And Dick Scruggs and Lowell look at this normal, somewhat flawed, very courageous man...
RICHARD SCRUGGS Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.
And there's a sudden flurry of activity.
Jeffrey and Scruggs walk to a Mississippi State Police car.
Lowell gets into his car and drives away, separately.
Police, State Officials, run to their cars.
Cars starting, lights flashing, Wigand's car pulls into position.
INT. SCRUGGS' CAR - JEFFREY - DAY in the back seat with Scruggs.
The driver's a State Policeman.
Jeffrey watches the small town of empty lots, old buildings, a 1930's Deco school pass by.
It's all heightened, especially vivid to his eyes somehow.
And he exhales heavily to calm himself, to focus...
Some of the Tobacco Lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging across Canty Street by their cars.
And now they see the police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards the courthouse.
The caravan stops.
First, Scruggs gets out.
A moment, then Jeffrey appears.
And the Reporters pounce on Jeffrey, cameras flashing...Mississippi Police leading him through the crowd...
Moore appears at courtroom door (already there).
And as he's whisked away into the courtroom.
The tobacco lawyers become dead quiet.
Cell phones are hung up.
Newspapers are put away.
Jackets are donned.
This is now very serious business.
Motley meets Jeffrey, all eyes on him.
MOTLEY Okay, Jeff, I'm going to sit you down at that table over there.
MOTLEY I'm going to start as fast as possible.
MOTLEY I don't want to give them a chance to get another restraining order, okay?
MOTLEY Let's go.
MICHAEL MOORE Good luck, Doc.
Motley calmly motions Wigand to take a chair.
He settles in.
STENOGRAPHER Please stand.
STENOGRAPHER Raise your right hand...
STENOGRAPHER Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
WIGAND I do.
STENOGRAPHER You may be seated.
MOTLEY You understand, Dr. Wigand, you are under oath.
MOTLEY This is a sworn deposition.
MOTLEY There's no judge.
MOTLEY It's not a trial.
MOTLEY Will you state your name for the record.
WIGAND Jeffrey S. Wigand.
He spells it for them...
Lowell, waiting with the other journalists...
PHOTOGRAPHER Got any idea what's going on in there?
LOWELL No, I don't have a clue.
Motley still conducting the inquiry...
And the tobacco lawyers, like a pack of dogs, waiting to pounce...
WIGAND That is correct.
MOTLEY In other words, it acts as a drug?
TOBACCO LAWYER Object to the form of the question!
MOTLEY It acts as a drug on the body?
TOBACCO LAWYER Object to the form!
MOTLEY It acts as a...
TOBACCO LAWYER Object!
MOTLEY There an echo in here?
MOTLEY Your objection's been recorded.
MOTLEY She typed it into her little machine over there.
MOTLEY It's on the record.
MOTLEY So now I'll proceed with my deposition of <u>my</u> witness.
MOTLEY Does it act as a drug?
TOBACCO LAWYER Dr. Wigand.
TOBACCO LAWYER I am instructing <u>you</u>...
TOBACCO LAWYER ...<u>not</u> to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.
TOBACCO LAWYER And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered <u>against</u> you to by the court in the State of Kentucky!
TOBACCO LAWYER That means you don't talk!
TOBACCO LAWYER Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
MOTLEY Oh, you got rights <u>and</u> lefts!
MOTLEY Ups and downs and middles!
MOTLEY So what?!
MOTLEY You don't get to instruct <u>anything</u> around here!
MOTLEY This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor <u>Kentucky</u>.
MOTLEY This is the sovereign State of <u>Mississippi</u>'s proceeding.
MOTLEY Wipe that smirk off your face!
MOTLEY Dr. Wigand's deposition <u>will</u> be part of this record.
MOTLEY And I'm going to take my witness' testimony!
MOTLEY Whether the hell you like it or not!
MOTLEY Answer the question, Dr...
WIGAND Yes.
WIGAND It produces a physiological response, which meets the definition of a drug!
WIGAND Nicotine is associated with impact, with satisfaction.
WIGAND It has a pharmacological effect that crosses the blood-brain barrier intact...
MOTLEY Thank you, Doctor.
MOTLEY Thank you.
Lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain.
There's a slight sound.
He turns.
And Jeffrey's come outside.
He stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain and windswept trees.
They're quiet.
They share a look.
They nod to each other.
The smallest nod of accomplishment.
And they're there on the porch, alone, outside the house in Pascagoula, Mississippi.
We see Lowell, unusually buoyant in the same clothes as yesterday.
He's working with Tony Baldo on a cut of the show, the net result of his architecture of events, his combination of persuasion and integrity...
We see on the Avid monitor a single of Jeffrey...
WIGAND "Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
LOWELL Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive."
LOWELL Run that on-camera.
LOWELL Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..."
LOWELL Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath.
LOWELL Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
Widen to include Debbie DeLuca, the Intern, two other Editors, Felling.
They have gathered behind Lowell in the doorway.
This is a <u>hot</u> show and it's generated excitement among Lowell's co-workers.
And while Baldo cuts, we see...
...the group has spilled out the doorway, watching Lowell's story come together.
Beyond them, approaching, is Mike Wallace, coming to work...
BILL FELLING ...helluva show, Mike.
BILL FELLING Explosive material.
People separate as Mike pushes in.
Lowell sees Mike.
While Tony Baldo is making the edits on the Avid...
LOWELL It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
MIKE WALLACE Good.
Don Hewitt enters from the corridor without jacket.
DON HEWITT I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
LOWELL Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.
LOWELL "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
MIKE WALLACE I like <u>that</u>...
DON HEWITT Corporate has some questions.
DON HEWITT We've got a meeting at Black Rock first thing in the morning.
LOWELL When's the air date?
DEBBIE DELUCA Excuse me, Lowell.
DEBBIE DELUCA Sharon's on line 3.
LOWELL Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
BALDO Here we go.
Baldo now runs Lowell's edit of the above sequence.
And we
Sandefur in CLOSE-UP states "I believe that nicotine is not addictive."
Wigand in matching CLOSE-UP states "I believe he perjured himself."
Then all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco stand up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of Congress to tell the truth while Wallace says "...the whole line of people, the whole line of CEO's up there, all swearing that."
And Wigand says off-screen with great emphasis "Part of the reason I'm here is I FELT"...and it cuts to Wigand for a pause that makes the word "FELT" resound and, then, he goes on to say on-camera "that their representation clearly <u>misstated</u> what they commonly knew.
We're a nicotine delivery business."
We see the combination of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity that's stirring and beautiful...
We see an anonymous rental car moving through downtown Louisville.
It's Jeffrey in the front seat, driven by one of his security men.
He's coming home under the cover of darkness.
They pass a FLAMING CAR on the freeway shoulder.
Jeffrey turns to stare at it.
They turn off onto city streets and stop at a light.
Jeffrey's nervous.
Jeffrey instinctively turns.
A Police Car stops alongside.
The Policeman looks at him.
Eyes meet.
Jeffrey looks away.
The signal takes forever.
It changes.
And as the Police Car moves off...
The car's stopped at the curb.
Jeffrey gets out.
He starts up the walk, and the Second Security Guard quickly crosses the lawn to intercept him...
And Jeff opens the door going inside, anxious to be home...
The house is quiet, dark.
Too quiet.
Too dark.
Something isn't right.
He crosses to one of the children's rooms...the master bedroom.
The lights are on.
Both rooms are empty.
He goes into the kitchen and sees a note that's been left for him...
He opens it.
He sits heavily in a chair, reading the note.
The Security Guard peers...
And as Jeffrey sits in the silent house, the hero come home...
We're at a table.
Mike and Lowell laugh at some joke while HELEN CAPERELLI, CBS GENERAL COUNSEL, enters with the President of CBS News, ERIC KLUSTER.
HELEN CAPERELLI Shall I send for coffee?
HELEN CAPERELLI Sorry I'm late.
MIKE WALLACE No, no, we're fine...
HELEN CAPERELLI Are you sure?
Also there is Don Hewitt.
Caperelli is too well put together, too practiced, too polished.
They nod.
They don't need coffee.
HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D) Alright, I thought we'd get together because there's a legal concept that has been getting some new attention recently, "tortious interference."
HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D) If two people have an agreement, like a confidentiality agreement, and one of them breaks it because they are induced to do so by a 3rd party, the 3rd party can be sued for damages for interfering...hence, "tortious interference."
DON HEWITT Interfering?
DON HEWITT That's what we do.
LOWELL I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time.
LOWELL This is a news organization.
LOWELL People are always telling us things they shouldn't.
LOWELL We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest...
LOWELL And if it is, we air it.
MIKE WALLACE After we corroborate it.
MIKE WALLACE That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.
MIKE WALLACE Anything else?
HELEN CAPERELLI <u>And</u> "60 Minutes'" verification <u>is</u> exact.
HELEN CAPERELLI <u>And</u> precise.
HELEN CAPERELLI <u>And</u> I don't think it would hurt to make <u>sure</u> you're right...on this one.
DON HEWITT Why?
DON HEWITT You think we have liability?
DON HEWITT What's the CBS News' position, Eric?
ERIC KLUSTER There's a possibility, it's rather remote...
HELEN CAPERELLI But one we have to check on, Mike.
HELEN CAPERELLI I've retained outside counsel to do exactly that.
HELEN CAPERELLI On a segment, I might add, that's already rife with problems...
LOWELL What does that mean?
LOWELL "Rife with -- ?"
HELEN CAPERELLI I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
LOWELL No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
HELEN CAPERELLI And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
LOWELL His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
HELEN CAPERELLI Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we <u>are</u> the standard...<u>for</u> everyone else...
Whatever that means...
LOWELL Well, as a "standard"...I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
HELEN CAPERELLI Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid...the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
LOWELL Come again?
HELEN CAPERELLI They <u>own</u> the information he's disclosing.
HELEN CAPERELLI The truer it is, the greater the damage to them.
HELEN CAPERELLI If he lied, he didn't disclose <u>their</u> information.
HELEN CAPERELLI And the damages are smaller.
LOWELL Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?
MIKE WALLACE You said "on this one."
MIKE WALLACE What about "this one"?
And Lowell hears a changed note in Wallace's voice.
After a beat.
HELEN CAPERELLI If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike...but, if it did.
HELEN CAPERELLI And we aired this segment?
HELEN CAPERELLI And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson?
HELEN CAPERELLI I think we could be at grave risk.
MIKE WALLACE How grace?
HELEN CAPERELLI Well, at the end of the day...because of your segment...the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company...could <u>own</u> CBS.
As if on cue, the alarm on Helen Caperelli's watch beeps.
She glances at it.
HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D) You know, I am sorry.
HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D) But I'm due upstairs.
She gets up, gathering her things.
LOWELL Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
HELEN CAPERELLI You're getting ahead of yourself.
HELEN CAPERELLI We're <u>all</u> in this together.
HELEN CAPERELLI We're <u>all</u> CBS.
HELEN CAPERELLI We'll find out soon.
HELEN CAPERELLI Thank you, gentlemen.
And taking up her briefcase, she leaves.
Don and Mike rise.
LOWELL "Tortious interference"?
LOWELL Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
DON HEWITT Lunch?
MIKE WALLACE Sure.
MIKE WALLACE Don't worry, we call the shots around here.
Lowell finds himself angry and alone.
He crosses to the window and pulls out his cell phone and goes to work.
DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER) Hello?
LOWELL Debbie, it's me.
LOWELL I want you to check some filings and give me John Wilson's number at Bear-Stern.
LOWELL What now?
DON HEWITT Kluster's coming over.
Hewitt's on an unrelated call.
Lowell crosses to look out the window, a manila folder (the filing) under his arm with whatever he found out, like a bomb, feels distant from these people.
The door opens, and Eric Kluster, the President of CBS News enters...
ERIC KLUSTER Hello, Lowell, Mike, Don.
Hewitt hangs up the phone.
ERIC KLUSTER (CONT'D) There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show <u>without</u> his interview.
LOWELL So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
ERIC KLUSTER That's happening.
ERIC KLUSTER And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
LOWELL I'm not touching my film...
ERIC KLUSTER I'm afraid you are.
LOWELL No, I'm not...
ERIC KLUSTER We're doing this with or without you, Lowell.
ERIC KLUSTER If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...
Lowell's stunned.
He looks like he's been hit with a hammer...
LOWELL Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
DON HEWITT It's an alternate version.
DON HEWITT So what if we have an alternate version?
DON HEWITT And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
ERIC KLUSTER So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.
As they start to leave...
LOWELL Before you go...
And Lowell takes out...
LOWELL (CONT'D) I discovered this.
LOWELL (CONT'D) SEC filing...
LOWELL (CONT'D) For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
MIKE WALLACE What?
DON HEWITT Yeah, I heard rumors.
LOWELL It's not a rumor.
LOWELL It's a sale.
LOWELL If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
ERIC KLUSTER And what are you implying?
LOWELL I'm not implying.
LOWELL I'm quoting.
LOWELL More vested interests...
LOWELL "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...
LOWELL Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million.
LOWELL Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
DON HEWITT Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
LOWELL Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money.
LOWELL They work for free.
LOWELL And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
DON HEWITT CBS does not do that.
DON HEWITT And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
LOWELL No, I'm questioning your hearing!
LOWELL You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference."
LOWELL I hear...
LOWELL "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse."
LOWELL I hear...
LOWELL "Shut the segment down.
LOWELL Cut Wigand loose.
LOWELL Obey orders.
LOWELL And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
DON HEWITT You're exaggerating!
LOWELL I am?
LOWELL You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out.
LOWELL To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television.
LOWELL I do.
LOWELL I deliver him.
LOWELL He sits.
LOWELL He talks.
LOWELL He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement.
LOWELL And he's only the key witness in the <u>biggest</u> public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history.
LOWELL And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth?
LOWELL Yes.
LOWELL Is it newsworthy?
LOWELL Yes.
LOWELL Are we gonna air it?
LOWELL Of course not.
LOWELL Why?
LOWELL Because he's not telling the truth?
LOWELL No.
LOWELL Because he <u>is</u> telling the truth.
LOWELL That's why we're not going to air it.
LOWELL And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
DON HEWITT You are a fanatic.
DON HEWITT An anarchist.
DON HEWITT You know that?
DON HEWITT If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show.
DON HEWITT But oh, no, not you.
DON HEWITT You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
LOWELL C'mon, what are you?
LOWELL And are you a businessman?
LOWELL Or are you a newsman?!
LOWELL Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
MIKE WALLACE Lowell.
LOWELL "Put the corporation at risk"...?
LOWELL Give me a fucking break!
MIKE WALLACE Lowell.
LOWELL These people are putting <u>our whole reason</u> for <u>doing what we do</u>...on the line!
MIKE WALLACE Lowell!
LOWELL What?
MIKE WALLACE I'm with Don on this.
And there it is.
We see Sharon in a vegetable garden in their side yard...
She turns, seeing him standing behind her...
After a moment.
She knows.
SHARON What's wrong?
LOWELL They're killing the Wigand interview...
SHARON What?!
LOWELL They're pretending it's process.
LOWELL Bullshit, it's foregone.
SHARON What are you and Mike going to do?
LOWELL I'm alone on this...
SHARON Oh, baby...
And the phone RINGS...
Sharon goes in the house to get it...
She comes back out...
SHARON (CONT'D) Jeffrey Wigand...
LOWELL Jeffrey...
And we see Wigand looking rough, unshaven, sitting on a couch in a hotel room.
And we see his belongings, clothing, some boxes, a bottle of vodka, his computer, what's left of his world, are around the room.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Jeffrey, how are you?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) How's the family, okay?
WIGAND There is - there is no family.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) What do you mean there is no family?
WIGAND Liane has filed for divorce...
And Lowell's dead quiet.
WIGAND And, so, I moved out...
WIGAND I see the girls a couple of days a week...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Where you staying now?
WIGAND Our favorite hotel, honey...
WIGAND I checked into Room 930.
WIGAND Odd choice?
WIGAND Huh?
And we don't know what he means by that...
The last of the daylight shadows his office.
LOWELL I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it.
LOWELL They do not <u>want</u> to air it.
WIGAND What?!
LOWELL B & W may have threatened litigation...
LOWELL CBS is on the block...
LOWELL But you, I mean, I know how...
WIGAND No.
LOWELL No?
LOWELL No, what?
WIGAND I do not think that you "know" for me...what it is to walk in <u>my</u> shoes...
WIGAND ...for my kids to have seen it...for them to know why I've put them through what I did...the public airing of that...the testament to why I did what I did...you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
Lowell's quiet.
And Jeffrey starts to hang up...
LOWELL Jeff...
And Jeffrey hangs up.
Jeffrey silently sitting in the chair.
We COME AROUND and see why he's been purposely sitting there.
Why he's chosen this room.
Directly across the street is the Brown & Williamson Building.
The lights are on.
The building lit up.
And in an upstairs office Brown & Williamson lawyers, moving around a conference room, talking.
And as Jeffrey looks out the window...
A peaceful, suburban street.
Small houses.
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR (P.I.)
from IGI, in a raincoat, getting out of a car, going up the walk.
He knocks on the door.
Some moments.
A Woman in her late forties, handicapped, in an electric cart answers the door...
P.I. Mrs. Wigand?
THE WOMAN It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand for some time.
P.I. Well, I'm an investigator and I was - I was wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions about that?
THE WOMAN Alright...
And on a TELEVISION SCREEN, SUSAN WIGAND, the woman in the electric cart, giving a taped interview to the P.I....
SUSAN WIGAND ...seven months after we were married we found out that I had multiple sclerosis...
We PULL BACK to see John Scanlon and his Staff watching the tape...
His firm's logo, public relations campaigns for some of his high-profile clients are on the walls.
Scanlon's on the phone talking with somebody as the tape runs...
P.I.'S VOICE (OVER) And, you had a daughter, Diane, with him, is that correct?
SUSAN WIGAND Yes, in 1973.
JOHN SCANLON ...come on, Tommy Sandefur told me himself, he's not gonna allow Brown & Williamson to be demonized to the American public, so I told Peter Jennings and I...hold on...
He stops, listening to the videotape...
P.I.'S VOICE (OVER) Would it be fair to say when he divorced you he left you in a precarious situation?
P.I.'S VOICE (OVER) You had multiple sclerosis; you had a small child to raise.
JOHN SCANLON Mention that part in the executive summary and in the chapters "First Wife" and "Estrangement of Daughter."
JOHN SCANLON So, I was telling Pete, I said, "You've been taken in by this guy...
SUSAN WIGAND Yes...
SUSAN WIGAND But you have to understand, the divorce was something that we both wanted...
JOHN SCANLON He's a total bullshit artist.
JOHN SCANLON He's a shoplifter.
JOHN SCANLON He's a convicted shoplifter.
And as we end in a sea of documents, affidavits, court records, all from Louisville, all about Jeffrey.
We understand the war has only been begun...
Lowell, in his office, his door open for anyone to see him, an immovable force, sitting behind his desk.
Hewitt appears in his doorway...
DON HEWITT So, what are you going to do?
LOWELL Well, what do you think I'm going to do?
LOWELL Quit in protest?
LOWELL I'm not going to do that.
DON HEWITT You're taking "no" for an answer?
LOWELL No.
LOWELL I'm <u>not</u> going to take "no" for an answer.
LOWELL No.
DON HEWITT Then what <u>are</u> you going to do?
Hewitt looks at him...
LOWELL I'm staying right here.
LOWELL Doing my job.
LOWELL Fighting to get my show on the air.
LOWELL You don't like it?
LOWELL Hey, I'll tell you what...<u>fire</u> my ass...
DON HEWITT End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr?
DON HEWITT I don't think so.
DON HEWITT Take a look at this...
DON HEWITT This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
And he gives him a copy of it.
DON HEWITT (CONT'D) He would lie about his whole life...?
DON HEWITT (CONT'D) Who's going to believe him about anything he says...?
DON HEWITT (CONT'D) The Wall Street Journal's doing a major story and I think the Post.
DON HEWITT (CONT'D) You backed the wrong horse...
He turns and starts off along the hall.
As he goes...
DON HEWITT (cont'd) The version without his interview is going to air the week after next.
Lowell watches him walk away.
Debbie enters.
DEBBIE DELUCA What was that about?
LOWELL Get me Wigand.
DEBBIE DELUCA Sure.
LOWELL ...fuck is this?
LOWELL Fuck!
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) You never told me you were married before...that you had a daughter...
And Wigand is in the phone booth at the High School...students walking by...
WIGAND Well, how is that any of your business?!
WIGAND That is not something that you people need to know!
His voice carries, a student looks over...
LOWELL Oh, you know what we <u>do</u> or <u>do not</u> need to know?
LOWELL Since when have you become a media expert?
WIGAND What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
And he realizes he's said it too loud, a couple of passing students stop, looking at him...
LOWELL Oh, my God.
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) You're not even on this anymore...
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) What do you care?
LOWELL Jeff!
LOWELL Wake the fuck up!
LOWELL Everybody is on the line here.
LOWELL If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush.
LOWELL Do you understand?
LOWELL Everything you say!
WIGAND I told the truth!
LOWELL <u>Everything</u>...you...<u>say</u>!
LOWELL And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back!
LOWELL Because you keep from me...what they can discover.
LOWELL And they <u>will</u> discover everything!
LOWELL Believe me.
Wigand's quiet.
He looks out the phone booth.
After some moments...
WIGAND ...I was young.
WIGAND I was young...confused...
WIGAND We didn't handle it the right way...
LOWELL She sued you for back payments of child support?
WIGAND She did not sue me.
WIGAND We had a dispute over money...
WIGAND I settled it, she dropped the complaint...
WIGAND Any other questions?
And we'll go back and forth...
LOWELL Yes.
LOWELL Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
WIGAND What?
LOWELL Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview...where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
WIGAND What kind of shit is this?
WIGAND I was not <u>on</u> the team, I <u>sparred</u> with the Olympic Team...okay?
And we see, unbeknownst to Wigand, the P.I. in the raincoat, who interviewed his ex-wife, coming out of an administration office, walking towards us along the hallways...
LOWELL Alright...the ABC Telemarketing Company?
LOWELL ABC Telemarketing Company.
WIGAND A can opener!
WIGAND A $39.95 can opener.
WIGAND I cancelled payment...
WIGAND It was junk.
WIGAND You ever bounce a check, Lowell?
WIGAND You ever look at another woman's tits?
WIGAND You ever cheat a little on your taxes?
WIGAND Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
The P.I. in the raincoat passes Jeffrey, now, and doesn't even glance at him...
LOWELL That's the <u>whole</u> point, Jeffrey.
LOWELL That's the whole point.
LOWELL Anyone's.
LOWELL Everyone's.
LOWELL They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made.
LOWELL They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man.
LOWELL Don't you understand?
WIGAND What does this have to do with my testimony?
LOWELL That's not the point.
WIGAND What does this have to do with my testimony?!
WIGAND I told the truth!
WIGAND It's valid and true and provable!
LOWELL That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not!
LOWELL Hello...?
WIGAND I told the truth...
WIGAND I told the truth.
And Wigand's quiet, a deep, dark depression.
The school bell RING snaps him out of it...
WIGAND I've got to teach class.
WIGAND I've got to go.
WIGAND I've got to teach class.
LOWELL And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.
LOWELL I am trying to protect you, man!
Wigand's quiet.
WIGAND Well, I hope you improve your batting average.
And he SLAMS the phone down.
And as he stands in the phone booth, like a man in a glass booth, all alone...
ON the door to the roof.
It SLAMS open.
An enraged Lowell enters and walks out into the cold rain.
Like a prize- fighter, shoulders hunched against the cold, he buries his hands in his jacket pockets.
He crosses to the edge of the roof high above the city.
He's pissed off.
He takes out his cell phone.
He dials...
Lowell hears background NOISE...
Twenty sub-editors and section heads sit and stand in a clear area...
One of them, a large man, is CHARLIE PHILLIPS on a cell phone.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS Hello?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) It's Lowell.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Are you guys planning to do a piece on a former top executive in Big Tobacco?
CHARLIE PHILLIPS You caught me in a news meeting.
LOWELL Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
CHARLIE PHILLIPS You bet we are.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS And I can't talk to you now.
LOWELL We gotta hook up.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS Sure.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS Where?
LOWELL P.J.'s.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS I'll be there.
A busy New York street.
Light mist.
And we see Lowell is on the phone in a phone booth...
LOWELL Yeah, I got it.
LOWELL 500 pages of it.
LOWELL They looked in every corner of this guy's life...from a spousal abuse charge, to shoplifting, to a traffic ticket he got once for running a red light.
LOWELL It's Terry Lenzner's outfit, IGI.
LOWELL Jack, listen to me.
LOWELL Their strategy: discredit this guy, ruin his reputation in The Wall Street Journal, and then nobody will ever listen to what he's got to say about tobacco.
LOWELL He's dead.
LOWELL Unless I can get this thing knocked down.
A townhouse with a commanding view of the Bay.
And we see a broad-shouldered man in his late forties sitting at a desk on the phone.
JACK PALLADINO.
His wife, SANDRA SUTHERLAND, sitting across from him on another phone.
They're Private Investigators...
LOWELL To make it even a little more attractive, I don't know if you're ever gonna get paid.
SANDRA SUTHERLAND Is there any truth to any of it?
LOWELL That's a good question.
LOWELL "Is there any truth to any of it?" I doubt it.
PALLADINO What's their deadline?
LOWELL Soon.
Palladinos exchange looks; she nods.
PALLADINO Fax me the summary.
LOWELL That's great, Jack.
Lowell hangs up and walks towards us to enter...
CLOSE on Lowell entering, moving through the crowd of sports writers, feature writers, sub-editors, etc.
He comes upon a rugged-featured man, JIM COOPER from The New York Times, sitting next to Charlie.
JIM COOPER Hey, Lowell.
LOWELL How are you, Jim?
JIM COOPER Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
Lowell looks at Cooper quizzically.
LOWELL Really?
LOWELL Hi, Joan.
Just then Jim's wife enters.
They exchange greetings.
JIM COOPER Hi, baby.
LOWELL Catch you later.
Cooper and his wife leave.
Charlie and Lowell are <u>alone</u> in the crowded bar.
LOWELL (CONT'D) When's your deadline?
CHARLIE PHILLIPS Monday.
LOWELL Push it.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS What?
CHARLIE PHILLIPS Forget it.
LOWELL It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
LOWELL Oh, it's real selective...about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
LOWELL And it's bullshit.
LOWELL And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
CHARLIE PHILLIPS I'll take a look at what you got.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
That's the way it lays.
In a different, personal tone...
CHARLIE PHILLIPS (cont'd) Are you all right?
LOWELL Yeah.
LOWELL Catch you later.
And we see a Policeman sitting at the counter having a cup of coffee...
SANDRA SUTHERLAND Officer Murabchick?
He turns as Sandra Sutherland sits at the counter to the left of him.
SANDRA SUTHERLAND (cont'd) Officer Muravchick.
SANDRA SUTHERLAND (cont'd) How are you?
SANDRA SUTHERLAND (cont'd) I'm Sandra Sutherland.
POLICEMAN How do you do?
SANDRA SUTHERLAND Fine, thank you.
SANDRA SUTHERLAND I'm doing a background check.
SANDRA SUTHERLAND Mind if I sit down?
An older Man is on the bench.
He's just recessed his court.
As everybody streams out, going against the tide is Jack Palladino.
He approaches the judge, crossing to a side door...
PALLADINO Your honor, could I have a word with you?
PALLADINO You presided in a dispute over support payments...
POLICEMAN Jeffrey Wigand?
POLICEMAN Yeah, I cited him.
DAN RATHER CBS is under criticism, because the CBS News program "60 Minutes" will not be presenting an interview...
Lowell's destroying his own work product, taking apart his creation that we saw earlier to be so impactful.
Tony gets a call as Hewitt enters.
DON HEWITT What the hell are you doing?
LOWELL What does it look like I'm doing?
LOWELL I'm editing.
DON HEWITT No, not that.
DON HEWITT I'm talking about the Associated Press.
DON HEWITT They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
LOWELL No.
LOWELL I <u>should</u> have.
LOWELL I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original.
LOWELL I'm not lying for you.
LOWELL I'm not gonna shut up for you.
LOWELL Not on any of it.
DON HEWITT Hey!
DON HEWITT I'm not going to fire you, okay?
DON HEWITT Take a vacation.
DON HEWITT Now!
A suitcase is on the floor.
Lowell, finishing packing up his things from his office.
MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) Lowell.
MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) I decided to preface Sunday's show.
MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) I did three minutes on the "Evening News."
MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) You'll want to see it.
MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) Where you going?
And he sees Wallace has stopped at his door...
LOWELL I've been banished.
LOWELL In lieu of being fired.
MIKE WALLACE I took off on Tisch.
MIKE WALLACE I took off on corporate.
MIKE WALLACE They'll know they're <u>not</u> going to see <u>everything</u> on Sunday night...
LOWELL I don't know.
LOWELL How does that get Wigand on the air?
MIKE WALLACE Do me a favor, will you?
MIKE WALLACE Spare me, for God's sake.
MIKE WALLACE Get in the real world.
MIKE WALLACE What do you think?
MIKE WALLACE I'm going to resign in protest?
MIKE WALLACE To force it on the air?
MIKE WALLACE The answer is "no."
MIKE WALLACE I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.
MIKE WALLACE That decision I've already made.
VOICE It just started, Mike...
Wallace waves Lowell's remark aside and exits.
We dwell on Lowell until he exits...
...into the hall.
Dan Rather introduced Mike.
As Lowell exits, we SEE Hewitt, Kluster and Caperelli outside of Hewitt's office watching...
Lowell, disgusted, <u>takes a</u> <u>cursory look and moves towards the elevator</u>.
But he hears...
MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) Where's the rest?
MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) Where the hell's the rest?!!
Lowell turns to see Wallace shouting up at the monitors in disbelief...
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) You cut it!
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) You cut the guts out of what I <u>said</u>...!
Wallace moves in on Kluster...
ERIC KLUSTER It was a time consideration, Mike...
MIKE WALLACE Time?
MIKE WALLACE Bullshit!
MIKE WALLACE You corporate lackey!
MIKE WALLACE Who told you your incompetent little fingers had the requisite skills to edit me!
MIKE WALLACE I'm trying to Band-Aid a situation, here, and you're too dim to...
HELEN CAPERELLI Mike...
HELEN CAPERELLI Mike...
HELEN CAPERELLI Mike...
MIKE WALLACE "Mike?"
It was a big mistake.
Now, he turns on her.
Zeroing in, getting closer...
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) "Mike?" Try "Mr.
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) Wallace."
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) We work in the same corporation doesn't mean we work in the same profession.
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) What are you gonna do now?
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) You gonna finesse me?
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) Lawyer me some more?
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) I've been in this profession fifty fucking years.
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) You and the people you work for are destroying the most-respected, the highest-rated, the most-profitable show on this network!
A Range Rover pulls up.
Charlie Phillips gets out.
He crosses to Lowell who's been waiting by his own taxi.
LOWELL Here.
He hands Charlie a folder with the brown notebook inside that is the partially complete Palladino/Sutherland/Lowell work product.
LOWELL (CONT'D) These are their leads, their sources.
LOWELL (CONT'D) I want you to have your reporters...
CHARLIE PHILLIPS Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
LOWELL Have them make their <u>own</u> calls.
LOWELL They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...
LOWELL Push the deadline, Charlie...
Charlie starts looking through the Palladino/ Sutherland/Lowell work product.
Meanwhile...
CHARLIE PHILLIPS I'll push it for a week.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS Let Milo and Suein go through it.
LIANE What do you want to buy him for a gift?
BARBARA He's into kind of little cars, that...
LIANE That remote control thing?
BARBARA Yeah.
LIANE Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
BARBARA Mom.
LIANE Yes, baby?
BARBARA There's Dad, on TV.
And we see Jeffrey in a quiet Bar.
The television's on, the sound low, the midday news.
As Jeffrey looks up and sees his photograph on TELEVISION.
In his LOCAL WORLD the impact is:
LOCAL NEWSCASTER And in local news, WLKO Louisville has gained access to a five-hundred-page dossier on former Brown & Williamson research head Jeffrey Wigand detailing charges of spousal abuse, shoplifting...
And Jeffrey looks as if something just detonated inside of him.
And Jeffrey sitting alone in the hotel, watching the show...
MIKE WALLACE "...thousands of documents from inside the tobacco industry have surfaced over the past year, documents that appear to confirm what a former..."
And as we look at Jeffrey's face, set in stone...
MIKE WALLACE "...US Surgeon General and the current head of the Food and Drug Administration have been saying.
MIKE WALLACE We learned of..."
And Don Hewitt in his house in the Hamptons, alone in his bedroom, watching the show...
MIKE WALLACE "...a tobacco insider who could tell us whether or not the tobacco industry has been leveling with the public..."
MIKE WALLACE "...that insider was formerly a highly- placed executive with a tobacco company..."
MIKE WALLACE "...but we cannot broadcast what critical information about tobacco, addiction and public health he might be able to offer.
MIKE WALLACE Why?
MIKE WALLACE Because he had to sign a confidentiality agreement with the tobacco company he worked for..."
Mike Wallace is in his study, watching the show alone.
As we slowly move in on Mike, seeing himself on television...
MIKE WALLACE "The management of CBS has told us that knowing he had that agreement..."
And the look on his face says: HE DOES NOT LIKE THIS.
Lowell silently watching the broadcast...
MIKE WALLACE "...if were to broadcast an interview with him, CBS could be faced with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit..."
Jeffrey, watching the show...
MIKE WALLACE (on "60 Minutes," from the interview with Wigand...)
MIKE WALLACE "The fact is, we are not allowed even to mention his name or the name of the company he worked for and, of course, we cannot show you his face...
MIKE WALLACE '...and your confidentiality agreement with...(blip) is still in force?'"
And all we can hear is an ELECTRONICALLY-ALTERED VOICE and the BLANKED-OUT image of a man...
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) "Yes, it is."
MIKE WALLACE "So, what are they gonna do?
MIKE WALLACE Sue you for making this appearance?"
WIGAND "I would bet on it."
MIKE WALLACE "The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
Jeffrey, motionless...
A man, no longer with a <u>face</u> or a <u>voice</u>...
And as he gets up, and quietly turns off the television...
Wallace, hasn't moved, still in his chair.
He stares, ignoring the CBS programming, on the phone, making a call...
Lowell, walking up the sand, his cell phone rings.
LOWELL Yeah.
MIKE WALLACE You disappeared on me.
MIKE WALLACE How long you staying?
LOWELL I disappeared on you?
MIKE WALLACE Alright.
MIKE WALLACE What did you think?
LOWELL I think it was a disgrace.
The look on Wallace's face says he thinks so, too.
It's obvious.
He hangs up the phone.
Lowell is on the phone, now.
The moon lights the water, the empty beach.
He listens as a phone, through STATIC, RINGS and RINGS and RINGS.
And we hear the phone RINGING.
We slowly PAN across the hotel room.
We see on the floor a pair of men's tasseled loafers...
A discarded sport jacket...
And we see Jeffrey, barefoot, sitting in a chair in the center of the room.
He's looking out the window at B&W.
The curtains are blowing...
And he's still...
The sound of the phone RINGING and
AN OPERATOR'S VOICE (OVER) Sir, there's still no answer in that room.
LOWELL Alright.
LOWELL Get me the manager's office...
HOTEL DESK CLERK David?
HOTEL DESK CLERK David, you've got a call on line 4.
HOTEL DESK CLERK I think you better take it.
A thin Man answers the phone.
THE HOTEL MANAGER This is David MacDougal.
THE HOTEL MANAGER How can I help you?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Mr. MacDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) I'm a producer for "60 Minutes"...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) I'm concerned with a friend of mine who's staying at your hotel right now.
And we see the Hotel Manager, walking along with a Security Guard, and now <u>KNOCKING</u> on Jeffrey's door...
And when there is no response, the Manager nods to the Security Guard, the Guard using a pass key, unlocking the door.
But the door stops, the chain-lock drawn.
The Manager looks in through the chain...and he can see Jeffrey sitting in the chair...
THE HOTEL MANAGER Mr. Wigand?
THE HOTEL MANAGER Mr. Wigand?
Jeffrey's still.
The Manager quickly takes a cell phone from the Security Guard.
Lowell, standing on the beach anxiously waiting.
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER) I think I need to call the police.
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER) He won't respond...
LOWELL No, no.
LOWELL Don't call the police!
LOWELL Just tell him I'm on the phone with you...
LOWELL My name is Lowell Bergman...
LOWELL Just tell him that.
THE HOTEL MANAGER Mr. Wigand...Mr.
THE HOTEL MANAGER Bergman is on the telephone.
Jeffrey's quiet.
LOWELL Did he hear you?
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER) You're breaking up.
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER) I can't hear you.
Lowell goes deeper into the water.
LOWELL What about now?
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER) What?
LOWELL Hello, can you hear me now?
And now the walls behind MORPH into a green daytime garden, the garden behind his house.
And as we DOLLY AROUND Wigand, more walls MORPH into the side yard, and, turning slowly, he sees Barbara and Deborah in the emerald-green grass.
They stop and smile, then they stare at us, at their father.
And he looks at his children, at an idyll lost...
The chair, the man are the only real objects left in the view from inside his head...
Lowell anxiously moves along the beach, trying to be heard, the phone chattering with static...
LOWELL What's happening?!
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER) He doesn't seem to be listening...
LOWELL Alright, now listen to me.
LOWELL I want you -
I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER) I can't say that!
LOWELL No, you can.
LOWELL Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
THE HOTEL MANAGER He told me to tell you, to get on...the fucking phone...!
And even he's surprised by his language.
And suddenly Jeffrey gets up, unlatches the door, grabs the phone from the Hotel Manager.
Wigand in the hotel corridor, Lowell standing knee-deep in the water...
WIGAND You manipulated me into this...!
LOWELL That's bullshit, Jeff!
WIGAND You greased the rails!
LOWELL I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes.
LOWELL I helped him to say yes.
LOWELL Alright.
LOWELL You're not a robot, Jeff!
LOWELL That's all.
LOWELL You got a mind of your own, don't you?
WIGAND "Up to you, Jeffrey.
WIGAND That's the power you have, Jeffrey.
WIGAND Vital insider information the American public need to know."
WIGAND Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
LOWELL I fought for you...and I still fight for you.
WIGAND You fought for me...?!
WIGAND ...you manipulated me...into where I am now...staring at the Brown & Williamson Building.
WIGAND It's all dark.
WIGAND Except the 10th floor!
WIGAND That's the legal department.
WIGAND That's where they fuck with my life!
LOWELL Jeffrey, where you going with this?
LOWELL So where you goin'?
LOWELL You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey.
LOWELL You think about that.
LOWELL You think about them.
CLOSE ON JEFFREY: standing in the room with the blowing curtains...
LOWELL (CONT'D) I'm running out of heroes, man...
LOWELL (CONT'D) Guys like you are in short supply.
And for the first time, Wigand smiles.
WIGAND Yeah, guys like you, too.
And the grave situation passes.
WIGAND (CONT'D) Where are you, anyway?
LOWELL I'm on a leave of absence.
LOWELL Forced vacation.
WIGAND You try and have a good time.
LOWELL Yeah.
LOWELL Yeah, I will.
Sharon's cooking across the room...
And there's just the sound of the ceiling fan turning.
LOWELL "I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call.
LOWELL Maybe Wigand's right.
LOWELL Maybe I'm hooked.
LOWELL What am I hooked on?
LOWELL The rush?
LOWELL "60 Minutes"?
LOWELL What the hell for?
LOWELL Infotainment.
LOWELL It's so fucking useless, all of it.
SHARON So, it's a big country with a free press.
SHARON You can go work somewhere else.
LOWELL Free press?
LOWELL Press is free...for anyone who owns one.
LOWELL Larry Tisch has a free press.
SHARON Get some perspective, Lowell.
LOWELL I got perspective.
SHARON No, you do not.
LOWELL From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous.
LOWELL It's half-measures.
SHARON You're not listening.
SHARON Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
And as the fan squeaks, turning...
Lowell stares at Sharon.
Between two curved colonnades of SNOW-covered trees drives a rental car.
CLOSER, it's Lowell.
His POV spots a dirty SUV and he pulls into park across from a coffee shop in this out- of-context mountain town.
His pager beeps.
He looks at it.
He detours from the coffee shop to a pay phone on the corner of the Moose Lodge.
DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER) I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone...
LOWELL Patch him through.
RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER) Well, Lowell, you are not going to believe this...
And we see the back of a crowded courtroom.
Richard Scruggs is standing in the rear amongst bailiffs an witnesses, talking on his own cell phone.
RICAHRD SCRUGGS The Governor of Mississippi is suing his <u>own</u> Attorney General...to abandon litigation against Big Tobacco...
LOWELL Oh, good...
Waiting media are relaxing as Scruggs continues to Lowell...
RICHARD SCRUGGS But, now that the version without Jeff ran...what's the chance of getting his interview on the air...?
RICHARD SCRUGGS Hello?
Sudden STATIC.
Scruggs now exits the building, past the metal detector, seeking better reception.
LOWELL Yeah, I'm here.
RICHARD SCRUGGS What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Less than great.
And the courthouse doors suddenly burst open, Michael Moore and his attorneys coming out.
Scruggs comes further down the steps so he can hear, away from Michael Moore who begins answering questions from the Press.
RICHARD SCRUGGS ...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
LOWELL ...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
RICHARD SCRUGGS All right.
RICHARD SCRUGGS See you...
Lowell walks right in and up to a booth and a COUPLE in hiking pants and hiking boots.
They look up at him...
LOWELL Hi.
LOWELL So, what are you folks doing here in Lincoln?
And we sense something is all wrong here.
MAN GEOLOGIST Geology survey.
LOWELL Geology.
LOWELL Yeah?
LOWELL Really?
WOMAN GEOLOGIST How about you?
LOWELL I work for CBS News.
MAN GEOLOGIST Oh, yeah?
Lowell nods.
They look at each other and they both know there's a lot more than meets the eye.
And as Lowell gets up and leaves...
And we see Lowell on the PAY PHONE again.
LOWELL Just ran into two of your "geologists."
LOWELL Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) Lowell?
And we see Bill Robertson's on the phone...
BILL ROBERTSON Do <u>not</u>...screw this up.
BILL ROBERTSON We are a week away from an arrest...
LOWELL So, I'll hold it...
LOWELL And...
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
LOWELL How long?
BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) Three hours.
LOWELL You got a deal.
Lowell is in a T-shirt and sweat pants, sitting in an old, re- upholstered-one-too-many-times chair in a room barely big enough for a chair, a bed and the TV/VCR combo on the cheap dresser.
It's playing Lowell's cut of the full Wigand interview.
He watches the show that will never see the light of day.
MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) "...like the testimony before Congress of Dr. Wigand's former boss, Brown & Williamson's Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Sandefur."
THOMAS SANDEFUR "I believe that nicotine is not addictive."
WIGAND "I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself...
WIGAND Because I watched those testimonies very carefully."
Then it cuts to all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco raising their hands and taking the oath in front of Congress to tell the truth while...
WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) "All of us did...there was this whole like of people, the whole line of CEOs up there, all swearing that."
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) "Part of the reason I'm here is I
And the PAUSE after the word makes "FELT" resound, and as it CUTS TO Jeffrey ON CAMERA saying...
WIGAND (CONT'D) "...that their representation..."
And Lowell FREEZES after the image...
He gets up, looking out the window through the curtain with the spill from the neon motel sign.
Outside are horse trailers.
He goes back to watching the show...standing there...in touch with his own creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in this decision-making process that we feel is critical to him.
Turning, he dials the phone and we intercut with...
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Hello?
LOWELL Jim, it's Lowell.
JIM COOPER Hey!
JIM COOPER Where are you?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Remember that night at P.J.'s?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) You asked me if we were sitting on something "explosive"?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Well, we're not "sitting on" it.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) CBS corporate leaned on CBS News which <u>yanked</u> an interview we did with a top- ranking tobacco scientist.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) A corporate officer.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) They are trying to close down the story.
JIM COOPER You mean, "60 Minutes" is letting CBS corporate decide what is or is not news?
JIM COOPER What's Wallace think about this, or Hewitt, or...?
LOWELL How prominent?
LOWELL What kind of placement?
JIM COOPER Oh, c'mon, Lowell.
JIM COOPER This is The New York Times.
JIM COOPER I don't know...
LOWELL Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know...they will not air an interview.
JIM COOPER Call me back in ten.
Lowell hangs up.
Re-dials.
Debbie answers, intercutting with above...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Debbie.
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) It's me...
DEBBIE DELUCA Hi.
DEBBIE DELUCA What time is it?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Oh, it's late.
DEBBIE DELUCA <u>That</u> I know.
DEBBIE DELUCA When are you coming back?
LOWELL I can't get out of here til mid-morning.
LOWELL I'll be in tomorrow night...
LOWELL Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
DEBBIE DELUCA Okay.
DEBBIE DELUCA Hold on a second...
DEBBIE DELUCA What is it?
Jim Cooper's workstation.
His phone rings.
He grabs it.
JIM COOPER Hello?
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Lowell.
JIM COOPER Alright, Lowell.
JIM COOPER Page one.
JIM COOPER Editorial's interested.
JIM COOPER Let's talk.
LOWELL Here's how it works.
LOWELL You ask me questions.
LOWELL I tell you if you're <u>wrong</u>.
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Okay.
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Lowell?
LOWELL Yeah?
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) You're sure you want to do this?
LOWELL Why?
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Hey, it doesn't work?
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) You've burned your bridges, man.
LOWELL You ready...?
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Okay...
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) About this whistle-blower...
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
No answer.
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)(cont'd) Lowell?
LOWELL Did I tell you you were wrong?
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) No.
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco.
JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Are we talking...are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
MOVING CLOSER into the face of Lowell.
His gaze falters.
His eyes go back to the motel TV mutely frozen on the show.
Whatever he's seeing there, his gaze is steadfast.
Newspaper box is loaded with The New York Times.
Cab pulls to curb and a raincoated Man emerges.
We SEE he carries a copy of this morning's New York Times.
A suitcase is half-unpacked on the floor...a sleeping figure...
There's a knock.
Irritated, a sleeping Lowell gets up to answer it.
He looks through the security peep hole.
He opens it.
And Mike Wallace, a newspaper under his arm, is standing in the doorway.
MIKE WALLACE Did I get you up?
LOWELL No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
There's an awkward quiet.
Mike enters.
He slows, looks around.
MIKE WALLACE How many shows have we done?
MIKE WALLACE Huh?
MIKE WALLACE C'mon, how many?
LOWELL Oh, lots.
MIKE WALLACE Yeah, that's right.
LOWELL But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind?
LOWELL Lost his heart?
LOWELL Walked out on us?
LOWELL Not one fucking time!
LOWELL You want to know why?
MIKE WALLACE I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
LOWELL I'm going to <u>tell</u> you why.
LOWELL Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
MIKE WALLACE Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path.
MIKE WALLACE To show me the way.
LOWELL Oh, please, Mike...
MIKE WALLACE Give me a break!
LOWELL No, <u>you</u> give <u>me</u> a break!
LOWELL I never left a source hung out to dry, ever.
LOWELL Abandoned.
LOWELL Not 'til right fucking now!
LOWELL When I came on this job, I came with my word intact.
LOWELL I'm gonna leave with my word intact.
LOWELL Fuck the rules of the game!
LOWELL Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike.
LOWELL What the hell did you expect?
LOWELL You expect me to lie down?
LOWELL Back off?
LOWELL What, get over it?
MIKE WALLACE In the real world, when you get to where I am, there <u>are</u> other considerations...
LOWELL Like what?
LOWELL Corporate responsibility?
LOWELL What, are we talking celebrity here?
MIKE WALLACE I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS.
MIKE WALLACE I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning.
MIKE WALLACE Now, what do you think you think about then?
MIKE WALLACE The future?
MIKE WALLACE "In the future I'm going to do this?
MIKE WALLACE Become that?" What "future"?
MIKE WALLACE No.
MIKE WALLACE What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end?
MIKE WALLACE After I'm gone.
He trails off.
They look at each other.
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) Now, along the way I suppose I made some <u>minor</u> impact.
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) I did Iran-Gate and the Ayatollah, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Saddam, Sadat, etcetera, etcetera.
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) I showed them thieves in suits.
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) I've spent a lifetime building all that.
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) But history only remembers most what you did last.
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) And should that be fronting a segment that allowed a tobacco giant to crash this network?
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) Does it give someone at my time of life pause?
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) Yeah.
And the look on Wallace's face is "It did.
Whether it should or should not...what difference does that make?
It did."
And we realize only now that he has not come to argue.
LOWELL Mike...in my...
MIKE WALLACE You and I have been doing this together for <u>fourteen years</u>.
And he gives Lowell a copy of The New York Times.
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) This is today's New York Times.
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) In it is the whole sordid story of what went on inside our shop.
Lowell looks down at the page.
The headline is "'60 MINUTES'
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) And in the editorial...
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) It accuses us...of betraying the legacy of Edward R.
MIKE WALLACE (cont'd) Murrow.
Turning, he walks out and down the hallway.
Lowell looks at the newspaper.
The helicopter approaching Manhattan.
John Scanlon sitting with Hewitt, both of them reading The Wall Street Journal Wigand article.
DON HEWITT They conclude most of it seems pretty unsubstantiated...
DON HEWITT You're full of shit, John.
Lowell at a table littered with New York Times, New York Daily News, etc.
His phone rings...
LOWELL Yeah.
Broadway backgrounds streak past Debbie DeLuca's head as she rides, talking on a cell phone, The Wall Street Journal in her hand.
DEBBIE DELUCA ...front page.
DEBBIE DELUCA There's a picture of Wigand.
DEBBIE DELUCA Article's entitled, "Getting Personal," by-lined to Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
DEBBIE DELUCA Wait, hold on a second, Lowell.
Debbie hits "call waiting."
DEBBIE DELUCA (cont'd) Yeah.
DEBBIE DELUCA (cont'd) Yeah, sure.
DEBBIE DELUCA (cont'd) I'll see if I can find him.
DEBBIE DELUCA (cont'd) Hold on...
DEBBIE DELUCA (cont'd) Yeah, Don's looking for you...
LOWELL Good.
DEBBIE DELUCA The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic."
DEBBIE DELUCA It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
EXTREMELY CLOSE Lowell.
DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER) "...a close look at the file, and independent research by this newspaper into its key claims, indicates that many of the serious allegations against Mr.
DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER) Wigand are backed by scant or contradictory evidence..."
As Lowell hails a cab in a WIDE ANGLE and runs towards us, jumping into the cab...
DON HEWITT The news division has been vilified in The New York Times, in print, on television, for caving to corporate interests!
We PULL BACK and we see that Lowell's with Hewitt in Hewitt's office...
DON HEWITT (CONT'D) The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors!
DON HEWITT (CONT'D) You fucked us!
LOWELL No, <u>you</u> fucked <u>you</u>!
LOWELL Don't invert stuff!
LOWELL Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it.
LOWELL The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti- capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination!
LOWELL And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating!
LOWELL Don, what the hell else...do you need?
And Hewitt, looking around.
DON HEWITT Mike, you tell him...
MIKE WALLACE You fucked up, Don.
And Don's taken off stride...
DON HEWITT Hey, it's old news!
DON HEWITT Stick with me.
DON HEWITT Like always, we'll be okay.
DON HEWITT These things have a half-life of fifteen minutes...
MIKE WALLACE No, that's fame.
MIKE WALLACE Fame has a fifteen- minute half-life...
MIKE WALLACE Infamy...lasts a little longer.
Lowell looks at Wallace.
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) We caved.
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) It's foolish.
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) It's simply dead wrong.
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) Now, this is what we're going to do.
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) We're going over to Black Rock...
Jeff is in front of his class, teaching...
WIGAND Okay, so let's get back to it.
WIGAND Alright, now, what we saw there was...
Tired, his suitcase at his feet.
We don't know if he's coming or going.
He's at a pay phone in the more-deserted- than-not airport.
LOWELL They cancelled the six o'clock.
LOWELL I don't know why.
LOWELL I'm on the 8:10.
LOWELL I should be home...9:30.
LOWELL I'll see you then.
LOWELL Love ya'.
LOWELL Bye...
He hangs up and ambles over to a lounge with a few travellers sitting in it.
MIKE WALLACE "CBS Management wouldn't let us broadcast our original story and our interview with Wigand because they were worried about the possibility of a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against us for tortious interference...
MIKE WALLACE But now things have changed."
A small apartment.
Jeffrey dishes out second helpings of pasta primavera into two pasta plates and brings them into the kitchenette to his girls, Deborah and Barbara.
And now we SEE AND HEAR the small television on the table playing "60 Minutes" and...
MICHAEL MOORE "...in my opinion, is an industry that has perpetrated the biggest fraud on the American public in history."
Deborah looks proudly at her father.
Wigand's gotten up and gone out of the kitchenette.
He has stopped for a moment around the corner in the hallway.
His kids can't see him.
We can.
And he watches them and his eyes get shiny and start to tear.
And as he stands there, watching his girls at the kitchen table witnessing their father's hard-earned "truth" on television, we realize that of all the audiences, his girls are the one he cares about most...
And Lowell in his moment of victory is watching his "60 Minutes" double segment on a departure lounge television with his feet resting on his suitcase, next to a Chicano woman with two kids and her mother and an older man with a beard and cane.
An airport cleaner stops to watch, too.
Lowell glances at him...
Unbeknownst to these viewers, arrested by the content on the television screen, is that the man who made it sits casually among them, watching his work.
Sharon sits at the kitchen table.
She watches in a far corner a small countertop television.
It's "60 Minutes," the full show entitled "Jeffrey Wigand, Ph.D."
and on the top right, "PRODUCED BY LOWELL BERGMAN."
As Sharon continues watching the television playing on the counter, the emotional currents within her remaining unrevealed...
INT. MIKE WALLACE'S STUDY - ON MIKE WALLACE - NIGHT watching the show.
He sees himself...
MIKE WALLACE "You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
WIGAND "There are times...I wish I hadn't done it.
WIGAND But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..."
WIGAND "I've - if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's - do I think it's worth it.
WIGAND Yeah.
WIGAND I think it's worth it."
Wallace, satisfied, rises to refill his glass, as...
Lowell watching show in airport.
And we see the FBI Agent, BILL ROBERTSON on the phone.
BILL ROBERTSON I promised you a three-hour heads- up...well, here it is.
BILL ROBERTSON Have a camera crew standing by in Helena, Montana on Tuesday and I'll give you a three-hour head start.
BILL ROBERTSON Alright?
BILL ROBERTSON By the way, that was a hell of a good show tonight...
LOWELL Thank you, Bill.
And he quietly hangs up.
And it's still.
Sharon's laid down, closing her eyes.
They lie close together.
After some moments, she opens her eyes and lets us know what she's been thinking...
SHARON You won.
This time he isn't droll.
LOWELL Yeah?
LOWELL What did I win?
There's an odd look on his face, not the look of a victor.
He shuts off the light.
And as they lie close together in the dark in each other's arms...
Lowell, entering through machine rooms, into a state-of-the- art Master Control Room.
On a wall are fifty or more monitors, in the humidity-and-temperature-controlled nexus of CBS operations.
And it's jammed with people, witnessing a fast-breaking, major news event.
Mike Wallace stands near Felling.
Lowell crosses past Felling and stands next to Mike Wallace.
And we see footage of a handcuffed, bearded, barefoot Man...THEODORE KACZYNSKI, the UNABOMBER, being taken in by the FBI.
A director counts down.
Dan Rather launches...
DAN RATHER "Reporting from CBS World News headquarters in New York, good afternoon.
DAN RATHER There has been a major break in the case of the so-called 'Unabomber.' CBS News has learned that a remote homesite outside Lincoln, Montana has been under FBI surveillance..."
BILL FELLING Thanks for this.
BILL FELLING You know, we beat everybody.
BILL FELLING ABC, NBC, CNN.
Mike motions Lowell out into the corridor so they can be alone.
The control room and crowd are seen through the glass wall.
After some moments:
MIKE WALLACE That Canada story?
MIKE WALLACE Still interest you?
LOWELL Everything interests me.
Mike nods...
Lowell puts his hands in his jacket pockets...
After some moments...
LOWELL (CONT'D) I quit, Mike.
Mike's startled.
MIKE WALLACE Bullshit.
Lowell shakes his head "no."
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) C'mon, it all worked out.
MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) You came out okay in the end...
LOWELL I did?
LOWELL What do I tell a source on the next tough story?
LOWELL Hang in with us.
LOWELL You'll be fine...maybe?
They look at each other.
Lowell says to Mike, intimately, what he knows Mike knows...
LOWELL (cont'd) What got broken here...doesn't go back together again.
Lowell's heartfelt regret.
He starts to leave.
They look at each other.
LOWELL (cont'd) So, uh...
And Lowell moves off along the hallway, the monitors all showing CBS programming.
He doesn't even look back...
