A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title.
War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity.
It is a period of civil war.
Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...
The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness.
A tiny silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space.
It is pursed by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer.
Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.
An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2- D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway.
Both robots are old and battered.
Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod.
His face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.
Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions.
He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco design.
Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.
THREEPIO Did you hear that?
THREEPIO They've shut down the main reactor.
THREEPIO We'll be destroyed for sure.
THREEPIO This is madness!
Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway.
They aim their weapons toward the door.
THREEPIO We're doomed!
The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand.
THREEPIO There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
Artoo continues making beeping sounds.
Tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.
THREEPIO What's that?
The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner.
The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.
The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons.
Suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke-filled corridor.
In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire.
The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions.
Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers.
Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces.
An explosion hits near the robots.
THREEPIO I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots.
A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.
The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years.
His shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile.
A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves.
He is aided by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms.
The little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.
A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt.
He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field).
He motions for the tiny robot to follow him.
LUKE Hurry up!
LUKE Come with me!
LUKE What are you waiting for?!
LUKE Get in gear!
The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every joint.
Luke throws his arms up in disgust.
Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.
The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway.
This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor.
His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers.
Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops.
Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic.
A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.
Artoo makes beeping sounds.
Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered.
Artoo is nowhere in sight.
The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance.
THREEPIO Artoo!
THREEPIO Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke- filled alcove.
A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of Artoo.
Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion.
THREEPIO At last!
THREEPIO Where have you been?
Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.
THREEPIO They're heading in this direction.
THREEPIO What are we going to do?
THREEPIO We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway.
Threepio chases after him.
THREEPIO Wait a minute, where are you going?
Artoo responds with electronic beeps.
The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes.
He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.
IMPERIAL OFFICER The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles in vain.
VADER Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.
VADER What have you done with those plans?
REBEL OFFICER We intercepted no transmissions.
REBEL OFFICER Aaah...
REBEL OFFICER This is a consular ship.
REBEL OFFICER Were on a diplomatic mission.
VADER If this is a consular ship...
VADER were is the Ambassador?
The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.
Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops.
VADER Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.
VADER I want her alive!
The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.
The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship.
She is Princess Leia Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate.
The fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder.
One of the troopers spots her.
TROOPER There she is!
TROOPER Set for stun!
Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser pistol.
She starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray.
The troopers inspect her inert body.
TROOPER She'll be all right.
TROOPER Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod.
He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash.
The stubby astro-robot works his way into the cramped four-man pod.
THREEPIO Hey, you're not permitted in there.
THREEPIO It's restricted.
THREEPIO You'll be deactivated for sure..
Artoo beeps something to him.
THREEPIO Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!
THREEPIO Now come out before somebody sees you.
Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform.
THREEPIO Secret mission?
THREEPIO What plans?
THREEPIO What are you talking about?
THREEPIO I'm not getting in there!
Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps and twangs angrily.
A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway.
Flames lick at Threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod.
THREEPIO I'm going to regret this.
On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.
CHIEF PILOT There goes another one.
CAPTAIN Hold your fire.
CAPTAIN There are no life forms.
CAPTAIN It must have been short- circuited.
Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.
Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.
THREEPIO That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
Artoo beeps an assuring response.
THREEPIO Are you sure this things safe?
Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings.
Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny settlement.
An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past.
WOMAN I've told you kids to slow down!
Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap.
They grumbled as he races through the office, yelling wildly.
FIXER Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
CAMIE It was just wormie on another rampage.
Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, handsome boy a few years older than the rest.
His flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the farm boys.
A robot repairs some equipment in the background.
LUKE Shape it up you guys!...
LUKE Biggs?
Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great joy and emotion.
They give each other a great bear hug.
LUKE I didn't know you were back!
LUKE When did you get in?
BIGGS Just now.
BIGGS I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.
BIGGS I thought you'd be here...
BIGGS certainly didn't expect you to be out working.
LUKE The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon?
LUKE Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?
Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
BIGGS Of course I got it.
BIGGS Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.
BIGGS First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...
BIGGS ...I just came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
Everyone laughs.
The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of it.
LUKE I almost forgot.
LUKE There's a battle going on!
LUKE Right here in our system.
LUKE Come and look!
DEAK Not again!
DEAK Forget it.
DAY
The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun.
Camie and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes.
Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.
LUKE There they are!
Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye.
Through the binoculars Biggs sees two small silver specks.
BIGGS That's no battle, hot shot...
BIGGS they're just sitting there!
BIGGS Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
LUKE But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the building in the process.
Luke grabs them.
LUKE Hey, easy with those...
CAMIE Don't worry about it, Wormie.
The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation.
FIXER I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here.
FIXER I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.
FIXER Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...
Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why.
The group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about Luke's ineptitude.
Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad of armored stormtroopers.
Her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops.
They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader emerges from the shadows.
The sinister Dark Lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.
LEIA Lord Vader, I should have known.
LEIA Only you could be so bold.
LEIA The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
VADER Don't play games with me, Your Highness.
VADER You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
VADER You passed directly through a restricted system.
VADER Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.
VADER I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
LEIA I don't know what you're talking about.
LEIA I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
VADER You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...
VADER and a traitor.
VADER Take her away!
Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship.
An Imperial Commander turns to Vader.
COMMANDER Holding her is dangerous.
COMMANDER If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
VADER I have traced the Rebel spies to her.
VADER Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
COMMANDER She'll die before she tells you anything.
VADER Leave that to me.
VADER Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander.
They stop and snap to attention.
SECOND OFFICER Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!
SECOND OFFICER And no transmissions were made.
SECOND OFFICER An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
Vader turns to the Commander.
VADER She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
VADER Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
VADER See to it personally, Commander.
VADER There'll be no one to stop us this time.
COMMANDER Yes, sir.
The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the planet Tatooine.
Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas meet the foreboding dune sea.
The two helpless astro-droids kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland.
The lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand.
THREEPIO How did I get into this mess?
THREEPIO I really don't know how.
THREEPIO We seem to be made to suffer.
THREEPIO It's our lot in life.
Artoo answers with beeping sounds.
THREEPIO I've got to rest before I fall apart.
THREEPIO My joints are almost frozen.
Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.
THREEPIO What a desolate place this is.
Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas.
Threepio stops and yells at him.
THREEPIO Where are you going?
A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot.
THREEPIO Well, I'm not going that way.
THREEPIO It's much too rocky.
THREEPIO This way is much easier.
Artoo counters with a long whistle.
THREEPIO What makes you think there are settlements over there?
Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
THREEPIO Don't get technical with me.
Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
THREEPIO What mission?
THREEPIO What are you talking about?
THREEPIO I've had just about enough of you!
THREEPIO Go that way!
THREEPIO You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea.
THREEPIO And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.
Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound.
He turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas.
THREEPIO No more adventures.
THREEPIO I'm not going that way.
Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant mountains.
Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless miles.
He looks back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas.
THREEPIO That malfunctioning little twerp.
THREEPIO This is all his fault!
THREEPIO He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.
In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand from his joints.
His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him.
THREEPIO Wait, what's that?
THREEPIO A transport!
THREEPIO I'm saved!
The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport.
THREEPIO Over here!
THREEPIO Help!
THREEPIO Please, help!
Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew.
Fixer and the others can be heard working inside.
LUKE ...so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.
LUKE I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments.
LUKE As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.
LUKE Uncle Owen was pretty upset.
LUKE He grounded me for the rest of the season.
LUKE You should have been there...
LUKE it was fantastic.
BIGGS You ought to take it easy Luke.
BIGGS You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.
BIGGS Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
LUKE Look who's talking.
LUKE Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle.
LUKE You've gotten soft in the city...
BIGGS I've missed you kid.
LUKE Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.
LUKE It's been so...
LUKE quiet.
Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.
BIGGS Luke, I didn't come back just to say good-bye...
BIGGS I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust...
BIGGS and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.
Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.
LUKE What are you talking about?
BIGGS I made some friends at the Academy.
BIGGS ...when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...
Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.
LUKE Join the Rebellion?!
LUKE Are you kidding!
LUKE How?
BIGGS Quiet down will ya!
BIGGS You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
LUKE I'm sorry.
LUKE I'm quiet.
LUKE Listen how quiet I am.
LUKE You can barely hear me...
Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.
BIGGS My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
LUKE You're crazy!
LUKE You could wander around forever trying to find them.
BIGGS I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...
BIGGS It's what we always talked about.
BIGGS Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.
BIGGS The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe in.
LUKE And I'm stuck here...
BIGGS I thought you were going to the Academy next term.
BIGGS You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
LUKE Not likely!
LUKE I had to cancel my application.
LUKE There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left...
LUKE they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
BIGGS Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.
LUKE I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.
LUKE He needs me for just one more season.
LUKE I can't leave him now.
BIGGS I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.
BIGGS What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...
BIGGS You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...
BIGGS it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
LUKE It couldn't happen here.
LUKE You said it yourself.
LUKE The Empire won't bother with this rock.
BIGGS Things always change.
LUKE I wish I was going...
LUKE Are you going to be around long?
BIGGS No, I'm leaving in the morning...
LUKE Then I guess I won't see you.
BIGGS Maybe someday...
BIGGS I'll keep a lookout.
LUKE Well, I'll be at the Academy next season...
LUKE after that who knows.
LUKE I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...
LUKE Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.
BIGGS So long, Luke.
Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the power station.
The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air.
Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes.
He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment.
Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows.
A little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path.
The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow.
He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back.
His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again.
Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than Artoo.
They holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot.
They wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen.
They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail.
The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank- like vehicle the size of a four-story house.
They weld a small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine.
The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.
It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler.
Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap.
The narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots.
He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber.
Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling.
In the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes.
Some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about.
A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom.
THREEPIO Artoo-Detoo!
THREEPIO It's you!
THREEPIO It's you!
A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.
The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge.
Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half- buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine.
A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.
FIRST TROOPER Someone was in the pod.
FIRST TROOPER The tracks go off in this direction.
A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand and gives it to the first trooper.
SECOND TROOPER Look, sir -- droids.
The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.
Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison chamber.
Artoo appears to be shut off.
THREEPIO Wake up!
THREEPIO Wake up!
Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.
Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping.
At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white light.
a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots.
THREEPIO We're doomed.
A Jawa starts moving toward them.
THREEPIO Do you think they'll melt us down?
Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.
THREEPIO Don't shoot!
THREEPIO Don't shoot!
THREEPIO Will this never end?
The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house.
The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow.
The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be.
Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties.
His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face.
As the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker.
One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead.
Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard.
BERU Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
LUKE It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the Jawa leader.
OWEN I have no need for a protocol droid.
THREEPIO Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
OWEN What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
THREEPIO Vaporators!
THREEPIO Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...
THREEPIO very similar to your vaporators.
THREEPIO You could say...
OWEN Do you speak Bocce?
THREEPIO Of course I can, sir.
THREEPIO It's like a second language for me...
THREEPIO I'm as fluent in Bocce...
OWEN All right shut up!
OWEN I'll take this one.
THREEPIO Shutting up, sir.
OWEN Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?
OWEN I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
LUKE But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
OWEN You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.
OWEN Now come on, get to it!
LUKE All right, come on!
LUKE And the red one, come on.
LUKE Well, come on, Red, let's go.
As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio.
He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.
Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa.
Luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.
LUKE Uncle Owen...
OWEN Yeah?
LUKE This R2 unit has a bad motivator.
LUKE Look!
OWEN Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
The Jawa goes into a loud spiel.
Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention.
He lets out with a low whistle.
Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder.
THREEPIO Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.
THREEPIO A real bargain.
LUKE Uncle Owen...
OWEN Yeah?
LUKE What about that one?
OWEN What about that blue one?
OWEN We'll take that one.
With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro-droid for Artoo.
LUKE Yeah, take it away.
THREEPIO Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.
THREEPIO He really is in first-class condition.
THREEPIO I've worked with him before.
THREEPIO Here he comes.
Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.
LUKE Okay, let's go.
THREEPIO Now, don't you forget this!
THREEPIO Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber.
Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil.
Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face.
THREEPIO Thank the maker!
THREEPIO This oil bath is going to feel so good.
THREEPIO I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
Artoo beeps a muffled reply.
Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage.
Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench.
LUKE It just isn't fair.
LUKE Oh, Biggs is right.
LUKE I'm never gonna get out of here!
THREEPIO Is there anything I might do to help?
Luke glances at the battered robot.
A bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.
LUKE Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
THREEPIO I don't think so, sir.
THREEPIO I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.
THREEPIO Not on this planet, anyways.
THREEPIO As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
LUKE Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
THREEPIO I see, sir.
LUKE Uh, you can call me Luke.
THREEPIO I see, sir Luke.
LUKE Just Luke.
THREEPIO And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
LUKE Hello.
Artoo beeps in response.
Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome pick.
Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body.
LUKE You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
LUKE It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
THREEPIO With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
LUKE You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
THREEPIO That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
LUKE Have you been in many battles?
THREEPIO Several, I think.
THREEPIO Actually, there's not much to tell.
THREEPIO I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.
THREEPIO Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's neck joint.
He uses a larger pick.
LUKE Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.
LUKE Were you on a cruiser or...
The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels.
He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three- dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo.
The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage.
Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
LEIA You're my only hope.
LUKE What's this?
Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate.
Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
THREEPIO What is what?!?
THREEPIO He asked you a question...
THREEPIO What is that?
Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram.
He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate.
Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
LEIA You're my only hope.
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
LEIA You're my only hope.
THREEPIO Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.
THREEPIO Merely a malfunction.
THREEPIO Old data.
THREEPIO Pay it no mind.
Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
LUKE Who is she?
LUKE She's beautiful.
THREEPIO I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
THREEPIO I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.
THREEPIO A person of some importance, sir -- I believe.
THREEPIO Our captain was attached to...
LUKE Is there more to this recording?
Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle.
THREEPIO Behave yourself, Artoo.
THREEPIO You're going to get us in trouble.
THREEPIO It's all right, you can trust him.
THREEPIO He's our new master.
Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
THREEPIO He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.
THREEPIO And it's a private message for him.
THREEPIO Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about.
THREEPIO Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
LUKE Obi-Wan Kenobi?
LUKE I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
THREEPIO I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
LUKE Well, I don't know anyone named Obi- Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.
LUKE He's kind of a strange old hermit.
Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments.
LUKE I wonder who she is.
LUKE It sounds like she's in trouble.
LUKE I'd better play back the whole thing.
Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
THREEPIO He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.
THREEPIO He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.
LUKE H'm?
LUKE Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!
LUKE Okay.
Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoo's side.
LUKE There you go.
The princess immediately disappears...
LUKE Well, wait a minute.
LUKE Where'd she go?
LUKE Bring her back!
LUKE Play back the entire message.
Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in embarrassment.
THREEPIO What message?
THREEPIO The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
A women's voice calls out from another room.
AUNT BERU Luke?
AUNT BERU Luke!
AUNT BERU Come to dinner!
Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot.
LUKE All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
THREEPIO I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room.
LUKE Well, see what you can do with him.
LUKE I'll be right back.
THREEPIO Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
Artoo beeps in response.
THREEPIO No, I don't think he likes you at all.
Artoo beeps.
THREEPIO No, I don't like you either.
Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well- used kitchen.
She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area.
Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red grain.
LUKE You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
OWEN What makes you think that?
LUKE Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.
LUKE He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to control himself.
LUKE I thought he might have meant old Ben.
LUKE Do you know what he's talking about?
LUKE Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.
Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.
OWEN That old man's just a crazy old wizard.
OWEN Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.
OWEN That'll be the end of it.
OWEN It belongs to us now.
LUKE But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
OWEN He won't, I don't think he exists any more.
OWEN He died about the same time as your father.
LUKE He knew my father?
OWEN I told you to forget it.
OWEN Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.
OWEN In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
LUKE Yes, sir.
LUKE I think those new droids are going to work out fine.
LUKE In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.
LUKE And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it.
OWEN You mean the next semester before harvest?
LUKE Sure, there're more than enough droids.
OWEN Harvest is when I need you the most.
OWEN Only one more season.
OWEN This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.
OWEN And then you can go to the Academy next year.
Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.
OWEN You must understand I need you here, Luke.
LUKE But it's a whole 'nother year.
OWEN Look, it's only one more season.
Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.
LUKE Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
AUNT BERU Where are you going?
LUKE It looks like I'm going nowhere.
LUKE I have to finish cleaning those droids.
Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room.
Owen mechanically finishes his dinner.
AUNT BERU Owen, he can't stay here forever.
AUNT BERU Most of his friends have gone.
AUNT BERU It means so much to him.
OWEN I'll make it up to him next year.
OWEN I promise.
AUNT BERU Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
AUNT BERU He has too much of his father in him.
OWEN That's what I'm afraid of.
The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range.
Luke stands watching them for a few moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead.
Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight.
He takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the Jawas were carrying.
He activates the box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.
LUKE What are you doing hiding there?
Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in sight.
THREEPIO It wasn't my fault, sir.
THREEPIO Please don't deactivate me.
THREEPIO I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
LUKE Oh, no!
Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.
Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro- robot.
Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars.
THREEPIO That R2 unit has always been a problem.
THREEPIO These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.
THREEPIO Even I can't understand their logic at times.
LUKE How could I be so stupid?
LUKE He's nowhere in sight.
LUKE Blast it!
THREEPIO Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
LUKE It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around.
LUKE We'll have to wait until morning.
Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.
OWEN Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
LUKE All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.
LUKE Boy, am I gonna get it.
He takes one final look across the dim horizon.
LUKE You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
THREEPIO Oh, he excels at that, sir.
Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard.
The idyll is broken be the yelling of Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.
OWEN Luke?
OWEN Luke?
OWEN Luke?
OWEN Where could he be loafing now!
The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares the morning breakfast.
Owen enters in a huff.
OWEN Have you seen Luke this morning?
AUNT BERU He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.
OWEN Uh?
OWEN Did he take those two new droids with him?
AUNT BERU I think so.
OWEN Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay!
The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland.
DAY
Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something in the motor compartment.
LUKE How's that.
Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.
LUKE Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.
LUKE We must have missed him.
LUKE Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.
THREEPIO Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
LUKE Sure.
LUKE He needs you.
LUKE He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
THREEPIO Deactivate!
THREEPIO Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...
LUKE Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.
LUKE It looks like our droid...
LUKE hit the accelerator.
From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor.
Suddenly in the foreground two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa.
One of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired.
The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument.
The second Tusken Raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.
The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied to a rock.
The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails.
The Tusken Raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff.
The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon.
Luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands before little Artoo.
LUKE Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway.
THREEPIO Master Luke here is your rightful owner.
THREEPIO We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...
THREEPIO and don't talk to me about your mission, either.
THREEPIO You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
LUKE Well, come on.
LUKE It's getting late.
LUKE I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
THREEPIO If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
LUKE No, he's not going to try anything.
Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams.
LUKE What's wrong with him now?
THREEPIO Oh my...
THREEPIO sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.
LUKE Sandpeople!
LUKE Or worst!
LUKE Come on, let's have a look.
LUKE Come on.
Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars.
He spots the two riderless Banthas.
Threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer.
LUKE There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...
LUKE wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right.
LUKE I can see one of them now.
Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his electrobinoculars.
Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view.
Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them.
Threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff.
He can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain.
The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers.
But Luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces.
The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice.
The sinister Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh.
Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder.
The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all directions.
Suddenly they stop.
Then everything is quiet for a few moments.
A great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sandpeople fleeing in terror.
Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and leans over Luke.
His ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard.
Ben Kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy.
Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.
BEN Hello there!
BEN Come here my little friend.
BEN Don't be afraid.
Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern.
Ben puts his hand on Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.
BEN Don't worry, he'll be all right.
LUKE What happened?
BEN Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.
BEN You're fortunate you're still in one piece.
LUKE Ben?
LUKE Ben Kenobi!
LUKE Boy, am I glad to see you!
BEN The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly.
BEN Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?
LUKE Oh, this little droid!
LUKE I think he's searching for his former master...
LUKE I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...
LUKE there seems to be no stopping him.
LUKE He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
LUKE Is he a relative of yours?
LUKE Do you know who he's talking about?
Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.
BEN Obi-Wan Kenobi...
BEN Obi-Wan?
BEN Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...
BEN a long time.
LUKE I think my uncle knew him.
LUKE He said he was dead.
BEN Oh, he's not dead, not...
BEN not yet.
LUKE You know him!
BEN Well of course, of course I know him.
BEN He's me!
BEN I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
LUKE Then the droid does belong to you.
BEN Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.
BEN Very interesting...
He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.
BEN I think we better get indoors.
BEN The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
Luke sits up and rubs his head.
Artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing Luke to remember something.
He looks around.
LUKE Threepio!
Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps.
Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half buried in the sand.
One of his arms has broken off.
Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical man's systems turn on.
THREEPIO Where am I?
THREEPIO I must have taken a bad step...
LUKE Can you stand?
LUKE We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
THREEPIO I don't think I can make it.
THREEPIO You go on, Master Luke.
THREEPIO There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.
THREEPIO I'm done for.
Artoo makes a beeping sound.
LUKE No, you're not.
LUKE What kind of talk is that?
Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet.
Little Artoo watches from the top of the pit.
Ben glances around suspiciously.
Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air.
BEN Quickly, son...
BEN they're on the move.
The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and security.
Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as old Ben sits thinking.
LUKE No, my father didn't fight in the wars.
LUKE He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
BEN That's what your uncle told you.
BEN He didn't hold with your father's ideals.
BEN Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
LUKE You fought in the Clone Wars?
BEN Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
LUKE I wish I'd known him.
BEN He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.
BEN I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.
BEN And he was a good friend.
BEN Which reminds me...
Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.
As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.
Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table.
Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it.
BEN I have something here for you.
BEN Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
BEN He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
THREEPIO Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
LUKE Sure, go ahead.
Ben hands Luke the saber.
LUKE What is it?
BEN Your fathers lightsaber.
BEN This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.
BEN Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
Luke pushes a button on the handle.
A long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there.
The light plays across the ceiling.
BEN An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.
BEN For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.
BEN Before the dark times, before the Empire.
Luke hasn't really been listening.
LUKE How did my father die?
BEN A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.
BEN He betrayed and murdered your father.
BEN Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
BEN Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
LUKE The Force?
BEN Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
BEN It's an energy field created by all living things.
BEN It surrounds us and penetrates us.
BEN It binds the galaxy together.
Artoo makes beeping sounds.
BEN Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.
BEN And where you come from.
LUKE I saw part of the message he was...
Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.
BEN I seem to have found it.
Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before his eyes.
LEIA General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.
LEIA Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.
LEIA I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
LEIA I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.
LEIA My father will know how to retrieve it.
LEIA You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
LEIA This is our most desperate hour.
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.
Old Ben leans back and scratches his head.
He silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe.
Luke has stars in his eyes.
BEN You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
LUKE Alderaan?
LUKE I'm not going to Alderaan.
LUKE I've got to go home.
LUKE It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
BEN I need your help, Luke.
BEN She needs your help.
BEN I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
LUKE I can't get involved!
LUKE I've got work to do!
LUKE It's not that I like the Empire.
LUKE I hate it!
LUKE But there's nothing I can do about it right now.
LUKE It's such a long way from here.
BEN That's your uncle talking.
LUKE Oh, God, my uncle.
LUKE How am I ever going to explain this?
BEN Learn about the Force, Luke.
LUKE Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
LUKE You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
BEN You must do what you feel is right, of course.
An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like battle station: the Death Star!
Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table.
Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room.
Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is speaking.
TAGGE Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.
TAGGE The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
TAGGE They're more dangerous than you realize.
The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.
MOTTI Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!
TAGGE The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as....
Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial outland regions, enters.
He is followed by his powerful ally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader.
All of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table.
The Dark Lord stands behind him.
TARKIN The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
TARKIN I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
TARKIN The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
TAGGE That's impossible!
TAGGE How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
TARKIN The regional governors now have direct control over territories.
TARKIN Fear will keep the local systems in line.
TARKIN Fear of this battle station.
TAGGE And what of the Rebellion?
TAGGE If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
VADER The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
MOTTI Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.
MOTTI This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
MOTTI I suggest we use it!
VADER Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
VADER The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
MOTTI Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
MOTTI Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...
Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's spell.
VADER I find your lack of faith disturbing.
TARKIN Enough of this!
TARKIN Vader, release him!
VADER As you wish.
TARKIN This bickering is pointless.
TARKIN Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.
TARKIN We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas Sandcrawler.
Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies.
LUKE It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right.
LUKE Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.
LUKE It's just...
LUKE I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.
BEN They didn't.
BEN But we are meant to think they did.
BEN These tracks are side by side.
BEN Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.
LUKE These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
BEN And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople.
BEN Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
LUKE Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.
LUKE If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.
LUKE And that would lead them home!
Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the speeder and jumps it.
BEN Wait, Luke!
BEN It's too dangerous.
Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the burning Sandcrawler.
Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.
The speeder roars up to the burning homestead.
Luke jumps out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home.
Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place.
LUKE Uncle Owen!
LUKE Aunt Beru!
LUKE Uncle Owen!
Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle.
Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains.
He is stunned, and cannot speak.
Hate replaces fear and a new resolve comes over him.
Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.
Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow several Imperial guards to enter.
Princess Leia's face is filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.
VADER And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.
The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large hypodermic needle.
The door slides shut and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful.
The muffled screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.
There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the dead.
Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to him.
BEN There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.
BEN You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.
LUKE I want to come with you to Alderaan.
LUKE There's nothing here for me now.
LUKE I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it zooms across the desert.
The speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley.
It is a haphazard array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes.
A harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor.
Luke adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where Ben is standing.
BEN Mos Eisley Spaceport.
BEN You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
BEN We must be cautious.
Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined smile.
The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat- hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots.
A Trooper questions Luke.
TROOPER How long have you had these droids?
LUKE About three or four seasons.
BEN They're for sale if you want them.
TROOPER Let me see your identification.
Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.
BEN You don't need to see his identification.
TROOPER We don't need to see his identification.
BEN These are not the droids your looking for.
TROOPER These are not the droids we're looking for.
BEN He can go about his business.
TROOPER You can go about your business.
BEN Move along.
TROOPER Move along.
TROOPER Move along.
The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport.
Various strange forms of transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are parked outside the bar.
A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle the speeder.
THREEPIO I can't abide these Jawas.
THREEPIO Disgusting creatures.
As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa away.
LUKE Go on, go on.
LUKE I can't understand how we got by those troopers.
LUKE I thought we were dead.
BEN The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.
BEN You will find it a powerful ally.
LUKE Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
BEN Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.
BEN Only watch your step.
BEN This place can be a little rough.
LUKE I'm ready for anything.
THREEPIO Come along, Artoo.
The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina.
The murky, moldy den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar.
At first the sight is horrifying.
One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks.
Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but human scum.
A huge, rough-looking Bartender stops Luke and the robots.
BARTENDER We don't serve their kind here!
Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's drift.
LUKE What?
BARTENDER Your droids.
BARTENDER They'll have to wait outside.
BARTENDER We don't want them here.
Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the Galactic pirates.
He notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.
Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.
LUKE Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.
LUKE We don't want any trouble.
THREEPIO I heartily agree with you sir.
Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.
Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage- looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with fierce baboon-like fangs.
His large blue eyes dominate a fur- covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.
Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, and little else.
He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a sight to behold.
Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh.
Luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between Ben and the giant Wookiee.
Luke is terrified but tries not to show it.
He quietly sips his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever.
A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.
CREATURE Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
The hideous freak is obviously drunk.
Luke tries to ignore the creature and turns back on his drink.
A short, grubby Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the belligerent monstrosity.
HUMAN He doesn't like you.
LUKE I'm sorry.
HUMAN I don't like you either.
The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young adventurer.
HUMAN Don't insult us.
HUMAN You just watch yourself.
HUMAN We're wanted men.
HUMAN I have the death sentence in twelve systems.
LUKE I'll be careful than.
HUMAN You'll be dead.
The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar moves away.
Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy.
His three adversaries ready their weapons.
Old Ben moves in behind Luke.
BEN This little one isn't worth the effort.
BEN Come let me buy you something...
A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid.
With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben.
The bartender panics.
BARTENDER No blasters!
BARTENDER No blaster!
With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor.
The rodent is cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin to groin.
Ben carefully and precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt.
Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, attempts to stand.
The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds.
The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is given a respectable amount of room at the bar.
Luke, rubbing his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe.
Ben points the the Wookiee.
BEN This is Chewbacca.
BEN He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on an electronic conversation with another little red astro- droid.
A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches two stormtroopers in the street.
THREEPIO I don't like the look of this.
Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is sitting.
Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years old.
A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, and cocksure.
HAN Han Solo.
HAN I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.
HAN Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
BEN Yes, indeed.
BEN If it's a fast ship.
HAN Fast ship?
HAN You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
BEN Should I have?
HAN It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation.
HAN I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
HAN I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
HAN She's fast enough for you, old man.
HAN What's the cargo?
BEN Only passengers.
BEN Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
HAN What is it?
HAN Some kind of local trouble?
BEN Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
HAN Well, that's the trick, isn't it?
HAN And it's going to cost you something extra.
HAN Ten thousand in advance.
LUKE Ten thousand?
LUKE We could almost buy our own ship for that!
HAN But who's going to fly it, kid!
HAN You?
LUKE You bet I could.
LUKE I'm not such a bad pilot myself!
LUKE We don't have to sit here and listen...
BEN We haven't that much with us.
BEN But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
HAN Seventeen, huh!
Han ponders this for a few moments.
HAN Okay.
HAN You guys got yourself a ship.
HAN We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
HAN Docking bay Ninety-four.
BEN Ninety-four.
HAN Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some questions.
The bartender points to the booth.
TROOPER All right, we'll check it out.
The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben are gone.
The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.
HAN Seventeen thousand!
HAN Those guys must really be desperate.
HAN This could really save my neck.
HAN Get back to the ship and get her ready.
BEN You'll have to sell your speeder.
LUKE That's okay.
LUKE I'm never coming back to this planet again.
As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side.
The creature speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.
GREEDO Going somewhere, Solo?
HAN Yes, Greedo.
HAN As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.
HAN Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the gun on him.
GREEDO It's too late.
GREEDO You should have paid him when you had the chance.
GREEDO Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.
GREEDO I'm lucky I found you first.
HAN Yeah, but this time I got the money.
GREEDO If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
HAN I don't have it with me.
HAN Tell Jabba...
GREEDO Jabba's through with you.
GREEDO He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
HAN Even I get boarded sometimes.
HAN Do you think I had a choice?
Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.
GREEDO You can tell that to Jabba.
GREEDO He may only take your ship.
HAN Over my dead body.
GREEDO That's the idea.
GREEDO I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
HAN Yes, I'll bet you have.
Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of light.
Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as the other patron look on in bemused amazement.
Han gets up and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some coins as he leaves.
HAN Sorry about the mess.
Several TIE fighters approach the Death Star.
VADER Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.
VADER It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
An Imperial Officer interrupts the meeting.
IMPERIAL OFFICER The final check-out is complete.
IMPERIAL OFFICER All systems are operational.
IMPERIAL OFFICER What course shall we set?
TARKIN Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
VADER What do you mean?
TARKIN I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.
TARKIN Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.
TROOPER With pleasure.
Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking exotic goods in the dingy little stalls.
Men, monsters, and robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and hiding from the hot winds.
THREEPIO Lock the door, Artoo.
One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves on down the alleyway.
The door slides open a crack and Threepio peeks out.
Artoo is barely visible in the background.
TROOPER All right, check that side of the street.
TROOPER It's secure.
TROOPER Move on to the next door.
The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.
THREEPIO I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.
THREEPIO I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.
Artoo makes beeping sounds.
THREEPIO You watch your language!
Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder dealer.
Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.
LUKE He says it's the best he can do.
LUKE Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand.
BEN It will be enough.
Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like creatures.
Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his faithful speeder as he rounds a corner.
A darkly clad creature moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as they disappear down another alley.
BEN If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay.
Jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer.
He is a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth.
JABBA Come on out, Solo!
A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.
HAN I've been waiting for you, Jabba.
JABBA I expected you would be.
HAN I'm not the type to run.
JABBA Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me...
JABBA why haven't you paid me?
JABBA And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that...
JABBA after all we've been through together.
HAN You sent Greedo to blast me.
JABBA Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.
JABBA You're too valuable to fry.
JABBA He was only relaying my concern at your delays.
JABBA He wasn't going to blast you.
HAN I think he thought he was.
HAN Next time don't send one of those twerps.
HAN If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.
JABBA Han, Han!
JABBA If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice...
JABBA you understand I just can't make an exception.
JABBA Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?
JABBA It's not good business.
HAN You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.
HAN I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.
HAN I just need some more time.
JABBA Put your blasters away.
JABBA Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.
JABBA So, for an extra, say twenty percent I'll give you a little more time...
JABBA but this is it.
JABBA If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.
HAN Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.
Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 94.
Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.
Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry.
The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder lot.
He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small transmitter.
Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is Docking Bay 94.
Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that could only loosely be called a starship.
LUKE What a piece of junk.
The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.
HAN She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
HAN She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
HAN I've added some special modifications myself.
Luke scratches his head.
It's obvious he isn't sure about all this.
Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others to follow.
HAN We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han Solo.
Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty engines of the starship.
Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium Falcon passing Solo.
THREEPIO Hello, sir.
Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad creature.
TROOPER Which way?
The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking bay.
TROOPER All right, men.
TROOPER Load your weapons!
The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the docking bay entrance.
TROOPER Stop that ship!
Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing into the docking bay.
Several of the troopers fire at Han as he ducks into the spaceship.
TROOPER Blast 'em!
Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety.
The pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that slams the overhead entry shut.
HAN Chewie, get us out of here!
The group straps in for take off.
THREEPIO Oh, my.
THREEPIO I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the morning sky.
Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.
The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.
Han frantically types information into the ship's computer.
Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.
HAN It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
HAN Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.
HAN Try and hold them off.
HAN Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow planet, Tatooine.
It is followed by two huge Imperial stardestroyers.
Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy spread before them.
Luke and Ben make their way into the cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.
HAN Stay sharp!
HAN There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
LUKE Why don't you outrun them?
LUKE I thought you said this thing was fast.
HAN Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.
HAN We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.
HAN Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
HAN We'll lose them!
Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.
The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.
HAN Here's where the fun begins!
BEN How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
HAN It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.
LUKE Are you kidding?
LUKE At the rate they're gaining...
HAN Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
HAN Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red warning light begins to flash.
LUKE What's that flashing?
HAN We're losing our deflector shield.
HAN Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.
The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if crashing a barrier.
Stars become streaks as the pirateship makes the jump to hyperspace.
The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a second.
Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation.
Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen displaying a small green planet.
MOTTI We've entered the Alderaan system.
Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia.
Her hands are bound.
LEIA Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.
LEIA I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
TARKIN Charming to the last.
TARKIN You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
LEIA I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
TARKIN Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.
TARKIN No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
LEIA The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
TARKIN Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.
TARKIN In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.
TARKIN Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power...
TARKIN on your home planet of Alderaan.
LEIA No!
LEIA Alderaan is peaceful.
LEIA We have no weapons.
LEIA You can't possibly...
TARKIN You would prefer another target?
TARKIN A military target?
TARKIN Then name the system!
Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.
TARKIN I grow tired of asking this.
TARKIN So it'll be the last time.
TARKIN Where is the Rebel base?
Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to Alderaan.
LEIA Dantooine.
Leia lowers her head.
LEIA They're on Dantooine.
TARKIN There.
TARKIN You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable.
TARKIN Continue with the operation.
TARKIN You may fire when ready.
LEIA What?
TARKIN You're far too trusting.
TARKIN Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.
TARKIN But don't worry.
TARKIN We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.
LEIA No!
VADER Commence primary ignition.
A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights.
A hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.
Another lever is pulled.
Vader reaches for still another lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up.
A huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan.
The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.
Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker" robot.
Ben suddenly turns away and sits down.
He falters, seems almost faint.
LUKE Are you all right?
LUKE What's wrong?
BEN I felt a great disturbance in the Force...
BEN as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
BEN I fear something terrible has happened.
Ben rubs his forehead.
He seems to drift into a trance.
Then he fixes his gaze on Luke.
BEN You'd better get on with your exercises.
Han Solo enters the room.
HAN Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
HAN I told you I'd outrun 'em.
Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.
HAN Don't everyone thank me at once.
Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along a chess-type board.
HAN Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters.
Each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it.
Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- covered arms over his head.
THREEPIO Now be careful, Artoo.
Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square.
A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot.
Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.
THREEPIO He made a fair move.
THREEPIO Screaming about it won't help you.
HAN Let him have it.
HAN It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
THREEPIO But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
HAN That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.
HAN Wookiees are known to do that.
THREEPIO I see your point, sir.
THREEPIO I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.
THREEPIO Let the Wookiee win.
Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place.
A humming lightsaber is held high over his head.
Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.
Han watches with a bit of smugness.
BEN Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
LUKE You mean it controls your actions?
BEN Partially.
BEN But it also obeys your commands.
Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc.
The ball floats to one side of the youth then the other.
Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face.
Luke doesn't move and the ball backs off.
It slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks.
It hits Luke in the leg causing him to tumble over.
Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.
HAN Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
LUKE You don't believe in the Force, do you?
HAN Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
HAN I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
HAN There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
Ben smiles quietly.
HAN It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
BEN I suggest you try it again, Luke.
Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his eyes.
BEN This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
LUKE With the blast shield down, I can't even see.
LUKE How am I supposed to fight?
BEN Your eyes can deceive you.
BEN Don't trust them.
Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker into the air.
The ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock.
Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants.
He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker.
BEN Stretch out with your feelings.
Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen.
The seeker makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt.
The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position.
BEN You see, you can do it.
HAN I call it luck.
BEN In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
HAN Look, going good against remotes is one thing.
HAN Going good against the living?
HAN That's something else.
Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel.
HAN Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.
LUKE You know, I did feel something.
LUKE I could almost see the remote.
BEN That's good.
BEN You have taken your first step into a larger world.
Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the evil Dark Lord Darth Vader.
TARKIN Yes.
OFFICER CASS Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.
OFFICER CASS They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.
OFFICER CASS They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
TARKIN She lied!
TARKIN She lied to us!
VADER I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
TARKIN Terminate her...
TARKIN immediately!
The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship.
HAN Stand by, Chewie, here we go.
HAN Cut in the sublight engines.
Han pulls back on a control lever.
Outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then stop.
Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about.
Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship.
HAN What the...?
HAN Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
HAN Some kind of asteroid collision.
HAN It's not on any of the charts.
The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the emergency.
Luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit.
LUKE What's going on?
HAN Our position is correct, except...
HAN no, Alderaan!
LUKE What do you mean?
LUKE Where is it?
HAN Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
HAN It ain't there.
HAN It's been totally blown away.
LUKE What?
LUKE How?
Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to settle down.
BEN Destroyed...
BEN by the Empire!
HAN The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.
HAN It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming.
HAN There's another ship coming in.
LUKE Maybe they know what happened.
BEN It's an Imperial fighter.
Chewbacca barks his concern.
A huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently.
A tiny, finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.
LUKE It followed us!
BEN No.
BEN It's a short range fighter.
HAN There aren't any bases around here.
HAN Where did it come from?
The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship.
LUKE It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
LUKE If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
HAN Not if I can help it.
HAN Chewie...jam it's transmissions.
BEN It'd be as well to let it go.
BEN It's too far out of range.
HAN Not for long...
The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.
The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter.
In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it.
Ben stands behind Chewbacca.
BEN A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
LUKE It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
HAN Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.
The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head.
The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet.
LUKE Look at him.
LUKE He's headed for that small moon.
HAN I think I can get him before he gets there...
HAN he's almost in range.
The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station.
BEN That's no moon!
BEN It's a space station.
HAN It's too big to be a space station.
LUKE I have a very bad feeling about this.
HAN Yeah, I think your right.
HAN Full reverse!
HAN Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station.
LUKE Why are we still moving towards it?
HAN We're caught in a tractor beam!
HAN It's pulling us in!
LUKE But there's gotta be something you can do!
HAN There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.
HAN I'm in full power.
HAN I'm going to have to shut down.
HAN But they're not going to get me without a fight!
Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.
BEN You can't win.
BEN But there are alternatives to fighting.
As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station becomes staggering.
Running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged.
The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port control room and huge laser turret cannons.
Clear Bay twenty-three-seven.
We are opening the magnetic field.
The pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar.
Thirty stormtroopers stand at attention in a central assembly area.
OFFICER To you stations!
OFFICER Come with me.
Stormtroopers run to their posts.
A line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons ready to fire.
OFFICER Close all outboard shields!
OFFICER Close all outboard shields!
Tarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz.
TARKIN Yes.
VOICE We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.
VOICE It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
VADER They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.
VADER She may yet be of some use to us.
Vader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.
VOICE Unlock one-five-seven and nine.
VOICE Release charges.
OFFICER There's no one on board, sir.
OFFICER According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.
OFFICER It must be a decoy, sir.
OFFICER Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
VADER Did you find any droids?
OFFICER No, sir.
OFFICER If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
VADER Send a scanning crew on board.
VADER I want every part of this ship checked.
OFFICER Yes, sir.
VADER I sense something...
VADER a presence I haven't felt since...
Vader turns quickly and exits the hangar.
OFFICER Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.
OFFICER I want every part of this ship checked!
A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit.
In a few moments all is quiet.
The muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade.
Two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke.
Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker.
LUKE Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
HAN I use them for smuggling.
HAN I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.
HAN This is ridiculous.
HAN Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
BEN Leave that to me!
HAN Damn fool.
HAN I knew that you were going to say that!
BEN Who's the more foolish...
BEN the fool or the fool who follows him?
Han shakes his head, muttering to himself.
Chewbacca agrees.
The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.
TROOPER The ship's all yours.
TROOPER If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.
TROOPER All right, let's go.
The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.
HAN'S VOICE Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?
The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is heard.
In a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing.
He speaks into the comlink.
GANTRY OFFICER TX-four-one-two.
GANTRY OFFICER Why aren't you at your post?
GANTRY OFFICER TX-four-one-two, do you copy?
A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working.
The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look.
GANTRY OFFICER Take over.
GANTRY OFFICER We've got a bad transmitter.
GANTRY OFFICER I'll see what I can do.
As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering Chewbacca.
The gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward.
With a bone- chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow.
The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper.
Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper.
Luke quickly removes his helmet.
LUKE You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
HAN Bring them on!
HAN I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
THREEPIO We found the computer outlet, sir.
Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor.
He begins to inspect it carefully.
Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.
Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.
BEN Plug in.
BEN He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot.
After a few moments, he beeps something.
THREEPIO He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here.
THREEPIO He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
The computer monitor flashes readouts.
THREEPIO The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.
THREEPIO A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.
BEN I don't think you boys can help.
BEN I must go alone.
HAN Whatever you say.
HAN I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already.
LUKE I want to go with you.
BEN Be patient, Luke.
BEN Stay and watch over the droids.
LUKE But he can...
BEN They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
BEN Your destiny lies along a different path than mine.
BEN The Force will be with you...
BEN always!
Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey hallway.
Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head in agreement.
HAN Boy you said it, Chewie.
Han looks at Luke.
HAN Where did you dig up that old fossil?
LUKE Ben is a great man.
HAN Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
LUKE I didn't hear you give any ideas...
HAN Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...
LUKE Who do you think...
Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.
Luke goes over to him.
LUKE What is it?
THREEPIO I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
THREEPIO He says "I found her", and keeps repeating, "She's here."
LUKE Well, who...
LUKE who has he found?
Artoo whistles a frantic reply.
THREEPIO Princess Leia.
LUKE The princess?
LUKE She's here?
HAN Princess?
HAN What's going on?
THREEPIO Level five.
THREEPIO Detention block A A-twenty- three.
THREEPIO I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
LUKE Oh, no!
LUKE We've got to do something.
HAN What are you talking about?
LUKE The droid belongs to her.
LUKE She's the one in the message...
LUKE We've got to help her.
HAN Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
HAN The old man wants us to wait right here.
LUKE But he didn't know she was here.
LUKE Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
HAN I'm not going anywhere.
LUKE They're going to execute her.
LUKE Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.
LUKE Now all you want to do is stay.
HAN Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
LUKE But they're going to kill her!
HAN Better her than me...
LUKE She's rich.
Chewbacca growls.
HAN Rich?
LUKE Yes.
LUKE Rich, powerful!
LUKE Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
HAN What?
LUKE Well more wealth that you can imagine.
HAN I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
LUKE You'll get it!
HAN I better!
LUKE You will...
HAN All right, kid.
HAN But you'd better be right about this.
Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.
LUKE All right.
HAN What's your plan?
LUKE Uh...
LUKE Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?
Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.
LUKE Okay.
LUKE Now, I'm going to put these on you.
Chewie lets out a hideous growl.
LUKE Okay.
LUKE Han, you put these on.
Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.
HAN Don't worry, Chewie.
HAN I think I know what he has in mind.
The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.
THREEPIO Master Luke, sir!
THREEPIO Pardon me for asking...
THREEPIO but, ah...
THREEPIO what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
LUKE Lock the door!
HAN And hope they don't have blasters.
THREEPIO That isn't very reassuring.
Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.
Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive.
Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely.
Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious glance.
Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.
LUKE I can't see a thing in this helmet.
A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by Han.
The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.
Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway.
They pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio but with an insect face.
At the far end of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then disappears down a small hallway.
His appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion.
No one in the hallway seems to notice him.
Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides open behind them.
The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old grey security station.
Guards and laser gates are everywhere.
Han whispers to Luke under his breath.
HAN This is not going to work.
LUKE Why didn't you say so before?
HAN I did say so before!
Elevator doors open.
A tall, grim looking Officer approaches the trio.
OFFICER Where are you taking this...
OFFICER thing?
Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut up.
LUKE Prisoner transfer from Block one-one- three-eight.
OFFICER I wasn't notified.
OFFICER I'll have to clear it.
The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information.
There are only three other troopers in the area.
Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes.
Han unfastens one of Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.
Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear-piercing howls.
He grabs Han's laser rifle.
HAN Look out!
HAN He's loose!
LUKE He's going to pull us all apart.
HAN Go get him!
The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded.
Luke and Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee.
Their barrage of laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the Imperial guards.
The officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system.
Han rushes to the comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going on.
He quickly checks the computer readout.
HAN We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
HAN Here it is...
HAN cell twenty-one-eight-seven.
HAN You go get her.
HAN I'll hold them here.
Luke races down one of the cell corridors.
Han speaks into the buzzing comlink.
HAN Everything is under control.
HAN Situation normal.
INTERCOM VOICE What happened?
HAN Uh...
HAN had a slight weapons malfunction.
HAN But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.
HAN We're fine.
HAN We're all fine here, now, thank you.
HAN How are you?
INTERCOM VOICE We're sending a squad up.
HAN Uh, uh, negative.
HAN We had a reactor leak here now.
HAN Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
HAN Large leak...
HAN very dangerous.
INTERCOM VOICE Who is this?
INTERCOM VOICE What's your operating number?
Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.
HAN Boring conversation anyway.
HAN Luke!
HAN We're going to have company!
Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door away with a laser pistol.
When the smoke clears, Luke sees the dazzling young princess-senator.
She had been sleeping and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face.
Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at her with his mouth hanging open.
LEIA Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?
Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.
LUKE What?
LUKE Oh...
LUKE the uniform.
LUKE I'm Luke Skywalker.
LUKE I'm here to rescue you.
LEIA You're who?
LUKE I'm here to rescue you.
LUKE I've got your R2 unit.
LUKE I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
LEIA Ben Kenobi is here!
LEIA Where is he?
LUKE Come on!
Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the far end of the conference table.
VADER He is here...
TARKIN Obi-Wan Kenobi!
TARKIN What makes you think so?
VADER A tremor in the Force.
VADER The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
TARKIN Surely he must be dead by now.
VADER Don't underestimate the power of the Force.
TARKIN The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.
TARKIN You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.
TARKIN Yes.
INTERCOM VOICE Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty- three.
TARKIN The princess!
TARKIN Put all sections on alert!
VADER Obi-Wan is here.
VADER The Force is with him.
TARKIN If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
VADER Escape is not his plan.
VADER I must face him alone.
An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the elevator door.
HAN Chewie!
Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.
HAN Get behind me!
HAN Get behind me!
A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.
Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke and flame.
They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.
HAN Can't get out that way.
LEIA Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
HAN Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their way down the corridor.
LUKE See-Threepio!
LUKE See-Threepio!
THREEPIO Yes sir?
LUKE We've been cut off!
LUKE Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...
LUKE What was that?
LUKE I didn't copy!
Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and whistles a blue streak.
Threepio yells into the small comlink transmitter.
THREEPIO I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.
THREEPIO The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted.
Someone begins banging on the door.
TROOPER VOICE Open up in there!
THREEPIO Oh, no!
Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops.
Han and Chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway.
The laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor.
LUKE There isn't any other way out.
HAN I can't hold them off forever!
HAN Now what?
LEIA This is some rescue.
LEIA When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
HAN He's the brains, sweetheart.
Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.
LUKE Well, I didn't...
The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in the wall next to Han, almost frying him.
HAN What the hell are you doing?
LEIA Somebody has to save our skins.
LEIA Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca look on in amazement.
Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something.
HAN Get in there you big furry oaf!
HAN I don't care what you smell!
HAN Get in there and don't worry about it.
Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the tiny opening.
Luke and Han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening.
HAN Wonderful girl!
HAN Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
HAN Get in there!
Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness.
Han fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then slides into the chute himself and is gone.
Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.
Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit.
He finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open.
It won't budge.
HAN Oh!
HAN The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.
HAN What an incredible smell you've discovered!
HAN Let's get out of here!
HAN Get away from there...
LUKE No!
LUKE wait!
Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch.
The laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.
Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them.
Leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face.
LUKE Will you forget it?
LUKE I already tried it.
LUKE It's magnetically sealed!
LEIA Put that thing away!
LEIA You're going to get us all killed.
HAN Absolutely, Your Worship.
HAN Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.
HAN You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
LEIA It could be worse...
A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths.
Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away.
Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn.
The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.
HAN It's worse.
LUKE There's something alive in here!
HAN That's your imagination.
LUKE Something just moves past my leg!
LUKE Look!
LUKE Did you see that?
HAN What?
LUKE Help!
Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.
HAN Luke!
HAN Luke!
HAN Luke!
Solo tries to get to Luke.
Luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs.
A membrane tentacle is wrapped around his throat.
LEIA Luke!
Leia extends a long pipe toward him.
LEIA Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
LUKE Blast it, will you!
LUKE My gun's jammed.
HAN Where?
LUKE Anywhere!
LUKE Oh!!
Solo fires his gun downward.
Luke is pulled back into the muck by the slimy tentacle.
HAN Luke!
HAN Luke!
Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches.
Then everything is deathly quiet.
Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls in the corner.
With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly bobs to the surface.
LEIA Grab him!
Luke seems to be released by the thing.
LEIA What happened?
LUKE I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
HAN I've got a very bad feeling about this.
Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge toward the Rebels.
LUKE The walls are moving!
LEIA Don't just stand there.
LEIA Try to brace it with something.
They place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher rumbles on.
The situation doesn't look too good.
LUKE Wait a minute!
Luke pulls out his comlink.
LUKE Threepio!
LUKE Come in Threepio!
LUKE Threepio!
LUKE Where could he be?
A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which is sitting on the deserted computer console.
Artoo and Threepio are nowhere in sight.
Suddenly there is a great explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the floor.
Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.
FIRST TROOPER Take over!
FIRST TROOPER See to him!
FIRST TROOPER Look there!
A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides open.
See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside.
Artoo follows his bronze companion out into the office.
THREEPIO They're madmen!
THREEPIO They're heading for the prison level.
THREEPIO If you hurry, you might catch them.
FIRST OFFICER Follow me!
FIRST OFFICER You stand guard.
The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to watch over the command office.
THREEPIO Come on!
The guard aims a blaster at them.
THREEPIO Oh!
THREEPIO All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.
THREEPIO If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
TROOPER All right.
The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries out the door.
As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.
Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws.
Han is leaning back against the other wall.
Garbage is snapping and popping.
Luke is trying to reach Threepio.
LUKE Threepio!
LUKE Come in, Threepio!
LUKE Threepio!
Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole.
Leia begins to sink into the trash.
HAN Get to the top!
LEIA I can't
LUKE Where could he be?
LUKE Threepio!
LUKE Threepio, will you come in?
THREEPIO They aren't here!
THREEPIO Something must have happened to them.
THREEPIO See if they've been captured.
Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from the tiny robot.
THREEPIO Hurry!
The walls are only feet apart.
Leia and Han are braced against the walls.
The princess is frightened.
They look at each other.
Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds it tightly.
She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the first crushing pressure against her body.
HAN One thing's for sure.
HAN We're all going to be a lot thinner!
HAN Get on top of it!
LEIA I'm trying!
THREEPIO Thank goodness, they haven't found them!
THREEPIO Where could they be?
Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.
THREEPIO Use the comlink?
THREEPIO Oh, my!
THREEPIO I forgot I turned it off!
Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his head above the rising ooze.
Luke's comlink begins to buzz and he rips it off his belt.
Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, but not distinctly.
THREEPIO Are you there, sir?
LUKE Threepio!
THREEPIO We've had some problems...
LUKE Will you shut up and listen to me?
LUKE Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you?
LUKE Do you copy?
LUKE Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
LUKE Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
THREEPIO No.
THREEPIO Shut them all down!
THREEPIO Hurry!
Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.
THREEPIO Listen to them!
THREEPIO They're dying, Artoo!
THREEPIO Curse my metal body!
THREEPIO I wasn't fast enough.
THREEPIO It's all my fault!
THREEPIO My poor master!
LUKE Threepio, we're all right!
The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief.
The walls have stopped moving.
Han, Chewie and Leia embrace in the background.
LUKE We're all right.
LUKE You did great.
Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a number.
LUKE Hey...
LUKE hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number...
LUKE where are we?
HAN Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.
Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge tractor beam.
The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep.
The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard.
The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading to a control panel that connects two large cables.
He carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, and several lights on the board go from red to blue.
The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.
Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster belts.
HAN If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.
Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster from Solo.
LUKE Well, let's get moving!
Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage room, as he runs away and then stops howling.
HAN Where are you going?
The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a victim.
Han aims his pistol.
LEIA No, wait.
LEIA They'll hear!
Han fires at the doorway.
The noise of the blast echoes relentlessly throughout the empty passageway.
Luke simply shakes his head in disgust.
HAN Come here, you big coward!
Chewie shakes his head "no."
HAN Chewie!
HAN Come here!
LEIA Listen.
LEIA I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.
LEIA Okay?
Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.
HAN Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!
HAN I take orders from one person!
HAN Me!
LEIA It's a wonder you're still alive.
LEIA Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
Han watches her start away.
He looks at Luke.
HAN No reward is worth this.
They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.
Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of stormtroopers marches to the power trench.
Ben instantly slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few feet of him.
OFFICER Secure this area until the alert is canceled.
FIRST TROOPER Give me regular reports.
All but two of the stormtroopers leave.
FIRST TROOPER Do you know what's going on?
SECOND TROOPER Maybe it's another drill.
Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers as they turn their backs to him.
Ben gestures with his hand toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the other hallway.
With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips past the troopers and into the main hallway.
SECOND TROOPER What was that?
FIRST TROOPER Oh, it's nothing.
FIRST TROOPER Don't worry about it.
Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship.
Troopers are milling about the ship.
Luke takes out his pocket comlink.
HAN There she is.
LUKE See-Threepio, do you copy?
THREEPIO For the moment.
THREEPIO Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
LUKE We're right above you.
LUKE Stand by.
Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of the pirateship.
Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and points out the window to the ship.
LEIA You came in that thing?
LEIA You're braver that I thought.
HAN Nice!
HAN Come on!
Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the hallway.
They round a corner and run right into twenty Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them.
Both groups are taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.
FIRST TROOPER It's them!
FIRST TROOPER Blast them!
Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges the troops, firing.
His blaster knocks one of the stormtroopers into the air.
Chewie follows his captain down the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.
HAN Get back to the ship!
LUKE Where are you going?
LUKE Come back!
Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.
LEIA He certainly has courage.
LUKE What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?
LUKE Come on!
Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck.
Luke and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.
Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway.
He is yelling and brandishing his laser pistol.
The troops reach a dead end and are forced to turn and fight.
Han stops a few feet from them and assumes a defensive position.
The troops begin to raise their laser guns.
Soon all ten troopers are moving into an attack position in front of the lone starpirate.
Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops begin to advance.
Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.
Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt to save his bold captain.
Suddenly he hears the firing of laser guns and yelling.
Around the corner shoots Han, pirate extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of furious stormtroopers.
Chewbacca turns and starts running the other way also.
Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers.
They quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an open hatchway.
Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity.
The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and Luke almost rushes into the abyss.
He loses his balance off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of his arm and pulls him back.
LUKE I think we took a wrong turn.
Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby reminding them of the oncoming danger.
Luke fires back at the advancing troops.
Leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.
Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.
LEIA There's no lock!
Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.
LUKE That oughta hold it for a while.
LEIA Quick, we've got to get across.
LEIA Find the control that extends the bridge.
LUKE Oh, I think I just blasted it.
Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and pounding sounds.
LEIA They're coming through!
Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when laserfire hits the wall behind him.
Luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them.
They exchange fire.
Two more troops appear on another overhang, also firing.
A trooper is hit, and grabs at his chest.
Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft.
Troopers move back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.
LUKE Here, hold this.
Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt.
It has a grappler hook on it.
A trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia.
As Luke works with the rope, Leia returns the laser volley.
Another trooper appears and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.
Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of more troops.
LEIA Here they come!
Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and he falls into the abyss.
Luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes.
He tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in his arms.
Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him quickly on the lips.
Luke is very surprised.
LEIA For luck!
Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side.
Just as Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo.
Luke returns the fire before ducking into the tiny subhallway.
Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway.
He checks to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the opposite direction.
Darth Vader appears at the far end of the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.
Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the pirateship entry ramp.
THREEPIO Where could they be?
Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left and right, beeping a response.
Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several troopers hot on their trail.
TROOPER Close the blast doors!
At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in front of them.
The young starpilot and his furry companion race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops before the doors slam shut.
TROOPER Open the blast doors!
TROOPER Open the blast doors!
Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar where the pirateship waits.
Just before he reaches the hangar, Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten feet away.
Vader lights his saber.
Ben also ignites his and steps slowly forward.
VADER I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
VADER We meet again, at last.
VADER The circle is now complete.
Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive position.
The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.
VADER When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.
BEN Only a master of evil, Darth.
The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right moment.
Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him.
He shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.
Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked by a lightning movement of The Sith.
A masterful slash stroke by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi.
Another of the Jedi's blows is blocked, then countered.
Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar.
The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound.
VADER Your powers are weak, old man.
BEN You can't win, Darth.
BEN If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.
Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.
HAN Didn't we just leave this party?
Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.
HAN What kept you?
LEIA We ran into some old friends.
LUKE Is the ship all right?
HAN Seems okay, if we can get to it.
HAN Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel.
As they hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact.
Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord of The Sith fight.
Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his group's vantage point.
LUKE Look!
Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking bay.
Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's Imperial docking bay.
THREEPIO Come on, Artoo, we're going!
Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards Ben and The Sith Knight.
He pulls on Artoo.
Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel.
The troops rush toward the battling knights.
HAN Now's our chance!
HAN Go!
They start for the Millennium Falcon.
Ben sees the troops charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped.
Vader takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings his mighty lightsaber down on the old man.
Ben manages to deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.
The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene look on his face.
Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half.
Ben's cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.
Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the empty cloak.
As the guards are distracted, the adventurers and the robots reach the starship.
Luke sees Ben cut in two and starts for him.
Aghast, he yells out.
LUKE No!
The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.
The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns their fire.
Solo joins in the laserfire.
Vader looks up and advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.
HAN Come on!
LEIA Come on!
LEIA Luke, its too late!
HAN Blast the door!
HAN Kid!
Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it explodes.
The door begins to slide shut.
Three troopers charge forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the docking bay.
A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his onrushing compatriots.
Luke starts for the advancing troops, as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship.
He fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.
BEN'S VOICE Run, Luke!
BEN'S VOICE Run!
Luke looks around to see where the voice came from.
He turns toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the troopers and races into the ship.
Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move.
The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.
HAN I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.
HAN Okay, hit it!
Chewbacca growls in agreement.
The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness of space.
Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off blankly as the robots look on.
Leia puts a blanket around him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her.
She sits down beside him.
Solo spots approaching enemy ships.
HAN We're coming up on the sentry ships.
HAN Hold 'em off!
HAN Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!
Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.
LUKE I can't believe he's gone.
Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.
LEIA There wasn't anything you could have done.
Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the princess.
HAN Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!
Solo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport.
Luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads for the cockpit.
Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large rotating turrets on either side of the ship.
Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone.
HAN You in, kid?
HAN Okay, stay sharp!
Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking TIE fighters.
The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls as the ship bounces slightly.
Computer graphic readouts form on Solo's target screen, as Han reaches for controls.
Luke sits in readiness for the attack, his hand on the laser cannon's control button.
Chewbacca spots the enemy ships and barks.
LEIA Here they come!
The Imperial TIE fighters move towards the Millennium Falcon, one each veering off to the left and right of the pirateship.
The stars whip past behind the Imperial pilot as he adjusts his maneuvering joy stick.
The TIE fighter races past the Falcon, firing laser beams as it passes.
Threepio is seated in the hold area, next to Artoo-Detoo.
The pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in the room and then comes back on.
A TIE fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and fires at it with the laser cannon.
Luke does likewise, as the fighter streaks into view.
The ship has suffered a minor hit, and bounces slightly.
Two TIE fighters dive down toward the pirateship.
Luke fires at an unseen fighter.
LUKE They're coming in too fast!
Pan with pirateship as two TIE fighters charge through the background.
Laserbolts streak from all the craft.
The ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the cockpit.
The Wookiee chatters something to Leia.
Full shot of a TIE fighter as it moves fast through the frame, firing on the pirate starship.
The two TIE fighters fire a barrage of laserbeams at the pirateship.
A laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship.
The ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet fill of small computer chips.
THREEPIO Oooh!
Leia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates the ship's controls.
LEIA We've lost lateral controls.
HAN Don't worry, she'll hold together.
An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel, causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.
HAN You hear me, baby?
HAN Hold together!
Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant beeping all the while.
Luke swivels in his gun mount, following the TIE fighter with his laser cannon.
Solo aims his laser cannon at the enemy fighter.
A TIE fighter streaks in front of the starship.
Leia watches the TIE fighter ship fly over.
A TIE fighter heads right for the pirateship, then zooms overhead.
Luke follows the TIE fighter across his field of view, firing laserbeams from his cannon.
A TIE fighter dives past the pirateship.
Luke fires at a TIE fighter.
At his port, Han follows a fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire.
He connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust.
Han laughs victoriously.
Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon, unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship.
Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke, smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular direct hit.
LUKE Got him!
LUKE I got him!
Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully returns.
HAN Great kid!
HAN Don't get cocky.
Han turns back to his laser cannon.
Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship.
While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking over her shoulder out the ports.
LEIA There are still two more of them out there!
A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts at it.
Luke and Han look into their respective projected target screens.
An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser cannon.
Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his face.
The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing destructive blasts at it.
Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, and it bursts into a spectacular explosion.
Luke's projected screen gives a readout of the hit.
The pirateship bounces slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire.
The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in, firing upon the Falcon.
Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc of the TIE fighter.
The fighter comes closer, firing at the pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower of burning fragments.
LUKE That's it!
LUKE We did it!
The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.
LEIA We did it!
Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled in the smoking, sparking wires.
THREEPIO Help!
THREEPIO I think I'm melting!
THREEPIO This is all your fault.
Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response.
The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically through space.
Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is watching the huge view screen.
A sea of stars is before him.
TARKIN Are they away?
VADER They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
TARKIN You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?
TARKIN I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
TARKIN This had better work.
Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of the ship.
Chewie moves into the aft section to check the damage.
Leia is seated near Han.
HAN Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
HAN You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
LEIA That doesn't sound too hard.
LEIA Besides, they let us go.
LEIA It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
HAN Easy...
HAN you call that easy?
LEIA Their tracking us!
HAN Not this ship, sister.
Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.
LEIA At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
HAN What's so important?
HAN What's he carrying?
LEIA The technical readouts of that battle station.
LEIA I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.
LEIA It's not over yet!
HAN It is for me, sister!
HAN Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
HAN I expect to be well paid.
HAN I'm in it for the money!
LEIA You needn't worry about your reward.
LEIA If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!
She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, passes Luke coming in.
LEIA Your friend is quite a mercenary.
LEIA I wonder if he really cares about anything...
LEIA or anyone.
LUKE I care!
Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat.
He and Han stare out at the vast blackness of space.
LUKE So...
LUKE what do you think of her, Han?
HAN I'm trying not to, kid!
LUKE Good...
HAN Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
HAN I don't know, what do you think?
HAN Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
LUKE No!
Luke says it with finality and looks away.
Han smiles at young Luke's jealousy.
The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.
The pirateship soars over the dense jungle.
An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside.
He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely visible in the foliage.
Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple lies shrouded in an eerie mist.
The air is heavy with the fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures.
Han, Luke and the others are greeted by the Rebel troops.
Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored military speeder.
The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set up in the interior of the crumbling temple.
Willard, the commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and gives Leia a big hug.
Every one is pleased to see her.
WILLARD You're safe!
WILLARD We had feared the worst.
Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.
WILLARD When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were...
WILLARD lost along with your father.
LEIA We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander.
LEIA The battle station has surely tracked us here.
LEIA It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
LEIA You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.
LEIA It is our only hope.
The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red planet Yavin.
Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their discussion by the buzz of the comlink.
Tarkin moves to answer the call.
TARKIN Yes.
We are approaching the planet Yavin.
The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.
We are preparing to orbit the planet.
A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, surveying the countryside.
A mist hangs over the jungle of twisted green.
Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display.
Leia and several other senators are to one side of the giant readout.
The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots.
Everyone is listening intently to what Dodonna is saying.
Han and Chewbacca are standing near the back.
DODONNA The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.
DODONNA It's defenses are designed around a direct large- scale assault.
DODONNA A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands and addresses Dodonna.
GOLD LEADER Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
DODONNA Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.
DODONNA An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping sounds, and turns his head from right to left.
DODONNA The approach will not be easy.
DODONNA You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.
DODONNA The target area is only two meters wide.
DODONNA It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.
DODONNA The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.
DODONNA A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.
DODONNA Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.
DODONNA The shaft is ray- shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about sixteen years old.
WEDGE That's impossible, even for a computer.
LUKE It's not impossible.
LUKE I used to bull's- eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.
LUKE They're not much bigger than two meters.
DODONNA Man your ships!
DODONNA And may the Force be with you!
The group rises and begins to leave.
The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the tiny green moon.
Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and the forth moon.
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.
The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.
VADER This will be a day long remembered.
VADER It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.
Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and unlocking power couplings.
In an area isolated from this activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes onto an armored speeder.
MAN'S VOICE All flight trooper, man your stations.
MAN'S VOICE All flight troops, man your stations.
Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter pilots' preparation.
Luke is quite saddened at the sight of his friend's departure.
LUKE So...
LUKE you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
HAN That's right, yeah!
HAN I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.
HAN Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?
HAN Why don't you come with us?
HAN You're pretty good in a fight.
HAN I could use you.
LUKE Come on!
LUKE Why don't you take a look around?
LUKE You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.
LUKE They could use a good pilot like you.
LUKE You're turning your back on them.
HAN What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
HAN Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.
HAN It's more like suicide.
LUKE All right.
LUKE Well, take care of yourself, Han.
LUKE I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.
HAN Hey, Luke...
HAN may the Force be with you!
Luke turns and sees Han wink at him.
Luke lifts his hand in a small wave and then goes off.
Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,
HAN What're you lookin' at?
HAN I know what I'm doing.
Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.
LEIA What's wrong?
LUKE Oh, it's Han!
LUKE I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
LEIA He's got to follow his own path.
LEIA No one can choose it for him.
LUKE I only wish Ben were here.
Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off.
As Luke heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs his arm.
BIGGS Luke!
BIGGS I don't believe it!
BIGGS How'd you get here...
BIGGS are you going out with us?!
LUKE Biggs!
LUKE Of course, I'll be up there with you!
LUKE Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up behind Luke and Biggs.
He has the confident smile of a born leader.
RED LEADER Are you...
RED LEADER Luke Skywalker?
RED LEADER Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty- five?
BIGGS Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his fighter.
RED LEADER I met your father once when I was just a boy, he was a great pilot.
RED LEADER You'll do all right.
RED LEADER If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.
LUKE Thank you, sir.
LUKE I'll try.
Red Leader hurries to his own ship.
BIGGS I've got to get aboard.
BIGGS Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back.
BIGGS All right?
LUKE I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
BIGGS You did, all right.
BIGGS It's going to be like old times, Luke.
BIGGS We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!
Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement.
He heads for his ship.
As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the back of the fighter.
CHIEF This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.
CHIEF Do you want a new one?
LUKE Not on your life!
LUKE That little droid and I have been through a lot together.
LUKE You okay, Artoo?
The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft.
Now a part of the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps that he is fine.
Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an his helmet.
Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner into Luke's X-wing.
It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo beeps good-bye.
CHIEF Okay, easy she goes!
THREEPIO Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back.
Artoo beeps in agreement.
THREEPIO You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
Artoo whistles his reply.
All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.
The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments.
The hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands.
Coupling hoses are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled.
Cockpit shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot.
A signalman, holding red guiding lights, directs the ships.
Luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.
BEN'S VOICE Luke, the Force will be with you.
Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.
All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle.
The muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud cover.
The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its four moons.
The red dot that represents the Death Star moves ever closer to the system.
A series of green dots appear around the fourth moon.
A din of indistinct chatter fills the war room.
MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE Stand-by alert.
MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE Death Star approaching.
MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes.
The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.
Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow around a huge planet, Yavin.
Rebel fighters flying in formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly pull away.
Red Leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights, looking to each side at his wing men.
RED LEADER All wings report in.
One of the Rebel fighters checks in through his mike.
RED TEN Red Ten standing by.
Biggs checks his fighter's controls, alert and ready for combat.
RED SEVEN Red Seven standing by.
BIGGS Red Three standing by.
PORKINS Red Six standing by.
RED NINE Red Nine standing by.
WEDGE Red Two standing by.
RED ELEVEN Red Eleven standing by.
LUKE Red Five standing by.
Artoo-Detoo, in position outside of the fighter, turns his head from side to side and makes beeping sounds.
RED LEADER Lock S-foils in attack position.
The group of X-wing fighters move in formation toward the Death Star, unfolding the wings and locking them in the "X" position.
READ LEADER We're passing through their magnetic field.
RED LEADER Hold tight!
Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the approaching Death Star.
The ship begins to be buffeted slightly.
RED LEADER Switch your deflectors on.
RED LEADER Double front!
The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation.
The Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in size as the Rebel fighters approach.
Complex patterns on the metallic surface begin to become visible.
A large dish antenna is built into the surface on one side.
Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome spectacle.
WEDGE Look at the size of that thing!
RED LEADER Cut the chatter, Red Two.
RED LEADER Accelerate to attack speed.
RED LEADER This is it, boys!
As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed.
Half of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a city at night as seen from a weather satellite.
GOLD LEADER Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
RED LEADER I copy, Gold Leader.
GOLD LEADER We're starting for the target shaft now.
Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming in from behind.
Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in the background.
He moves his computer targeting device into position.
RED LEADER We're in position.
RED LEADER I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.
Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off.
The X-wings dive towards the Death Star surface.
A thousand lights glow across the dark grey expanse of the huge station.
Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo- powered laser gun emplacements.
Electronic drivers rotate the huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting devices.
Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night.
The Rebel X- wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and fires.
Princess Leia listens to the battle over the intercom.
Threepio is at her side.
WEDGE Heavy fire, boss!
WEDGE Twenty-degrees.
RED LEADER I see it.
RED LEADER Stay low.
An X-wing zooms across the surface of the Death Star.
Technical crews scurry here and there loading last-minute armaments and unlocking power cables.
Wedge maneuvers his fighter toward the menacing Death Star.
X-wings continue in their attack course on the Death Star.
Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous fortress.
The Death Star surface streaks past the cockpit window.
LUKE This is Red Five; I'm going in!
Luke's X-wing races toward the Death Star.
Laserbolts streak from Luke's weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on the dim surface.
Terror crosses Luke's face as he realizes he won't be able to pull out in time to avoid the fireball.
BIGGS Luke, pull up!
Luke's ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges of his wings slightly scorched.
BIGGS Are you all right?
Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief.
Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.
LUKE I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.
Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface with laserbolts.
Walls buckle and cave in.
Troops and equipment are blown in all directions.
Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.
Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and foreboding, is Darth Vader.
One of his Astro-Officers rushes up to him.
ASTRO-OFFICER We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.
ASTRO-OFFICER But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!
VADER We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
