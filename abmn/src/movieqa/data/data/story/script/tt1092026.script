Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming 10:19pm 28/07/47
The air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night.
A light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window.
The door opens, a small dog and a young girl emerge.
GIRL Go on now Paul, don't be long.
The dog trots out across the property.
It stops to scratch.
The sounds of night cease.
The dog stops scratching, sniffing the air, cocking its head, sensing something.
We hear a low humming sounds.
The dog looks up.
We see a soft orange glow reflected in its eyes.
The dog whimpers Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground, bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda.
An orange glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.
GIRL Paul...
GIRL Paul?
GIRL The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.
GIRL Paul?!
GIRL The glow fades again.
GIRL MUSIC: "The Boy In The Bubble"? by Paul Simon.
GRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road.
GRAHAM is thin but his clothes seem too small.
He has long greasy hair, buck teeth and thick glasses.
CLIVE is bigger and wears a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots.
His hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid.
Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by.
GRAHAM and CLIVE shrug derisively.
The cross-walk beeps.
As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the road towards the San Diego Convention Centre.
They make their way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees.
GRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand.
CLIVE is brandishing a KATANA SWORD.
He test the balance, the weight, the sharpness.
He closes one eye and looks down the length of the blade.
He nods appreciatively.
CLIVE Beautiful piece.
VENDER Damn straight.
VENDER Practical performance.
VENDER 100% Japanese, folded steel.
VENDER Real hero shit.
CLIVE How much?
CLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away.
GRAHAM Aren't you gonna get it?
CLIVE No, it's rubbish.
INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY We see them on an escalator, walking down a wide corridor, passing people in a variety of costumes.
INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY Finally, they join a line of people waiting to meet the actor, MICHAEL BIEHN.
GRAHAM What are you going to ask?
CLIVE Do you feel that the killing of Hicks and Newt in Alien 3, invalidates Ripley's struggle at the closed of the previous installment?
GRAHAM I was going to ask that!
Tough tits four eyes.
SECURITY Alright, next!
SECURITY Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches.
SECURITY MICHAEL BIEHN is signing pictures.
SECURITY He is pleasant, if business like.

MICHAEL BIEHN SECURITY moves CLIVE on.
MICHAEL BIEHN CLIVE scrambles for his camera.
CLIVE I...
CLIVE I need to photograph him.
SECURITY You can take it from there.
SECURITY CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position themselves with MICHAEL BIEHN in the background.
SECURITY CLIVE takes the shot.
SECURITY We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background.
SECURITY The pair move off, looking at their spoils.
GRAHAM That was amazing.
GRAHAM I was actually a bit nervous.
CLIVE Really?
CLIVE I wasn't.
GRAHAM Good egg, wasn't he?
CLIVE Yes, very unaffected.
CLIVE Damn, I forgot to give him my card.
CLIVE CLIVE points at SECURITY.
GRAHAM Give it to Colossus.
CLIVE Nah.
CLIVE Hey, Rosario Dawson's here!
GRAHAM She NEEDS to call me.
INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER GRAHAM and CLIVE sit at a table fiddling nervously with pens.
INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER On either side of them are stacks of their new book; JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN OF THE VARVAK.
INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER A banner hangs behind, displaying the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini rides a blue rhino.

INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER A lanky publicist paces up and down, making sure everything is in order.
PUBLICIST Looks good, right?
CLIVE Yes, it's very impressive.
PUBLICIST It really does the image justice.

CLIVE That was Graham's idea.
PUBLICIST Ladies man, huh?
PUBLICIST You guys happy?

GRAHAM When do we start?
PUBLICIST Ten minutes ago.
CLIVE Why is it so quiet?
PUBLICIST Sylar's doing a Q and A in the main pavillion.
CLIVE Oh man!
CLIVE I wanted to go to that .
CLIVE I wanted to find out if he actually eats the brains.
PUBLICIST I can make a call.
CLIVE Please.
PUBLICIST It'll pick up when he's done.

INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER CLIVE looks a little downbeat, GRAHAM fidgets with his pens.
PUBLICIST Okay, that's the hour.
PUBLICIST How'd we do?
CLIVE Three copies.
PUBLICIST Hey, one for each tit.
PUBLICIST Maybe you should have given her four.
GRAHAM That's sick.
PUBLICIST Don't sweat it.
PUBLICIST It's a sleeper.
CLIVE Yeah, but three copies?
PUBLICIST Better than Carl Weathers.
GRAHAM Would you like a copy?
PUBLICIST Are you nuts?
PUBLICIST My office is full of junk.
PUBLICIST The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling.
CLIVE Graham, I need a drink.
GRAHAM and CLIVE are stood against the wall in a bar.
GRAHAM drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw.
CLIVE sips from a Jack Daniels and Coke.
Everyone else in the bar is dressed as a HOBBIT.
CLIVE winks at a girl.
GRAHAM and CLIVE's hotel room is filled with bags of stuff from the convention, a laptop computer and a games console plugged into the TV.
GRAHAM lies on his bed.
He is looking at a map.
Other maps are scattered about.
CLIVE It was like the Prancing Pony in there.
GRAHAM Nasty Hobbitses.
GRAHAM CLIVE emerges from the bathroom.
GRAHAM He is naked but for a black towel wrapped around his waist.
GRAHAM His hair is wet and suddenly incredibly long.
GRAHAM Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs on a black leather cord.
CLIVE They think they're so cool.
GRAHAM Hey, are you excited about going to Area 51?
CLIVE Hell yes.
GRAHAM 06.30 check out?
CLIVE A-ffirmative.
CLIVE GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches.
CLIVE Three, two, one...
Beep.
Beep.
CLIVE Good night, Graham.
GRAHAM Good night, Clive.
GRAHAM They switch off their respective bedside lights.
GRAHAM The room is plunged into pitch darkness.
GRAHAM A few seconds pass.
GRAHAM Are you asleep?
CLIVE No.
GRAHAM Shall we try and storm the Citadel before we nod off?
CLIVE Couldn't hurt could it?
CLIVE We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV.
CLIVE The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers.
CLIVE Cover me.
GRAHAM and CLIVE stand at reception.
Both look extremely sleepy.
CLIVE's eyes close.
GRAHAM lolls forward onto the reception desk.
His head hits the bell.
The boys stand, waiting for their transport.
We see them from across the road.
A tiny old car splutters up to the curb.
A valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE.
VALET There you go.
GRAHAM That's not ours.
VALET No?
CLIVE No, that's ours.
CLIVE A large RV pulls up.
CLIVE A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial.
CLIVE Top of the range in its day.
CLIVE Still looks good.
VALET Oh.
VALET GRAHAM and CLIVE run off toward the RV.
VALET The four BORG from the previous day approach the VALET and exchange the key to the car for some small change.
VALET The BORG drive off.
VALET Fucking Borg.
VALET Assimilate this!
VALET The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET.
VALET GRAHAM and CLIVE can be heard whooping within.
INT. RV - MORNING CLIVE is seated behind the wheel of their RV, he now wears black wrap-around shades.
INT. RV - MORNING In the back of the RV, GRAHAM fusses with maps and provisions.
GRAHAM Breakfast?
CLIVE Java.
CLIVE Straight up.
GRAHAM Any solids?
CLIVE No, let's punch through.
CLIVE Miles make the eggs taste sweeter.
GRAHAM I love eggs!
CLIVE I hear that.
CLIVE Now, get that "?Joe' on the go and jump in the Chewie seat.
CLIVE I need your map skills.
GRAHAM Good job I pre-pared.
GRAHAM GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's (Chewie) seat.
GRAHAM It's a shame I don't have some controls on this side.
GRAHAM That way, I could take over if you needed the loo.
CLIVE Yeah, I could say "take the helm."
GRAHAM "Take the helm, number one."
CLIVE Yeah, "take the helm, number one, I need a number two."
CLIVE ? They laugh heartily.
CLIVE Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out his laptop and setting it up on the dash board.
GRAHAM "?Least I've got Cerebro, eh?
CLIVE Absolutely.
CLIVE Real-time sat-nav multi map and advanced geo-tagging with continual info stream?
GRAHAM Impressive.
CLIVE Most impressive.
GRAHAM And let's not forget, we've always got Analogue.
GRAHAM GRAHAM pulls a map down.
GRAHAM Obscuring the entire windshield.
CLIVE Not when we're driving Graham.
GRAHAM Sorry.
GRAHAM GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller.
GRAHAM The coffee percolator gurgles in the galley.
GRAHAM Sounds like coffee o'clock.
CLIVE Thank god.
CLIVE I'm a wreck until I've had my first cup of J.
CLIVE GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.
GRAHAM and CLIVE eat lunch.
GRAHAM has finished a plate of prawns.
He inspects the shells.
GRAHAM Looks like a pile of dead droids.
GRAHAM A perky waitress approaches.
GRAHAM GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and awkward.
You boys all set?
Can I get you anything else?
GRAHAM spills his drink.
CLIVE appears very uneasy.
INT/EXT. RV - DAY They drive in silence, surveying the landscape.
CLIVE Amazing, isn't it?
CLIVE There are 295,734,134 people in this country and we haven't seen a soul for a hundred miles.
CLIVE Where is everybody?
GRAHAM What about that old woman on crutches we saw hitchhiking?
CLIVE Apart from her.
CLIVE I suppose that's why they established the Dreamland facility out here.
GRAHAM Far from prying eyes.
CLIVE Did you know the site was selected in the mid-1950s for testing of the U-2 spyplane, due to its remoteness, proximity to existing facilities and presence of a dry lake bad for landings?
GRAHAM Yes.
CLIVE Oh.
GRAHAM Shall we have a bite before or after we hit the Black Mailbox?
CLIVE Before.
INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING GRAHAM and CLIVE tuck into burgers.
INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING They are the only customers.
INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING The interior is replete with various Area 51 related memorabilia.
INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING PAT, (female, 50s) the proprietor, speaks to them from behind the counter.
INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING She holds up two bumper stickers.
PAT "Watch The Skies"? or "Alien Onboard?"? GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before looking back at PAT.
GRAHAM/CLIVE "Alien Onboard."
PAT Nice choice.
PAT So, where have you boys come from?
San Diego.
PAT Comic-Con?
CLIVE How could you tell?
CLIVE We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT.
CLIVE They look like the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever.
PAT Just a guess.
PAT My nephew launched a comic down there a couple of years ago.
PAT Sort of dramatized the accounts of some of the folk we've had in here.
CLIVE Encounter Briefs?
PAT That's it.
PAT You heard of it, huh?
CLIVE I've got all six.
PAT Well whaddya know?
PAT Small world.
CLIVE Do you get a lot of UFO types round here?
CLIVE We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face.
PAT Some.
GRAHAM Have you ever seen one?
PAT A UFO?
PAT Oh, I've seen plenty.
GRAHAM Really?!
GRAHAM You've seen more than one UFOs?
PAT Well, I don't know what they were.
PAT So as far as I'm concerned they're unidentified and they were definitely flying.
CLIVE And objects.
PAT Damn straight.
PAT Whether or not they were spaceships, I can't say.
PAT Probably not, but I'd like to think they were.
PAT Be a shame if we were the only souls in the universe.
CLIVE Did you now, it's estimated that there are as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe and each of those has approximately 40 billion starts, around which orbit countless planets and moons?
PAT Yes.
CLIVE Oh.
PAT Makes you think though, don't it?
CLIVE What?
PAT Where is everybody?
PAT GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this.
PAT You boys all set?
CLIVE I'd like a cup of coffee please.
PAT Sure thing.
PAT How about you, sugar?
GRAHAM Can I have an E.T. malt please?
PAT You wanna sparkler in that?
PAT GRAHAM smiles coyly.
PAT I'll take that as a yes.
PAT She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen.
PAT GRAHAM and CLIVE are left alone.
PAT They take it all in.
CLIVE It's nice here, isn't it?
GRAHAM Absolutely.
CLIVE I think I might use the loo.
CLIVE CLIVE walks through a door marked "?Maliens'.
CLIVE The adjacent toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter.
CLIVE GRAHAM becomes uneasy.
PAT Yes dear, what can I get you?
JAKE Two beers.
PAT Coming right up.
CLIVE washes his hands.
He pumps soap from a dispenser which is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its mouth.
CLIVE is quite taken with this.
CLIVE That is absolutely amazing!
INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING CLIVE appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air.
CLIVE Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up into my palms.
CLIVE CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter.
CLIVE He strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement.
CLIVE I'm joking, of course.
CLIVE They have a soap dispenser, shaped like an alien's head.
CLIVE When you pump his jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.
Clive...
CLIVE It's hilarious.
CLIVE GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.
CLIVE What?
CLIVE CLIVE looks over and sees the two men.
CLIVE They are glaring back.
CLIVE CLIVE immediately loses his confident air.
PAT Here it comes!
PAT GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered.
PAT The two men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of drinks.
PAT Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler.
PAT Okay then, beers for you gentleman.
PAT A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt with a sparkler for the boys from outer space.
PAT The man snigger derisively.
PAT PAT senses the tension.
PAT So, where you boys headed?
JAKE We're heading into Utah.
JAKE Do ourselves some hunting.
GUS Deer, coon, beaver, whatever steps in front of the bangstick, right Jake?
GUS They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE.
JAKE You got that right, Gus.
PAT Well now, I heard Utah beaver puts up quite a fight.
GUS That's what we're counting on.
GUS They nudge each other and laugh.
PAT I better make you something good and hot.
PAT Long way to The Beehive.
PAT PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look.
PAT CLIVE understands and fumbles for hi wallet.
He places a number of bills on the table.
They leave.
GRAHAM comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker.
PAT gives him a wink.
He leaves.
GRAHAM boards the RV.
CLIVE is in the driver's seat.
The engine is running.
CLIVE What took you so long?
GRAHAM I was putting the sticker on.
CLIVE They were an odd pair, weren't they?
GRAHAM Definitely didn't speak Bocci.
GRAHAM CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse.
GRAHAM CRUNCH.
That wasn't their truck was it?
CLIVE No.
The RV roars off, leaving the car park and the black Lincoln Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.
INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT GRAHAM looks at a map.
INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT CLIVE drives, continually checking his rear view.
GRAHAM What's the matter?
CLIVE Nothing.
CLIVE How we doing?
GRAHAM We should be just about there.
GRAHAM They scan the roadside for a few seconds.
CLIVE I've found it.
GRAHAM Where?
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT The RV comes to a screeching halt.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT It sits in the road for a moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT The door opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE appear wearing head mounted torches.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT They wander over to a WHITE mailbox.
The Black Mailbox.
GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it.
The silence of the night and the size of the landscape dawns on them.
They look up.
CLIVE It's amazing, isn't it?
CLIVE We're actually here.
GRAHAM Area 51.
CLIVE Dreamland.
GRAHAM The Groom Lake Military Test Facility.
CLIVE MacArthur's Black Mile.
GRAHAM Is that a real one?
CLIVE No, I made it up myself.
GRAHAM I like it.
CLIVE Be great if we saw something.
GRAHAM Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by a craft.
CLIVE That would be incredible.
CLIVE It just sort of stops in the air and hovers then just goes up really fast.
CLIVE Whoosh.
GRAHAM What would you do if they actually landed?
CLIVE Keep it together.
CLIVE First contact is a big responsibility.
CLIVE They come in peace, we go to pieces?
CLIVE That's not how I roll.
CLIVE CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed.
CLIVE What's wrong?
CLIVE GRAHAM points off into the distance.
CLIVE HEADLIGHTS.
GRAHAM It's them.
GRAHAM They found us.
GRAHAM I don't know how but they found us.
CLIVE Who?
CLIVE Who's found us?
GRAHAM The Libyans!
CLIVE Run for it Marty!
CLIVE GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV.
INT. RV - NIGHT CLIVE drives, GRAHAM looks nervous.
INT. RV - NIGHT In the dashboard of the RV is a rear view monitor.
INT. RV - NIGHT They look at it intently.
GRAHAM Perhaps it's not them.
GRAHAM Perhaps whoever it was turned doff.
CLIVE Of course it's them.
CLIVE We're dead.
CLIVE It's like Deliverance.
CLIVE They're going to rape us and break our arms.
GRAHAM I don't want my arms broken!
CLIVE There's only one thing for it.
GRAHAM What?
CLIVE I'm gonna have to fly blind.
CLIVE kills the headlights.
They are plunged into darkness, still travelling at 65mph.
The headlights come back on.
CLIVE Probably best not to do that.
CLIVE I couldn't really see anything.
CLIVE They stare at the monitor.
CLIVE Suddenly, creeping up the rear of the RV, headlights.
CLIVE The front of a car becomes visible.
CLIVE Oh God, oh God, oh God.
GRAHAM I need the toilet.
CLIVE Me too.
CLIVE The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.
CLIVE They're trying to overtake.
GRAHAM Don't let them get past.
CLIVE Should I ram them?
GRAHAM What about the deposit?
GRAHAM CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve.
GRAHAM A BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to avoid the RV.
GRAHAM GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times, bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on its roof.
GRAHAM GRAHAM's mouth hangs open.
GRAHAM CLIVE blinks.
CLIVE It wasn't them.
CLIVE The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops.
CLIVE GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out of the window.
CLIVE We should see if they're okay.
GRAHAM I still need a wee.
CLIVE I can hold mine.
CLIVE GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet.
CLIVE CLIVE remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled Sedan.
CLIVE The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.
GRAHAM The bulb's gone in there.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT GRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT Inside are three unconscious men.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT One door is open.
CLIVE Hello?
CLIVE They wait for a few seconds.
CLIVE Nothing.
GRAHAM Maybe you should call for help.
GRAHAM GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.
VOICE I wouldn't do that if I were you.
VOICE GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness.
VOICE The glow of a cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large, black eyes.
VOICE GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp.
CLIVE I rather think these men need help.
CLIVE Graham, give me the phone.
CLIVE GRAHAM passes the phone over.
VOICE Seriously, I wouldn't do that.
VOICE GRAHAM's mouth falls open, CLIVE continues to hold the phone to his ear.
VOICE We hear the operator.
OPERATOR 911 Emergency.
OPERATOR How may I direct your call?
OPERATOR Hello?
OPERATOR Hello?
OPERATOR GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp.
OPERATOR The shape stand and steps into the light.
OPERATOR GRAHAM and CLIVE go slack.
OPERATOR Standing in front of them, clad only in cut-off short and flip-flops...
OPERATOR is an
ALIEN Put - the phone - down.
ALIEN Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks backwards in a dead faint.
ALIEN He hits the ground with a bump.
ALIEN GRAHAM looks at CLIVE then back at the ALIEN.
ALIEN When GRAHAM speaks his voice quivers with hysterical panic.
GRAHAM What have you done to him?
ALIEN I didn't do anything.
ALIEN He fainted.
GRAHAM Yes but you made him faint.
ALIEN I did not.
ALIEN Okay I did, but it's not like i set my phaser to "?Faint'.
GRAHAM You've got a phaser!?
ALIEN No!
ALIEN Look, I need you to help.
ALIEN Can you get this guy back onto your wagon?
GRAHAM Are you going to probe us?
ALIEN No!
ALIEN Where does that come from?
ALIEN Why do people always assume we want to stick something up their ass?
GRAHAM Don't you?
ALIEN No.
ALIEN There's certainly nothing about it in the encounter manual.
ALIEN As a rule, we don't even abduct.
ALIEN Maybe people find it easier to deal with earthly transgressions if they suppress it with absurd fantasies about alien probing.
GRAHAM What?
ALIEN It's just a theory.
ALIEN Listen, focus okay?
ALIEN I promise you I won't hurt you, I just need your help.
GRAHAM You need my help?
ALIEN Yes.
GRAHAM How come I can understand you?
GRAHAM Are you using some sort of neural language router?
ALIEN No, I'm speaking English you prick.
ALIEN Sorry, I'm tense.
ALIEN Look, what's your name?
GRAHAM Graham Willy.
ALIEN What about him?
GRAHAM That's the writer, Clive Gollings.
ALIEN Well, let's get Clive into the RV and get going.
ALIEN I'll explain everything on the way.
ALIEN Please.
GRAHAM Where are we going?
ALIEN North.
GRAHAM The RV's gotta be back in 2 days.
ALIEN Well, then we're gonna have to hustle, aren't we?
ALIEN Look Graham, you're just gonna have to trust me, okay?
ALIEN GRAHAM looks at the ALIEN.
ALIEN It stands at roughly 3 feet tall.
ALIEN His black almond shaped eye glint.
ALIEN His large head tilts to one side, his small mouth opens slightly, his long fingers clasp together, pleading.
ALIEN Please man, I need you.
ALIEN GRAHAM considers the ALIEN for a moment.
GRAHAM Okay then.
ALIEN Great.
ALIEN Thank you.
GRAHAM What's your name?
ALIEN I'm Paul.
GRAHAM Paul?
PAUL Yeah.
PAUL Now let's get Cloverfield onto the recreational vehicle and get the fuck off MacArthur's Black Mile.
PAUL They attempt to move CLIVE.
PAUL PAUL senses something.
PAUL (CONT'D) Oh man, has he...?
GRAHAM I told him he should have gone.
PAUL Could have been worse.
PAUL Know what I'm saying?
PAUL They drag him into the RV.
PAUL The door shuts, a few seconds later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV.
PAUL He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board.
PAUL The RV starts up and drives off.
INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT GRAHAM drives, agitated.
INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT He looks behind him a couple of times.
INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT PAUL is hunting around in the fridge.
PAUL Can I have this ham?
GRAHAM Uh...
GRAHAM yes.
PAUL Great!
PAUL PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth, wolfing it down hungrily.
GRAHAM Paul?
GRAHAM Where am I going again?
PAUL I told you, North.
PAUL Do you have a map?
PAUL GRAHAM pulls the map.
PAUL It obscures the wind shield.
PAUL Not when we're driving, Graham.
The map disappears back up into the roller.
GRAHAM Sorry.
PAUL Just head North.
PAUL We need to get as much distance as we can between us and them.
GRAHAM Them?
GRAHAM Who's them?
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT We hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT A suited man gets out of a Sedan car.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT We don't see his face at first.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT The shot remains at his hip.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a Twinkie.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT He unwraps it and brings it up to his mouth.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT We follow and see his face for the first time.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT Chiselled, focused, confident.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL.
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT A SOLDIER approaches.
CAPTAIN Sir?
ZOIL Talk to me.
CAPTAIN Three survivors, company men, hurt but alive.
ZOIL Anyone else?
CAPTAIN No sir.
CAPTAIN ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air.
CAPTAIN What's this?
CAPTAIN The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet.
CAPTAIN ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger.
CAPTAIN What is it sir?
CAPTAIN Brake fluid?
CAPTAIN Gas?
ZOIL No.
ZOIL It's neither of those things.
ZOIL He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the side of the road.
ZOIL ZOIL stands, full of purpose.
ZOIL He returns to his car and hits a button on the dash.
VOICE What's the situation?
ZOIL We have a guest who's left the hotel without paying, sir.
VOICE Damn it!
VOICE Do you think he's "?left' left?
ZOIL Doubtful.
ZOIL NORAD would have picked up a bogie.
ZOIL Those guys can track Santa.
ZOIL No sir, he's still here.
ZOIL Question is, for how long?
VOICE Don't you think this is all a bit of a coincidence?
ZOIL How so?
VOICE I signed the red document this morning, Zoil.
VOICE Don't you think it's odd that he chooses today to go AWOL?
VOICE How did he know?
ZOIL Are you suggesting he has someone on the inside.
VOICE Maybe.
ZOIL Well he's definitely got someone on the outside.
VOICE What?
ZOIL Tire tracks, sir.
ZOIL Tire tracks...
ZOIL among other things.
ZOIL I'd bet my left nut that little bastard's hitched a ride.
VOICE Lock down the area.
VOICE Road blocks, spot checks, the whole nine yards.
VOICE You're going to handle this personally, Zoil.
VOICE I want this wrapped up before Letterman.
Close on the wheel.
Pull out to reveal the RV.
Inside, CLIVE's eyes open.
From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder.
He notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry.
He leans out to see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the bathroom door.
The toilet flushes.
CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens.
A pair of skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk.
PAUL The bulb's gone in there.
PAUL CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his middle.
PAUL He creeps toward the front of the RV.
PAUL GRAHAM drives, PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios.
PAUL I hate it when you get the closed ones, right?
GRAHAM I usually bite them open.
PAUL Are you fucking insane?
PAUL You gotta tap "?em and if they don't open you throw them away.
GRAHAM That's molluscs.
PAUL Shut up.
GRAHAM It's true.
Hello Clive!
How are you feeling?
CLIVE I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL MAD, Graham.
CLIVE If that is your name?
CLIVE You're happily sitting there chatting to...
CLIVE to...
CLIVE that, like it's the most natural thing in the world.
CLIVE The two of you laughing away like you haven't seen each other since 1990.
CLIVE PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.
CLIVE (CONT'D) So forgive me if I seem a little rattled but from where I'm standing it would appear you are trading nut knowledge with an alien life form.
GRAHAM His name is Paul.
CLIVE Oh, Paul is it?
CLIVE Paul what?
CLIVE Paul Verhoven?
CLIVE Paul Freeman?
CLIVE Paul Reiser?
PAUL Just Paul.
PAUL You know, like Madonna or Dracula.
GRAHAM Paul's from a small planet in the northern spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy.
CLIVE No he is not!
PAUL I am man, seriously.
CLIVE How could he possibly have travelled that distance?
PAUL Wormhole.
CLIVE Balls!
CLIVE Graham, this isn't what it seems.
CLIVE What about Ocham's Razor?
GRAHAM The hairdressers?
CLIVE Yes, the old man who owns it told me that, in unbelievable circumstances, the most plausible explanation is usually the truth.
PAUL And what's the most plausible explanation, Clive?
CLIVE That you're a thin midget in an alien costume.
PAUL There's no such thing as a thin midget?
PAUL Those guys are built.
PAUL Have you not seen The Station Agent?
GRAHAM He's right.
GRAHAM I think that's less believable than Paul being form a planet in the norther spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy.
CLIVE (CONT'D) Oh really?
CLIVE (CONT'D) With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL.
CLIVE (CONT'D) He pulls at the alien's skin, trying to gain a hold of a mask.
PAUL Ow!
PAUL Get off me!
CLIVE You're not real.
CLIVE You're not real!
GRAHAM Excuse me.
PAUL Get off me, you fucking psycho!
CLIVE releases PAUL and looks out of the RV to see the flashing lights of a road block.
GRAHAM slows down.
CLIVE Oh shit!
CLIVE CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished.
CLIVE GRAHAM pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder.
CLIVE Where's he gone?
GRAHAM Maybe he beamed up.
CLIVE As if.
CLIVE We would have seen the classic shimmer and hum.
GRAHAM Good point.
GRAHAM and CLIVE look to the door.
Both terrified.
EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT GRAHAM and CLIVE stand outside the RV being questioned by an AGENT dressed like ZOIL.
EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT We can hear noise and activity from the RV.
EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT Another AGENT is aboard the RV.
AGENT 1 Where you boys from?
AGENT 1 Australia?
CLIVE Britain.
AGENT 1 Ah.
AGENT 1 G'day mate.
AGENT 1 The AGENT smiles.
AGENT 1 GRAHAM and CLIVE look terrified.
AGENT 1 Whatcha doin' in the US fellas?
Comic-con.
AGENT 1 You're a long way from San Diego.
CLIVE We were having a little drive.
AGENT 1 Is that right?
Hey Haggard?!
HAGGARD Yeah?
HAGGARD O'REILLY appears at the door waving a 10x8"? photograph.
O'REILLY These guys have met Michael Biehn.
HAGGARD No shit!
HAGGARD How was he?
CLIVE He was a good egg.
GRAHAM Very unaffected.
HAGGARD That's nice to hear.
O'Reilly?
Anything else?
O'REILLY Just some pissy jeans.
O'REILLY HAGGARD looks down at the towel wrapped around CLIVE's waits.
O'REILLY CLIVE look embarrassed.
HAGGARD Okay, you guys can go.
CLIVE Thank you.
CLIVE May I ask what you're searching for?
HAGGARD Of course you may.
HAGGARD There is a slight pause.
HAGGARD GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV.
INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT GRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence.
INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT They are both confused and shaken.
CLIVE Well, it's pretty obvious what happened there, isn't it?
GRAHAM Is it?
CLIVE Yes, the government used some sort of neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox, which was white by the way, and it caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien.
CLIVE I mean, it's what we've always wanted, isn't it?
GRAHAM I suppose so.
CLIVE Than that's what happened.
CLIVE PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.
EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT The sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two AGENTS.
EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT They see the RV swerve across the road in the distance before righting itself and continuing on its way.
CLIVE Where the hell did you go?
PAUL Nowhere.
GRAHAM What, you went invisible?
PAUL It's not invisibility per so.
PAUL It's more like what a chameleon does with a little light blending thrown in for good measure.
GRAHAM Like Predator?
PAUL Exactly.
GRAHAM Can you do it whenever you want?
Anytime...
We hear GRAHAM squeal with delight.
The RV guns up the road into the night.
INT. RV - DAYBREAK CLIVE drives in silence.
INT. RV - DAYBREAK PAUL sits in the passenger seat eating nuts.
INT. RV - DAYBREAK Day is breaking over the horizon.
INT. RV - DAYBREAK GRAHAM snoozes on the sofa.
INT. RV - DAYBREAK PAUL offers CLIVE a nut.
CLIVE No thank you.
PAUL You sure?
PAUL How about a cup of coffee?
PAUL Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice cuppa J.
PAUL PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as he passes.
PAUL GRAHAM wakes up with a start.
PAUL Hey, look who's up!
GRAHAM Hello Paul.
GRAHAM GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him.
GRAHAM What's the matter?
CLIVE Graham, there is a Grey in the galley, making me coffee.
GRAHAM Did you want tea?
CLIVE No, I don't want tea.
GRAHAM Tea's a bit weird in America, isn't it?
CLIVE No, what's wried, Graham, is that we have picked up an extra terrestrial hitch hiker and you seem completely fine with it!
GRAHAM He needs our help, Clive.
GRAHAM PAUL returns with the coffee.
GRAHAM GRAHAM and CLIVE curtail their conversation.
GRAHAM PAUL hand CLIVE his coffee.
PAUL CLIVE You got it?
PAUL CLIVE Yes I've got it.
PAUL CLIVE It's hot.
PAUL CLIVE (slightly testy) Thank you.
PAUL CLIVE GRAHAM looks at Paul and nods toward CLIVE.
PAUL CLIVE PAUL sighs and sits in the Chewie seat.
PAUL CLIVE GRAHAM hangs back...
PAUL Look Clive, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is probably the weirdest thing that's ever happened to you.
PAUL Am i right?
PAUL CLIVE doesn't deny it.
PAUL And I appreciate the fact that I have somewhat gate-crashed the party here but, truth be told, I'm in a hell of a pickle.
PAUL I really need your help.
CLIVE Why us?
PAUL Why not?
PAUL CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM.
CLIVE What about the RV?
CLIVE It has to be back in two days.
GRAHAM Clive, he's an alien.
GRAHAM A living, breathing, alien.
GRAHAM CLIVE look at PAUL who makes a sad face and does the hand gesture from Close Encounters.
GRAHAM CLIVE wilts.
CLIVE I suppose we could phone the hire company and get an extension.
CLIVE PAUL looks super-pleased.
CLIVE How did you get here?
PAUL Crashed in "?47.
PAUL Anti-grav failure.
GRAHAM Happens to the best of us.
PAUL Also, I'm a shit driver.
CLIVE Oh my God!
CLIVE Roswell?!
CLIVE That was you?!
PAUL Roswell was a smoke-screen man, designed to distract from the truth.
CLIVE They invented a fake alien crash to distract from an actual alien crash?
PAUL I know, fucking stupid, isn't it?
CLIVE What have you been doing here all this time?
PAUL Oh you know, kickin' back, shooting the shit.
PAUL Advising the government.
GRAHAM Not just the government.
A room lit by a single bulb, furnished with a table and chair.
PAUL sits with his back to us, he is smoking a cigarette, whilst talking on the phone.
We hear the voice on the other end of the line.
It is strangely familiar.
STEVEN SPIELBERG ...I want him to have some kind of special power, you know?
STEVEN SPIELBERG Something sort of messianic...
PAUL How about molecular revivification.
STEVEN SPIELBERG I don't know what that is.
PAUL Restoration of damaged tissue through telepathic manipulation of cellular intrinsic field memory.
STEVEN SPIELBERG I...uh...
PAUL Healing, Steven.
STEVEN SPIELBERG Oh right yeah.
STEVEN SPIELBERG Like by touch sort of thing?
STEVEN SPIELBERG His little finger could light up at the end and-
PAUL You know what?
PAUL Sometimes, less is more.
PAUL The line beeps.
STEVEN SPIELBERG You got another call?
PAUL Yeah I gotta take this man.
PAUL It's the fucking V guys again.
PAUL Right.
GRAHAM You'd be surprised how much he's influenced popular culture generally over the last 60 years.
How come you know so much?
GRAHAM We had quite a long chat while you were unconscious.
GRAHAM CLIVE looks miffed.
GRAHAM ...while you were asleep.
PAUL You want a bagel Clive?
CLIVE No thanks.
PAUL Graham?
GRAHAM Yes please.
CLIVE Go on then, I'll have half.
PAUL You want anything on it?
CLIVE Jam.
PAUL What?
CLIVE Jelly.
PAUL Gotcha.
PAUL PAUL heads to the kitchen.
PAUL The boys drive in silence.
GRAHAM I gave your jeans a swill and hung them up.
CLIVE Thank you.
CLIVE So, do you know where we're going?
GRAHAM Just North.
GRAHAM He said we had to make a right at Utah.
CLIVE Why can't he tell us?
GRAHAM He said it was a surprise.
CLIVE Do you trust him, Graham?
CLIVE I mean, is he Strider or Black Rider?
GRAHAM Strider, definitely.
CLIVE You'd better be right.
CLIVE I don't want to wake up and find him inserting a probe into my anus.
GRAHAM It's okay, he doesn't do that.
GRAHAM PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger.
PAUL Bagel time!
PAUL The dashboard beeps.
PAUL PAUL jumps throwing them into the air.
GRAHAM Fuel level's critical.
PAUL Sorry, I had a warning light just like that on my ship.
GRAHAM For fuel?
PAUL Anti-grav failure.
PAUL CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer.
CLIVE There's a place called Ely five miles from here.
CLIVE It's small but there should be a gas station.
GRAHAM Roger that, number one.
CLIVE smiles at GRAHAM and flashes PAUL a triumphant look.
PAUL coughs loudly, barely disguising the word "Geeks"?.
INT. RV - MORNING GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out at the gas station.
INT. RV - MORNING It appears deserted.
INT. RV - MORNING PAUL has his head in the fridge, he cracks open a V8, strolls to the front of the RV and honks the horn.
INT. RV - MORNING An OLD MAN peers out of the gas station window and waves.
CLIVE Paul, don't do that!
PAUL Here's what I need.
PAUL Some organic beef mince, organic pork, some veal, red onions, pine nuts, pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a fistful of fresh basil and 3 war ciabattas.
CLIVE You know this is a gas station?
CLIVE PAUL looks disappointed.
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY The door to the RV opens, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out onto the forecourt, trying to look as casual as they can.
CLIVE Ready?
GRAHAM Ready.
GRAHAM HOOOONNNNNKKKK!
GRAHAM GRAHAM and CLIVE jump.
PAUL Get me some more peanut M&Ms.
PAUL GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps.
PAUL A POLICE CRUISER pulls onto the forecourt.
PAUL CLIVE goes pale and fumbles the nozzle back into the pump.
PAUL He walks toward the checkout as a STATE TROOPER exits his car.
PAUL No matter how hard he tries, CLIVE cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time as the STATE TROOPER.
PAUL He is tall, wide and bald.
STATE TROOPER After you.
CLIVE Thanks.
Close up on O'REILLY.
He covers his face with his hands.
O'REILLY Coming...
O'REILLY ready or not!
O'REILLY O'REILLY uncovers his eyes and comes face to face with ZOIL.
O'REILLY ZOIL is eating an orange, he offers a segment to O'REILLY.
ZOIL Orange?
O'REILLY No thanks.
ZOIL Nice and juicy.
O'REILLY I don't want to spoil breakfast.
ZOIL Do you mind telling me what's going on, Agent?
O'REILLY Just keeping ourselves occupied sir.
O'REILLY Things are pretty slow.
ZOIL Where's the other one?
O'REILLY I don't know, let's see.
O'REILLY Haggard?
O'REILLY HAGGARD steps out from behind the only man shaped cactus on the entire desert plain.
O'REILLY O'REILLY can't help but let out a snort of delighted surprise.
O'REILLY HAGGARD hurries over.
HAGGARD Sorry, I was just...
HAGGARD hiding.
ZOIL I see.
ZOIL You fellas had much traffic through here?
HAGGARD Just a big RV driven by a couple of nerds.
ZOIL Nerds, huh?
HAGGARD Yeah, they'd been to Comic-Con and met Michael Biehn.
ZOIL I've heard he's nice.
HAGGARD Good egg.
O'REILLY Very unaffected.
ZOIL Did you search the vehicle thoroughly?
O'REILLY Yes sir.
ZOIL Find anything?
O'REILLY Not really.
O'REILLY Just Michael Biehn's autograph and some pissy jeans.
O'REILLY Close in on ZOIL.
O'REILLY He seems suddenly motivated.
ZOIL Did you get the license plate?
ZOIL HAGGARD and O'REILLY look sheepish.
ZOIL Make?
ZOIL More sheepishness.
HAGGARD It was big.
ZOIL I want everything you can remember.
ZOIL Descriptions of the occupants, height, hair, distinguishing features.
ZOIL We can do it on the way.
HAGGARD On the way?
ZOIL You're coming with me.
O'REILLY What about the road block sir?
ZOIL It didn't work.
GRAHAM joins CLIVE at the check out, clutching a bag of jerky, a bottle of chocolate milk, a burrito, a Coke, some mini doughnuts and a massive bag of peanut M&Ms.
CLIVE Don't you think that's a bit much?
CLIVE Put it all back.
CLIVE Except the burrito...
CLIVE and the doughnuts...
CLIVE and the chocolate milk.
CLIVE Let's just pay for it and leave.
GRAHAM We need bulb for the toilet.
CLIVE Essential only, Graham!
CLIVE They head to the counter.
CLIVE So does the STATE TROOPER.
STATE TROOPER Morning Chris!
CHRIS Hey Dean.
STATE TROOPER Who do you think I had in my office this morning?
CHRIS Jeremy Piven?
STATE TROOPER No.
STATE TROOPER The Secret Service.
STATE TROOPER GRAHAM bumps into a display of sunglasses and just stops it tumbling.
STATE TROOPER CHRIS and the STATE TROOPER glance over.
CHRIS They find out how you can afford a Dodge Viper on troopers pay?
STATE TROOPER Not yet.
STATE TROOPER They're all over this crash on the road up to Rachel.
CHRIS What you think's going on?
STATE TROOPER Don't know, could be Muslims.
CHRIS Jesus Cheeerist!
CHRIS CLIVE and GRAHAM sidle up to the check-out.
STATE TROOPER You go right ahead.
CLIVE Thank you very much, officer.
STATE TROOPER Where're you guys from?
GRAHAM Britain.
STATE TROOPER Britain, huh?
STATE TROOPER Nice place.
STATE TROOPER No guns!
CHRIS No guns?
CHRIS Jesus Cheeerist.
CHRIS CHRIS take the money and the boys leave.
CHRIS The STATE TROOPER and CHRIS watch them go.
The boys hurry across the forecourt past the cop car, we hear the radio spring to life as they pass.
All units, be on the lookout for a cream and brown Recreational Vehicle, no plate number at this time.
Officers are advised to contain but not board.
Dean, if you still at Gas and Go, bring back a quart a milk and a box of doughnut holes?
Dean?
GRAHAM and CLIVE stop and stare, listening intently.
PAUL sit on the sofa catching M&Ms in his mouth.
GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat.
CLIVE It's find for you.
CLIVE You'll get whisked back to whatever lab they kept you in and we'll be arrested for harbouring a fugitive and sent to Guantanamo Bay.
CLIVE PAUL laughs.
CLIVE Why's everything so funny?
CLIVE They think we're Muslims.
PAUL That's their excuse for everything.
PAUL There are worse things you can be.
PAUL We had a Muslim guy at the base.
PAUL Systems analyst called Yusef.
PAUL We used to do karaoke on Tuesday nights.
PAUL You should'a heard him do Matthew and Son.
PAUL Shame I didn't get a chance to say salam alaikum.
CLIVE Paul, the authorities know we're in an TV.
PAUL We're hardly the only RV on the road.
PAUL Trust me, if we stay off the highways, keep to the back routes, we'll have a nice uneventful journey.
PAUL BANG!!!
PAUL Something strikes the windshield.
PAUL Everyone jumps.
PAUL GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt.
PAUL Silence.
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY The door to the RV swings open, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out.
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY The desert road is silent.
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY We can see for miles.
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY On the road lies a yellow and black bird, it is very dead.
PAUL Fuck, that made me jump.
CLIVE Ah yes, the waspish markings of a Scott's Oriole.
CLIVE Unmistakable.
PAUL What a waste.
GRAHAM Poor thing.
CLIVE Nothing anyone could've done.
CLIVE PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands.
GRAHAM What are you doing?
GRAHAM PAUL closes his eyes.
GRAHAM His skin ripples with color as he sways slightly.
GRAHAM The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens its beak and tweets.
GRAHAM GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what they are seeing.
GRAHAM It's a miracle!
PAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch.
PAUL I'll miss these.
CLIVE Why would you do that?
PAUL I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY ZOIL and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas station.
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY ZOIL is talking to the STATE TROOPER and CHRIS.
STATE TROOPER By the time I got the bulletin, they were long gone.
STATE TROOPER Seemed like nice fellas to me.
CHRIS Is it true they was Muslims?
STATE TROOPER They said they were British.
ZOIL I think you can be both.
CHRIS Jesus Cheeeeerist!
HAGGARD Agent Zoil?
ZOIL Excuse me gentlemen.
ZOIL ZOIL leaves with the two men and returns to his vehicle.
ZOIL The voice of ZOIL's superior cuts the air.
VOICE Report.
ZOIL We've tracked them down to a gas station in Ely.
VOICE So why am I not witting with my feet up, smoking a jay, watching Erin Brockovich?
ZOIL We think he may be travelling in an RV with two British men sir.
VOICE Goddamnit, I knew we should have gone ahead with invasion in "?44.
VOICE What are they, MI6?
ZOIL No, sir.
ZOIL Just a couple of nerds on the lamb from Comic-Con.
VOICE Shit.
VOICE My sister's kid went to that.
VOICE Little Manga faggot.
ZOIL I still think this stinks, sir.
VOICE Like fat man doo-doo.
VOICE It's too much of a coincidence.
VOICE He sits tight for 60 years and then suddenly now he decides to take off.
VOICE If he wanted to go home so bad, he could've just given us the slip when he was playing golf with J. Edgar Hoover.
ZOIL Someone must have told him.
ZOIL We need to find the rat.
VOICE Leave that to me.
VOICE In the meantime, if E.T. is still M.I.A. in the P.M.
VOICE then F.Y.I. I'm tearing someone a new A. O.K.?
ZOIL Yes sir.
GRAHAM is sat in the Chewie seat, PAUL is reading Jelva, Queen Of The Varvak.
CLIVE drives.
GRAHAM What do you think?
PAUL Ask me when I've finished it.
PAUL CLIDE rubs his yes.
GRAHAM You tired, Sausage?
Don't call me Sausage in front of him.
GRAHAM Sorry.
GRAHAM Are you tired though?
CLIVE Mummy, I am bushed.
GRAHAM What do you need?
CLIVE Best case, I'd like a cold flannel on my neck and an honest meal.
GRAHAM I hear that, Big-Rig.
GRAHAM I can still call you Big-Rig can't I?
CLIVE Sure.
CLIVE Just not Sausage.
CLIVE Any luck with an RV park?
CLIVE We need somewhere off the beaten track, n'est pas?
GRAHAM Roger that.
GRAHAM Cup of Joe?
CLIVE You read my mind.
CLIVE GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the Chewie seat and stares at CLIVE.
CLIVE Can I help you?
PAUL You want a cigarette?
CLIVE No, thank you.
CLIVE I don't smoke.
CLIVE PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face.
PAUL Look, I'm sorry okay?
PAUL About eating the bird.
PAUL CLIVE continues to ignore PAUL.
PAUL GRAHAM arrives with the coffee and a Honey Bun cake.
GRAHAM Honey Bun?
CLIVE Could you unwrap it for me?
GRAHAM By your command.
GRAHAM unwraps the cake and pops it into CLIVE's gob.
PAUL watches.
GRAHAM disappears to the back of the RV.
PAUL Let me ask you something.
PAUL Are you to...?
CLIVE What?
PAUL You know...
PAUL PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating various "?group' and "?one on one' homosexual practices.
CLIVE No!
PAUL Okay, that's great.
PAUL I just wondered.
PAUL I'm cool with it.
PAUL Everyone's "?bi' where I'm from.
PAUL It's all about the pleasure thing, you know?
PAUL We've evolved beyond paranoid notions of gender identity.
PAUL I mean, procreation is only the functional aspect of sexual congress right?
PAUL The human race is fairly advanced but most males still act like a cornered tiger if you imply the like "?smoking the bone' and let's face it they probably do.
PAUL Look at single sex, empirical institutions, boarding schools, prisons, pirate ships, places where the choice has been removed, everyone's banging everyone else and there isn't a whiff of socio-cultural angst.
PAUL Get out into the real world and guys are getting smacked int he chops for wearing pink socks.
PAUL You think you're so sophisticated because you can distinguish yourself from your own reflection but ultimately you're part of a deeply neurotic species and you'd all be a lot better off if you stopped worrying and learned to love the bum.
CLIVE What are you trying to say?
PAUL Maybe you should start smoking.
INT. RV - EVENING Later, the RV pulls up to gate at the front of an RV park.
INT. RV - EVENING GRAHAM is now in the Chewie seat, PAUL stands behind, steadying himself on the backs of their chairs.
CLIVE Great find, Graham.
GRAHAM I sourced a website listing off the beaten track, North American RV parks.
PAUL I really lucked out with you nerds, didn't I?
PAUL GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud.
PAUL CLIVE drives the RV over a speed hump into the park.
PAUL PAUL loses his balance and falls over.
PAUL GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh.
PAUL They pull up to a gate.
GRAHAM It's awfully quiet.
CLIVE Just the way we like it.
CLIVE PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on the horn.
CLIVE Stop doing that!
GRAHAM Someone's coming.
GRAHAM PAUL shimmers and disappears.
GRAHAM GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.
VOICE Hello?
CLIVE We're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest.
GRAHAM I don't think she heard you.
CLIVE I was talking to you.
GRAHAM Oh, sorry.
VOICE Hello?
VOICE GRAHAM opens the door.
VOICE RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid- twenties stands outside.
VOICE She is pretty but has no idea.
VOICE She wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out.
VOICE GRAHAM stares at her.
VOICE We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton John's "Hopelessly Devoted To You"?.
RUTH Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe.
CLIVE Hello Ruth.
CLIVE Do you mind if we come in?
RUTH Sure.
RUTH Park in Bay 9.
RUTH The charge is $50 for the night, plus $10 for hook ups an I'll need to hang onto an ID too.
RUTH CLIVE disappears, leaving GRAHAM and RUTH alone.
GRAHAM We're just a couple of regular guys on tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest.
RUTH Where you heading next?
GRAHAM Uh, east...
GRAHAM apparently.
GRAHAM CLIVE returns with his passport.
GRAHAM RUTH looks at it.
RUTH England?
CLIVE Yes.
CLIVE London.
RUTH I love London.
CLIVE Have you been?
RUTH No.
RUTH Did you know it was founded by the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium?
GRAHAM/CLIVE Yes.
RUTH Oh.
RUTH I'd love to go someday.
GRAHAM You should.
RUTH There's lots a places I wanna go.
RUTH Europe.
RUTH Asia.
RUTH The Antipodes.
RUTH The world's a big place.
RUTH I need one of these though.
CLIVE You don't have a passport?
CLIVE RUTH shakes her head forlornly.
CLIVE GRAHAM and CLIVE stare.
RUTH!
RUTH!
Get in here!
I'm hungry
RUTH That's my father.
RUTH I'll come over and take your money in the morning.
RUTH Have a pleasant night now, won't you?
RUTH RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through.
RUTH GRAHAM watches RUTH intently as they pass.
CLIVE Doors to manual and cross check.
CLIVE Graham?
CLIVE Graham?
GRAHAM Hmmm?
GRAHAM PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE.
EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT RUTH is walking back to a static mobile home.
EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT From the RV we hear GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.
EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT RUTH furrows her brow, turns back, and goes inside.
RUTH enters a static mobile home and heads for kitchenette.
From the ad-joining room we hear the sound of someone using a police radio scanner.
Garbled reports fade in and out.
We perhaps even hear ZOIL's voice briefly amid the static.
MOSES BEHE What took you so long?
RUTH I was just talking.
RUTH stirs a pot on the stove.
She surreptitiously retrieves an atlas from a drawer an starts to read.
MOSES BEHE You talk to much.
RUTH Sorry Papa.
MOSES BEHE How long they staying?
RUTH Just the night I think
MOSES BEHE Hook ups?
RUTH Uh-huh.
MOSES BEHE Where they headed?
RUTH East.
MOSES BEHE Them California plates I saw?
RUTH Yes, but they're from London.
MOSES BEHE London, Ohio?
RUTH No, London, England.
MOSES BEHE Where?!
RUTH England, Papa.
RUTH It's in North Western Europe.
RUTH The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands.
RUTH Behind her stands the towering figure of MOSES BEHE.
RUTH Almost as wide as he is tall, his eyes glitter with fury and menace.
MOSES BEHE Europe?
MOSES BEHE I'll give you Europe, missy.
MOSES BEHE Now, get and make my supper.
MOSES BEHE MOSES lumbers off with the atlas.
MOSES BEHE RUTH looks dejected.
QUICK CUTS as GRAHAM and CLIVE hook up power and water to the RV and prepare a small BBQ.
The door to the RV opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE jump in.
PAUL lowers his book and is blinded by their headlamps.
PAUL Arrghh, what the fuck?!
GRAHAM Hungry?
PAUL I ate already.
PAUL GRAHAM and CLIVE look suddenly sad.
PAUL Too soon?
PAUL They nod.
PAUL Hey, I'm sorry.
PAUL I'd love to break bread with you guys.
PAUL What are we having?
PAUL GRAHAM waves a foot long hot dog around.
GRAHAM Willies!
GRAHAM PAUL gives CLIVE a "?see what I mean?' look.
CLIVE I'll flame up the BBQ pit.
CLIVE Fire's my forte.
CLIVE CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking mysterious.
CLIVE He then turns and jumps down all three steps and slams the door of the RV behind him.
EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT CLIVE is squirting lighter fluid over a fire.
EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT He flicks his tongue out, summoning the flames higher.
EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT PAUL materializes nearby, making CLIVE jump.
EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT He composes himself.
PAUL Hello Clive.
PAUL From the squirting of the gas and the flicking of the tongue, am I do assume you're a Hendrix fan?
CLIVE I am actually, yes.
PAUL I met him once.
CLIVE Really?
PAUL Yeah.
PAUL Nice man, really soft, He thought I was a hallucination.
PAUL Shame what happened to him.
CLIVE All the good ones die.
PAUL Meanwhile Bryan Adams releases album seventeen.
PAUL PAUL and CLIVE share a laugh.
CLIVE So you've been here for 60 years?
PAUL I know, right?
PAUL Time flies when you're confined to a U.S. military installation.
CLIVE Why did you come to earth?
PAUL I'm the vanguard of a highly aggressive invading force.
CLIVE What?!
PAUL I'm fucking with you, man.
PAUL I was on a science mission actually.
PAUL Meteorological reconnaissance.
PAUL We were surveying atmospheric conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class planets.
PAUL My specialist subject is tornadoes right?
PAUL So I'm buzzing around the mid-west, looking for twisters and all of a sudden my A.G.G.
PAUL goes offline and I crash in the middle of some field.
PAUL (CONT'D) Next thing I know, this little girl is pulling me out of the wreck and then a bunch of army guys come along and cart me off to Area 52.
PAUL No, it's 52.
PAUL Area 51 is just full of old Pan Am jets and mini disc players and shit.
PAUL It's another "clever subterfuge."
PAUL ? GRAHAM joins them with the food.
PAUL Just telling him about Area 52.
GRAHAM Ha ha yeah.
PAUL So, with my cover blown and the natives cautious but friendly, I figured we might as well indulge in a little file sharing.
CLIVE Mulder was right!
PAUL Mulder was my idea.
PAUL They chuckle.
PAUL CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.
CLIVE Would you like a go?
CLIVE PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the Hendrix face.
CLIVE They laugh loudly.
RUTH watches through her window.
GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are on the other side of the RV.
Nevertheless, RUTH can see three pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted against the campfire.
She frowns.
RUTH! RUTH backs away into the shadows.
INT. RV - MORNING It is very early in the morning.
INT. RV - MORNING PAUL is asleep on the sofa.
INT. RV - MORNING There is a knock at the door.
INT. RV - MORNING PAUL vanishes.
INT. RV - MORNING GRAHAM and CLIVE emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns.
CLIVE Who is it?
RUTH It's Ruth.
RUTH GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously.
RUTH CLIVE opens the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair.
RUTH Good morning.
CLIVE Good morning.
RUTH May I come in?
GRAHAM Yes.
GRAHAM CLIVE give GRAHAM a "?what the hell are you thinking?' Look as RUTH comes aboard.
GRAHAM RUTH surveys the interior of the RV.
RUTH Was everything to your liking?
CLIVE Yes, thank you.
RUTH Where's the other one?
CLIVE The other one?
RUTH It's okay, we don't charge by the person.
RUTH That was three pairs of legs I saw last night cavorting round the camp fire, right?
CLIVE Oh the other one.
CLIVE Um...
PAUL I'm in the can.
PAUL I ate a closed mollusc.
PAUL PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point.
PAUL GRAHAM and CLIVE look embarrassed.
PAUL GRAHAM changes the subject.
GRAHAM I like your shirt.
GRAHAM The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in the head.
GRAHAM Underneath it reads, "Evolve this!"?
RUTH Thanks.
RUTH I got it at my church.
GRAHAM Why would Jesus want to shoot Charles Darwin?
Because of his theories.
Are you men of God?
GRAHAM Would you like a coffee?
CLIVE I suppose we're men of science.
RUTH narrow her eye.
CLIVE If we believe in anything it would be macro evolution.
CLIVE Cause and effect.
CLIVE The establishment of a biological order from the maelstrom of physical and chemical chaos.
CLIVE RUTH looks scandalized.
GRAHAM Or it could be God.
GRAHAM You just don't know do you?
RUTH God created the earth in six days and on the seventh he rested.
RUTH PAUL emits another huge raspberry from the toilet.
CLIVE Did you know that the universe has been dated as being 13.5 billion years old an that the release of neutral hydrogen at the moment of the big bang has enabled scientists to do this with categorical accuracy?
GRAHAM Yes.
CLIVE Not you!
RUTH The world is 4000 years old.
PAUL Oh come on!
PAUL Horseshit!
PAUL RUTH approaches the toilet door, taking up her fight with the unseen third passenger.
PAUL She bangs on the door.
PAUL GRAHAM and CLIVE are bewildered by this sudden turn of events.
RUTH Explain to me how something as complicated as the human eye simply comes into being.
PAUL Oh, don't give me that old irreducible complexity crap-
RUTH They eye is comprised of three interacting parts.
RUTH Remove any one of them and it ceases to exist.
RUTH It has the precision and delicacy of a pocket watch and, when the good Lord permits, it works in perfect harmony with its environment.
RUTH Something as functionally perfect as that doesn't just occur without the intervention of a guiding hand.
PAUL But it didn't just occur did it?
PAUL It is the culmination of millions of years of development across countless species.
RUTH What are you talking about?
PAUL Evolution baby.
PAUL RUTH screams and bangs the door.
RUTH It'd design!
PAUL If He designed it, why didn't He just make it one part and take the whole weekend off?
RUTH Nothing you can so or do can shake my belief, or faith in the sure and certain knowledge that God made Heaven and earth and created us all in His own image.
PAUL Oh yeah?
PAUL Well then how do you explain me?
PAUL RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls up, her hair turns white.
PAUL She collapses.
PAUL And that's Jenga.
CLIVE What did you do that for?
PAUL I didn't do anything, she fainted.
CLIVE She saw you!
PAUL Oh come on.
PAUL Who's gonna believe anything she says?
CLIVE The authorities will be on the look out for exactly this sort of thing.
PAUL What, a delusional, one-eyed God botherer?
CLIVE Paul, right now they're going to follow any lead they can get.
PAUL I didn't think of that.
GRAHAM We could take her with us.
What?
GRAHAM We're only going to be a couple of days.
GRAHAM We could let her go once Paul's gone home.
GRAHAM I'm sure she'll be fine once she gets to know us.
GRAHAM PAUL and CLIVE consider this.
CLIVE How am I going to get my passport back?
CLIVE PAUL vanishes.
PAUL Leave it to me.
INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY The door opens, seemingly by itself.
INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY PAUL materializes in the kitchenette and starts looking around for CLIVE's passport.
INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY He roots around noisily in drawers and cupboards, until he spies his quarry on the work-top.
INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY He checks the passport and finds CLIVE's absurd picture.
INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY He laughs.
PAUL Hallelujah.
MOSES BEHE Ruth, what in the Lord's name- MOSES and PAUL come face to face.
MOSES BEHE They regard each other for a second.
PAUL Boo?
EXT. RV PARK - DAY PAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES who is loading a shotgun.
The RV start to move forward.
The door swings open and GRAHAM appears, beckoning to PAUL.
PAUL reaches the door, just as MOSES levels the gun at his target.
PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a booming shot.
The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the RV careens off out of the trailer park.
INT. RV - DAY Blackness.
INT. RV - DAY RUTH wakes up.
INT. RV - DAY Panic in her eyes.
INT. RV - DAY CLIVE drives, GRAHAM sits on the sofa, biting his nails.
GRAHAM Hi.
RUTH Where am I?
RUTH PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile.
PAUL Hey, look who's up.
GRAHAM Would you like a cup of tea?
GRAHAM RUTH starts to pray furiously.
GRAHAM I'm so sorry it had to be this way Ruth.
GRAHAM We're definitely not going to hurt you and we'll let you go as son as we can.
GRAHAM We were just a little concerned that you might call the police.
RUTH You have been deceived.
RUTH Deceived by an agent of Satan himself.
PAUL You know I'm sitting right here?
GRAHAM He's not a demon Ruth, he's from another world and we're helping him get home.
GRAHAM He's not evil.
GRAHAM He's just very rude.
RUTH How can he be from another world?
RUTH There is only one world.
RUTH Our world, created by God the Father.
RUTH PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM.
RUTH RUTH whimpers.
PAUL Look, if it makes you feel any better, my existence only disproves the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo- Christian God, as well as all single earth theologies.
PAUL Science still hasn't categorically rule out the notion of divinity, even though evolutionary biology suggest the non-existence of a creator by probability alone.
RUTH How could that possibly make me feel any better?
PAUL Jesus Christ, I was just trying to be nice!
GRAHAM I think what Paul's trying to say is, just because there are other inhabited planets, it's not the end of the world.
RUTH This isn't happening!
RUTH You're a hallucination.
RUTH You're not real.
RUTH You're a test.
RUTH A test from God.
PAUL You can't win can you?
PAUL RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an awful noise.
CLIVE I can't drive like this.
CLIVE We'll have to drop her off and take our chances.
GRAHAM No!
PAUL Oh, for God's sake.
PAUL PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her forehead.
PAUL He appear to go into a trance.
PAUL RUTH's eyes roll up into her head.
PAUL We see a lightening montage of images.
PAUL The cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's ship crashing into the ground.
PAUL The images speed up as PAUL telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind.
PAUL They collapse in a heap on the floor.
PAUL PAUL sparks up a cigarette.
GRAHAM What did you do to her?!
PAUL I broadened her horizons.
GRAHAM Can you broaden mine?
PAUL No, it's tiring.
PAUL GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.
GRAHAM Oh please.
PAUL Come here then.
PAUL PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head.
PAUL GRAHAM's eyes go all fluttery.
PAUL We don't see the images this time.
PAUL GRAHAM falls.
CLIVE Oh great!
CLIVE Everyone knows the secrets of the universe apart from me.
CLIVE He always knew what was going on in Buffy before me because his mum had cable.
PAUL Can't I just tell you?
CLIVE No spoilers!
CLIVE PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps CLIVE who falls to the floor.
CLIVE Everyone lays inert.
Maybe I should make that tea?
EXT. RV PARK - DAY THREE BLACK SEDANS are parked in the BEHE RV park.
MOSES BEHE I didn't call the government.
MOSES BEHE I called the po-lice.
ZOIL Given your description of the intruder, the police felt your call was perhaps better directed to us.
MOSES BEHE And who are you?
ZOIL Secret Service, sir.
MOSES BEHE I knew it.
MOSES BEHE You know that devil took my Ruth.
ZOIL And Ruth's your daughter?
MOSES BEHE That's right.
MOSES BEHE Her Mama died when she was born.
MOSES BEHE I good as brought her up by myself.
MOSES BEHE Wasn't easy either.
MOSES BEHE Two mouths to feed and this place to run.
ZOIL I understand.
ZOIL Do you have a photography of Ruth, Mr. Behe?
ZOIL MOSES retrieves an old cigar box and produces a tattered photograph of Ruth.
ZOIL She appears younger, with both eyes intact and with dark hair.
ZOIL She's pretty.
ZOIL MOSES snorts.
ZOIL Do you have a phone Mr. Behe?
ZOIL In case she tries to contact you.
MOSES BEHE I do...
MOSES BEHE ZOIL nods at HAGGARD who immediately starts dialling on his satellite phone, moving into a different room.
MOSES BEHE ...and she'll call me if she can.
MOSES BEHE Ruth's never really been outta Carbon County.
ZOIL You say they went East?
MOSES BEHE Uh-huh.
MOSES BEHE They'll have to get off the 191 after Flaming Gorge if they ain't using the interstate, there's been a rig spill just South of Dutch John.
ZOIL So?
MOSES BEHE So that means they'll be on the 44.
MOSES BEHE Only way to go.
MOSES BEHE ZOIL looks at O'REILLY.
ZOIL Let's go.
ZOIL Haggard!
MOSES BEHE Tell me you're gonna kill that thing, Mr. Zoil.
MOSES BEHE Kill it for what it is.
ZOIL We'll do our best, Mr. Behe.
MOSES BEHE Watch yourself now.
MOSES BEHE I seen its eyes.
MOSES BEHE It's evil.
MOSES BEHE ZOIL, HAGGARD and O'REILLY leave.
MOSES BEHE MOSES watches them.
MOSES BEHE God's speed, Mr. Zoil.
EXT. RV PARK - DAY ZOIL's radio crackles to life.
HAGGARD Man, that way was one fat freak!
O'REILLY If I was that girl, I think I'd rather take my chances with the alien.
O'REILLY HAGGARD and O'REILLY hoot with laughter.
ZOIL Can it, you two!
ZOIL How many times do I have to tell you?
INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY MOSES is sat at his kitchen table listening to his police scanner.
INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY HAGGARD and O'REILLY's laughter rattles loudly over the radio.
ZOIL We do not refer to the target as "?The Alien'.
ZOIL MOSES's expression is mixture of fury and disbelief.
ZOIL He glances at something nearby.
ZOIL Pull focus to the shotgun, lying in the foreground on the kitchen table.
ZOIL We hear an engine splutter into life, revving furiously.
MOSES in his pick up truck, screams off in pursuit.
INT. RV - DAY CLOSE on PAUL.
INT. RV - DAY He is staring at something in wonder.
PAUL Wow.
PAUL Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE, looking out through the RV's windshield.
PAUL We see their POV.
PAUL A breathtaking panorama of natural beauty.
PAUL They are parked up at the summit of a mountain road, looking out across the vista.
PAUL There it is, boys.
PAUL Wyoming.
CLIVE Is that where we're going?
PAUL Maybe.
PAUL I gotta tell ya.
PAUL It's at times like these you winder if the intelligent design crowd aren't onto something.
PAUL I mean look at it.
PAUL Hey Ruth, get up here.
PAUL They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone.
PAUL Ruth!?
CLIVE Someone should go after her.
CLIVE Graham?
CLIVE CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone.
CLIVE Graham!?
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY RUTH is storming up the road.
GRAHAM Ruth!
RUTH Leave me alone!
GRAHAM Ruth, please stop, I've got shin splints.
GRAHAM RUTH stops.
GRAHAM GRAHAM catches up to her.
GRAHAM Are you alright?
RUTH He can't be from space.
RUTH It's not possible.
GRAHAM Ruth, you saw for yourself.
GRAHAM It's not just possible, it's probably.
GRAHAM There's probably millions of intelligent civilizations.
RUTH So, where is everybody?
GRAHAM Well, one of them is right there.
GRAHAM RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV.
GRAHAM PAUL is stood on the dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window.
GRAHAM CLIVE is trying not to laugh.
RUTH Everything I've ever been told is a lie.
RUTH My purpose.
RUTH My truth.
RUTH All false.
RUTH DO you know how that feels?
RUTH To suddenly have nothing?
GRAHAM Just because your truth wasn't the truth, it doesn't mean there is no truth, Ruth.
RUTH Huh?
GRAHAM I understand you're probably feeling very confused right now.
GRAHAM Religious belief systems are devised to give us context and security.
GRAHAM To stop us feeling lonely and unimportant.
RUTH I do feel lonely and unimportant!
RUTH How can this all be an accident?
RUTH It doesn't make sense.
RUTH Did you know the reason we have solar eclipses is because the sun is exactly 400 times bigger than the moon and the moon is exactly 400 times closer to the earth?
RUTH GRAHAM considers saying "?yes' but decides against it.
RUTH How can that be an accident.
GRAHAM It isn't, it's a coincidence.
GRAHAM Or it probably is.
GRAHAM That's the beauty of the universe.
RUTH But what's the point?
RUTH If there's nothing afterwards, what's the point in living?
GRAHAM This is the point, Ruth.
GRAHAM Right now.
GRAHAM This conversation.
GRAHAM That tree, your next cheeseburger.
GRAHAM Life is a miracle.
GRAHAM People spend so much time focusing on rescuing the princess, they forget how much fun it is to fight the dragon.
RUTH Huh?
GRAHAM Carl Sagan said "?A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.'
RUTH Huh?
GRAHAM It's okay not to know, Ruth.
GRAHAM It's wonderful because it means we still have things to learn.
GRAHAM We still have life to live.
RUTH I'm frightened.
GRAHAM So am I, but it passes, sort of.
GRAHAM Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure and I think you should come with us.
GRAHAM I know you feel confused and lost but if you get back on board that RV, you might just find the very thing you're looking for.
RUTH I...
RUTH I'm not sure.
GRAHAM I'm sure Ruth.
GRAHAM I'm sure because I can honestly say, I have never talked to a woman for this long without blushing.
RUTH That's so sweet.
RUTH GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red.
INT. RV - DAY GRAHAM and RUTH get back onto the RV.
INT. RV - DAY GRAHAM looks pleased with himself.

leaps back and forth over the line.
PAUL 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock.
PAUL Come on!
PAUL It's fun.

PAUL Hey, we should stop for something to eat.
PAUL Are you hungry, Ruth?
RUTH What?
CLIVE I'm hungry.
PAUL What's new, fatty?
CLIVE Hey, it's not fat, it's power.
CLIVE I happen to be very strong.
CLIVE PAUL summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits it onto the floor of the RV.
PAUL Pick that up then.
CLIVE So childish.
RUTH Maybe I should call Papa.
What?!
RUTH Look, I've been missing for a whole day.
RUTH If he's called the police, they'll be looking for us and if they find us, this "?amazing adventure' is going to come to an end real quick.
RUTH I just need to tell him I'm fine and that I'll be back soon, okay?
RUTH PAUL offers up a high five to RUTH.
PAUL Right up top!
PAUL RUTH yelps, terrified that PAUL is going to zap her again.
PAUL Too soon?
PAUL CLIVE reaches down and picks up PAUL's phlegm ball.
CLIVE I did it!
EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT GRAHAM, CLIVE and RUTH step out of the RV.
CLIVE Okay, in and out, yes?
CLIVE Don't talk to anyone unless you have to and try to look inconspicuous.
CLIVE Angle on the most conspicuous threesome in America.

CLIVE They enter the bar.
CLIVE Parked nearby, is a black Lincoln Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.

RUTH I don't know how I feel about him.
RUTH He's weird and also, rude.
ZOIL Yes he is.

JAKE Hey, slow down there cyclops.
RUTH I need to get to my friends.
GUS Why the hurry?
GUS You know I got a friend with one eye who'd love to meet you.
RUTH I happen to have two eyes actually.
RUTH I just have a severe stigmatism.
JAKE You should get that fixed up.
JAKE Reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the right light.
GUS Yeah, the dark.
RUTH Papa said the Lord would fix it.
GUS The Lord ain't gonna fix nothing sweetheart.

They sit round drinking beers and chatting.
PAUL rolls a joint.
GRAHAM So why "?Paul'?
GRAHAM It's not very, you know, alien.
CLIVE Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or something?
PAUL No.
GRAHAM P-o-o-u-r-l?
PAUL No, it's Paul.
PAUL Like Paul Newman or the little guy from Simon and Garfunkel.
CLIVE Paul Simon.
PAUL Paul Simon.
PAUL Paul's not my real name.
PAUL It's a name I got given.
GRAHAM What's your real name?
PAUL You won't be able to pronounce it.
CLIVE I can speak Klingon.
PAUL What a geek.
CLIVE Hey!
GRAHAM Come on, what's your real name.
GRAHAM PAUL opens his mouth and screeches.
PAUL Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.
CLIVE Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa.
PAUL That's pretty good.
GRAHAM Rootchaa?
GRAHAM That sounds like Roger.
PAUL Fuck you!
CLIVE Calm down, Rog.
CLIVE More laughter.
CLIVE Even PAUL.
CLIVE He lights his joint.
GRAHAM You look like a poster on a student's wall.
PAUL That was my gag!
PAUL "?Take me to your dealer' right?
PAUL Yeah, that was mine.
PAUL Never saw a dime.
GRAHAM You never answered my question.
GRAHAM Why Paul?
GRAHAM Who called you Paul?
PAUL The little girl who found me when I crashed.
PAUL It was terrible actually.
PAUL I killed her dog.
PAUL I didn't mean to!
PAUL My ship sort of landed on it.
PAUL When the military arrived I was delirious; I kept saying "Paul?
PAUL Paul?"? It was the only English I knew, because I'd heard the little girl saying it over and over.
PAUL Spooks thought it was my name.
CLIVE She called her dog Paul?
PAUL Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles.
GRAHAM What happened to the little girl?
PAUL Who knows?
PAUL Never saw her again.
PAUL Think about her everyday though.
PAUL PAUL offers the joint round.
PAUL CLIVE and GRAHAM decline.
PAUL PAUL takes a deep drag.
PAUL During the following exchange, GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though governed by some kind of psychic link.
CLIVE It's strange, isn't it?
CLIVE Ordinarily in this situation Graham and I would be looking up at the stars, wondering about life on other planets but we know now, don't we?
CLIVE It's a bit of an anti-climax.
PAUL Thanks a bunch, Hurley.
CLIVE I don't mean that in a bad way.
CLIVE They all scratch their noses.
GRAHAM Paul, can I ask you something?
PAUL Shoot.
GRAHAM Why are you in such a hurry to leave?
PAUL I've outlived my usefulness.
CLIVE How so?
PAUL There's only so much knowledge I can share about the universe and quantum theory and how to make a really nice meatball sandwich.
PAUL The only thing I have to offer them now are my abilities.
GRAHAM So?
PAUL So the only way they're going to get hold of them is by obtaining some of somatic stem cells.
GRAHAM So what, do they take a swab from your cheek?
PAUL Negative.
CLIVE Stool?
PAUL Sadly, not that simple.
GRAHAM Blood?!
GRAHAM Oh my god, I hate needles.
PAUL Believe me, a needle would be a picnic compared to what they had in store for me.
CLIVE I don't follow.
PAUL Stem cells are multipotent.
PAUL GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.
PAUL Lineage defined?
PAUL GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.
PAUL (CONT'D) The camouflage response, the memory transfer, the revivification, they all originate in my cerebellum.
PAUL (CONT'D) In order to cultivate them in a laboratory they would have to...
GRAHAM/CLIVE Cut your brain out.
PAUL Bingo!
PAUL Fortunately, someone was kind enough to give me the heads up, if you'll pardon the pun.
PAUL So, when they were transferring me to the medical facility and I noticed the bumper sticker on your RV, I figured you might be sympathetic types.
PAUL I zapped the spooks, grabbed the wheel and took my chance.
CLIVE I thought the crash was our fault.
PAUL Well it was, kinda.
GRAHAM So, you're saying if they catch you...
GRAHAM PAUL draws his thumb across his neck.
GRAHAM GRAHAM and CLIVE look at PAUL in horror.
GRAHAM All three scratch their heads.
PAUL So tell me, are you guys virgins or what?
GRAHAM/CLIVE No.
GRAHAM/CLIVE They all cough.
PAUL Alright then, Clive, when was the last time you got laid.
CLIVE Comic-Con 2005.
CLIVE Ewok chick.
PAUL Three years ago you had sex with a midget?
CLIVE She was an Ewok!
CLIVE Sniff.
PAUL There are only two types of person small enough to fit inside an Ewok costume.
CLIVE She was a midget.
PAUL I can't believe you thought boning a space bear sounded less embarrassing than a person of short stature.
CLIVE I know.
CLIVE I'm sorry.
PAUL Was it nice?
PAUL You sly dog!
PAUL PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping.
PAUL GRAHAM snorts into his beer, laughing.
PAUL CLIVE joins in.
PAUL Before long, the three friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of control.
PAUL After about thirty seconds of this, they pass out.
The sun has just risen.
GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL lie round the smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly.
PAUL is very white.
His eyes open.
He looks around.
PAUL Oh shit!
PAUL Hey, wake up.
PAUL Wake up.
PAUL We fell asleep.
CLIVE How did that happen?
PAUL Sorry, I get this thing when I get high.
PAUL It's called "?projective empathy'.
PAUL You feel what I feel.
GRAHAM Like in E.T.?
PAUL Exactly.
CLIVE Oh, thank God.
CLIVE For a second there I thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer.
CLIVE The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood.
CLIVE Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet town of last night has become very busy indeed.
GRAHAM Oh dear!
PAUL I can't walk through there.
CLIVE How are we going to get back?
CLIVE Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life.
GRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them is PAUL.
He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face.
GRAHAM Maybe we should hold hands, so that we look like a family.
PAUL That's great!
PAUL Two grown men who look like sex offenders holding hands with a child cowboy.
CLIVE You could be a midget.
PAUL You're obsessed with midgets!
PAUL They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange.
GRAHAM Seem to be working, Clive.
GRAHAM Clive?
GRAHAM GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them.
GRAHAM He looks back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con.
GRAHAM The tag reads "?Genuine "?BLADE' Katana'.
GRAHAM $299.99.
GRAHAM Clive, no.
GRAHAM CLIVE walks into the shop.
GRAHAM GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly behind.
GRAHAM As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from the adjacent Drug Store.
GRAHAM He takes a couple of pain killers and flexes his sore shoulders.
GRAHAM He wanders up the road, scanning the passers by.
GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who is at the counter.
GRAHAM Now's not really the time, Sausage.
CLIVE I must have it.
GRAHAM It's very cheap.
GRAHAM Are you sure you don't want to save up and get a proper on?
CLIVE Oh, come on, we've got time.
INT/EXT. RV - DAY Close on RUTH's watch.
INT/EXT. RV - DAY She paces, worried.
RUTH Where have you been?
RUTH I was worried.
RUTH She opens the door.
RUTH AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge.
ZOIL Good morning, Ma'am.
ZOIL Sorry to trouble you.
ZOIL Agent Zoil, Secret Service.
ZOIL Your wagon here matches the description of a recreational vehicle we're currently looking for.
ZOIL May I ask, are you alone?
ZOIL RUTH pauses a second.
RUTH Yes, I'm alone.
ZOIL Do you mind taking a look at these pictures?
ZOIL ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH.
ZOIL CCTV shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses.
ZOIL Do you recognise any of these people, Miss?
ZOIL She lingers on the picture of herself.
ZOIL Miss?
RUTH No, sorry I don't.
ZOIL Where are you coming from, Ma'am?
RUTH Christian ministry in Seattle.
RUTH I've been driving for 5 days.
ZOIL Going far?
RUTH Austin.
ZOIL Great town.
RUTH Oh yes.
RUTH It has an impressive bat population you know?
Folks gather by the rive in the evening to watch them fly out.
Turn the sky black.
Quite a sight.
ZOIL Is that so?
RUTH Uh-huh.
RUTH Well, I really should be getting along.
ZOIL Of course.
ZOIL Thanks for your time, Miss...?
ZOIL Beat.
RUTH Darwin, Charlotte Darwin.
RUTH ZOIL smiles and nods.
RUTH He laves.
GRAHAM and CLIVE are at the counter.
CLIVE is trying out the blade.
PAUL, in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics.
He picks one up.
The cover features an alien that looks a lot like him.
The comic is called "?Encounter Briefs: Tales From the Dreamland'.
PAUL smiles and shakes his head.
He suddenly realises he is being watched.
Next to him is a child, (8) small enough to see under PAUL's hat.
He is looking at the cover of the comic and back at PAUL.
PAUL How's it going?
CHILD Is that you?
PAUL No.
CHILD It looks like you.
PAUL Suppose it does.
PAUL What's your name?
CHILD Keith Nash.
PAUL I'm Paul.
PAUL Pleased to meet you.
PAUL They shake hands.
PAUL You on your own here, Keith Nash?
KEITH NASH My Mom's shopping for some new jeans.
KEITH NASH She lets me wait in here.
PAUL Sounds like a good Mum.
KEITH NASH Yes and no.
KEITH NASH What're you doing here?
PAUL My friend's buying a sword.
PAUL He's a grown man.
KEITH NASH What a nerd.
KEITH NASH PAUL laughs.
KEITH NASH So does KEITH NASH.
PAUL You an M&Ms man, Keith?
PAUL PAUL produces his M&Ms.
PAUL He offers one to KEITH.
KEITH NASH I am but I shouldn't.
PAUL Strangers with candy, right?
KEITH NASH Right.
PAUL Well, we've got a lot in common.
PAUL We both like comics and M&Ms.
PAUL Guess that makes us pals.
KEITH NASH Guess so.
KEITH NASH KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&Ms.
KEITH NASH They turn their attention back to the racks of comics.
KEITH NASH PAUL pulls one out called "?G-Men'.
KEITH NASH On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike ZOIL, shooting an alien not unlike PAUL.
PAUL You read this one?
KEITH NASH No.
PAUL It's a good one.
PAUL Take it.
PAUL Go on.
PAUL It's a gift.
KEITH NASH Thanks Paul.
KEITH stuffs it down his trousers.
PAUL laughs.
We hear MRS.
NASH calling from the street.
KEITH NASH I gotta go.
PAUL Catch you later, Keith Nash.
PAUL GRAHAM and CLIVE approach.
PAUL CLIVE has a long sword shaped box under his arm and a big grin on his face.
CLIVE Who was that?
PAUL Keith Nash.
PAUL How much was that?
CLIVE $299.99.
CLIVE It's made of a low grade Turkish alloy.
PAUL What did you get, speccy?
GRAHAM X-Men action figure.
PAUL Jesus Cheeeerist.
GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL exit the comic shop.
PAUL waves to KEITH NASH, who now sits outside, on a bench, with his MOTHER.
The boys walk up the street, seconds later, HAGGARD and O'REILLY step out of a store, eating bags of candy.
MRS. NASH Don't lie, Keith.
KEITH NASH I'm not lying.
MRS. NASH Oh, come on now, Keith.
MRS. NASH If you carry on like this, you'll have to come with me to Dress Barn.
KEITH NASH Honestly Mommy, he was an alien and his name was Paul!
MRS. NASH Whoever hard of an alien called Paul?
HAGGARD is suddenly kneeling at KEITH NASH's side.
O'REILLY stands nearby.
HAGGARD What did you say, kid?
MRS. NASH Excuse me.
MRS. NASH Who are you?
HAGGARD Agent Haggard Ma'am, Secret Service.
MRS. NASH Secret Service?!
HAGGARD Kid?
KEITH NASH He was in the shop.
HAGGARD Is he still in there?
HAGGARD KEITH shakes his head.
O'REILLY Did he say where he was going?
O'REILLY KEITH looks at his comic.
O'REILLY The ZOIL style agent, shooting the PAUL style alien.
O'REILLY He looks back at HAGGARD and points him in the entirely wrong direction.
HAGGARD South.
HAGGARD Toward New Mexico, huh?
HAGGARD KEITH nods.
HAGGARD HAGGARD stands, his mind racing.
HAGGARD He looks meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the street behind him with CLIVE at the wheel.
O'REILLY We've got him man!
O'REILLY We're going to get a fucking promotion.
HAGGARD You did good kid.
HAGGARD Want a candy?
KEITH NASH No thanks.
HAGGARD Let's go.
HAGGARD The two agents rush off.
O'REILLY What about Zoil?
HAGGARD Screw Zoil!
MOSES BEHE kicks at the remains of the campfire.
He bends down and picks something up.
It is Ruth's handkerchief, now stained with dirt and blood.
He screws it into his shaking hand.
An engine roars.
He looks up to see the RV rumbling up the road.
It turns onto the Eastbound Highway.
MOSES' pick up is parked about 200 yards away.
MOSES starts to lumber towards it as fast as he can, which isn't very fast.
HAGGARD and O'REILLY sprint up to their vehicles.
ZOIL Where the hell do you think you're going?
ZOIL HAGGARD can't hide his frustration.
HAGGARD We picked up a lead, sir.
HAGGARD Little kid in the town said he saw an alien.
HAGGARD Said he was heading toward New Mexico.
ZOIL And you were just gonna take off?
HAGGARD Thought it best to take the initiative, sir.
HAGGARD We were going to radio you.
ZOIL Well now, that's mighty civil of you.
ZOIL We have a chain of command.
ZOIL I expect you to abide by it.
ZOIL Where d'you say he was headed?
HAGGARD New Mexico sir.
ZOIL Well, then let's move it.
ZOIL They scramble.
ZOIL Oh, and Haggard?
ZOIL Don't go getting ideas about your station again.
ZOIL ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed.
MOSES drives, Ruth's bloody handkerchief gripped between his hands and the wheel.
He listens to his police scanner.
VOICE Zoil, what the hell's going on?
ZOIL They've double back sir.
ZOIL They're heading toward New Mexico.
VOICE You better be right about this, Zoil.
VOICE I'm getting a little tired of this shit.
VOICE I want that little fucker's brain in a jar by sundown.
VOICE MOSES smiles darkly.
MOSES BEHE Looks like you're going the wrong way, Agent Zoil.
MOSES BEHE That's what happens when you don't got the Lord on your side.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY MOSES BEHE's pick up roars through shot, revealing a large roadside sign proclaiming LUCIFER'S CUT PRICE FIREWORK WAREHOUSE.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY Creep in on the sign.
INT. RV - DAYBREAK The RV is parked outside the firework warehouse.

PAUL He likes you, y'know?
RUTH Graham?
RUTH D'you think?
PAUL What are you, blind?
PAUL Beat.
PAUL (CONT'D) Sorry.
PAUL (CONT'D) Beat.
PAUL What you got there, a stigmatism?
RUTH nods.
PAUL You know you can get on operation for that, right?
RUTH Papa said the Lord would fix it.
RUTH Guess that's not gonna happen, seeing as we're living in a gigantic godless universe, with no hope of salvation.
PAUL Hey, I don't know categorically that it's godless.
PAUL I just said "?probably'.
RUTH Oh, that's a relief.
PAUL Look, the way you're feeling now, that's why religion appeared in the first place.
PAUL It's like existential Prozac.
PAUL Imagine being five year sold and having no adults around to tell you why it snows or what trees are for.
PAUL That's how it is for much of humanity.
PAUL Faith is a night- light.
PAUL It illuminates the scary corners, fills the gaps, makes the universe easier to comprehend.
PAUL Thing is, it's okay not to know everything.
PAUL I mean, who knows what's really out there?
PAUL Did you know astrophysicists recently identified the equation for the creation of matter?
RUTH Yes.
PAUL Oh.
PAUL Well, then you get it, right?
PAUL If they have the theory, who's to say at some point in the future they won't put it into practice and who's to say someone else didn't do that 13.5 Billion years ago and that's how the universe came to be?
PAUL Course, then we get the eternal problem of who created the creator but that's a whole other car park.
PAUL I think Shakespeare said it best.
PAUL "There's more in Heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy Horatio"?.
RUTH What did you call me?
PAUL Horatio.
PAUL It's from Hamlet.
PAUL You know, the Prince of Denmark?
RUTH Denmark has a municipal population of 508,691.
RUTH PAUL blinks.
PAUL Anyway, if there is a God, didn't he create doctors and hospitals and scalpels and shit, so he wouldn't have to go round fixing people's lazy eyeballs?
RUTH I suppose so.
PAUL The eye is a delicate and complex thing, Ruth.
PAUL You should get it taken care of.
PAUL RUTH smiles.
PAUL PAUL smiles back.
PAUL RUTH looks out of the window, just as PAUL reaches out to touch her face.
RUTH They're back.
RUTH PAUL withdraws his hand.
RUTH GRAHAM and CLIVE are approaching the RV clutching a large firework.
RUTH They climb aboard.
PAUL Perfect.
CLIVE What are you going to do with this?
PAUL Phone home.
ZOIL jumps but gathers his composure quickly.
ZOIL Yes, sir?
VOICE Satellite's come up with a data analysis on all the traffic coming out of Prospect in the last 5 hours.
VOICE There was only one RV, and guess what, nimrod?
ZOIL It wasn't going to New Mexico?
VOICE That's a three pointer Agent Zoil.
VOICE You better spin your ass around.
VOICE You got some serious catching up to do.
VOICE Don't make me come out there.
ZOIL No, sir.
ZOIL Where are they headed?
ZOIL If we gun it, maybe we can get the drop on their destination.
VOICE They're on the 50, heading towards Gillette.
ZOIL What else is around there?
VOICE Not much.
VOICE Thunder Basis, Bethlehem Creek.
ZOIL Bethlehem Creek?
VOICE Holy shit!
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY ZOIL's motorcade pulls a spectacular U-turn and heads back up the highway in the opposite direction.
MOSES listens intently to his scanner.
VOICE You don't think she's sill there, do you?
VOICE MOSES smiles.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY MOSES BEHE's pick-up truck pulls a similarly spectacular turn and heads in a different direction.
Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL stare through the window of the RV at the farmhouse glimpsed in the first scene.
GRAHAM You don't think she's still there do you?
PAUL That's what you're going to find out for me.
CLIVE Us?
PAUL I can't just knock can I?
PAUL What if she's moved on and someone else answers?
PAUL I'm sick of people fainting on me.
PAUL I'll hang back with my buddy Ruth, you two make first contact.
PAUL Just enjoy it.
CLIVE What shall we say if it's her?
CLIVE We're here with the alien that killed your dog sixty years ago?
PAUL Yes.
PAUL Hurry up, there's going to be a really big storm in exactly 34 minutes.
RUTH How do you know?
PAUL It's my job to know.

CLIVE The sound of multiple locks.
CLIVE The door opens to reveal a woman (68).
CLIVE Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her eyes.
CLIVE She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE.
TARA What is this, some kind of joke?
CLIVE It's no joke.
CLIVE PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE.

TARA Where are my manners?
TARA I never really have guests.
TARA Nobody comes up here.
TARA I go whole weeks without seeing a soul.
TARA goes to the kitchen.
She can be seen from where they are sitting.
She turns the gas on and strikes a cooking match.
PAUL looks pained, struggling for something to say.
PAUL Can I do anything to help?
PAUL TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand.
PAUL PAUL stands and walks toward her, she watches him.
TARA I've only just stopped believing in you, y'know?
TARA Spent a very long time trying to convince folk about what happened that night.
TARA My parents, my friends.
TARA Everyone thought I was mad.
TARA They told me it was a meteor that squashed little Paul.
TARA Took me away and did tests they did, said it was for cosmic radiation.
TARA They said I was concussed, hallucinating, but I knew you were real.
TARA I pulled you from that spaceship myself.
TARA Sat with you till the men came and took you away.
TARA If Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he would have seen you too.
TARA They kept telling me I'd imagined it but I knew different.
TARA Pop tried to understand but they filled his head with "?delayed this' and "?post- traumatic that'.
TARA He just used to smile and say "?there, there Tara'.
TARA He got sick when I was seventeen and died a few years later.
TARA I inherited this place.
TARA Word got out about my story not long after it happened, so I didn't really have any friends.
TARA Kids used to throw stones at the house and call me names.
TARA I just kinda retreated into myself.
TARA I'd spend whole nights up on the roof, staring at the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of you again.
TARA I always believed that one day you"?d come back and here you are.
TARA The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out.
TARA Listen to me gabbing.
TARA Milk and sugar?
PAUL I'm so sorry.
TARA What for?
PAUL For killing your dog and ruining your life.
TARA That doesn't matter.
TARA Don't you see?
TARA You're real.
TARA I was right and all those folk that said I was crazy?
TARA Well, they can all go fuck themselves.
PAUL It's good to see you, Tara.
PAUL The tinkle of glass.
PAUL Something hits the floor.
PAUL A tear gas canister spins at their feet, spewing thick fog.
TARA Now, where do you suppose that came from?
PAUL Fuck a duck!
