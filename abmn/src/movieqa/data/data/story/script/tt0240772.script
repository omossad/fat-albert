LATE PRODUCTION DRAFT 05/31/01 (Buff)
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01
We hear a DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, followed by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.
DANNY OCEAN, dressed in prison fatigues, ENTERS FRAME and sits.
VOICE Good morning.
DANNY Good morning.
VOICE Please state your name for the record.
DANNY Daniel Ocean.
VOICE Thank you.
VOICE Mr. Ocean, the purpose of this meeting is to determine whether, if released, you are likely to break the law again.
VOICE While this was your first conviction, you have been implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds.
VOICE What can you tell us about this?
DANNY As you say, ma'am, I was never charged.
Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a table.
BOARD MEMBER #2 Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to find out is: was there a reason you chose to commit this crime, or was there a reason why you simply got caught this time?
DANNY My wife left me.
DANNY I was upset.
DANNY I got into a self-destructive pattern.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 2.
BOARD MEMBER #3 If released, is it likely you would fall back into a similar pattern?
DANNY She already left me once.
DANNY I don't think she'll do it again just for kicks.
Glances dart between the Board Members.
BOARD MEMBER #1 Mr. Ocean, what do you think you would do if released?
Danny considers.
DANNY I don't know.
DANNY How much do you guys make a year?
GUARD #2 Ocean, Daniel.
Danny steps forth, and GUARD #1 doles out his possessions and a form certifying their return to Danny.
GUARD #2 Sign.
GUARD #2 This came today for you.
GUARD #2 Rest'll be forwarded to your parole officer.
GUARD #1 Those your lawyers?
DANNY My wife's.
He opens the letter, and as his eyes gaze over the papers within, he smirks just a little.
GUARD #1 What's it say?
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 3.
DANNY I'm a free man.
Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare thread among them.
He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The old skin feels good.
One last item to don: a silver wedding band.
Danny considers it.
Will he put it on?
A sign reads: "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY."
Someone has graffitied below it: "If you were in prison, you'd be home now."
The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its frame, ready for release.
(If it matters -- and if you notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)
He hovers there for a moment, on the precipice of freedom.
The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of the gate, and the view ahead is not pleasant (New Jersey): Life is hard out there.
But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step into free America...
Any empty wintery boardwalk.
...
And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red carpeting.
As we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS.
And to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair and a snifter of brandy.
He's home.
As he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of chips.
Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but without success.
He turns his attention back to his cards, and the cards of the dealer.
Nine-ten.
Stay.
Dealer -- seventeen.
Danny wins.
King-four.
Dealer shows a six.
Stick.
Dealer busts.
Queen-ace.
Twenty-one.
Danny wins again.
A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar face is welcome.
DANNY Hello, Frank.
The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself.
He quickly hides his astonishment.
FRANK I beg your pardon, sir.
FRANK You must have me confused with someone else.
FRANK My name is Ramon.
FRANK See?
He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen.
A pit boss circles close by and glares at them both.
DANNY My mistake...
DANNY Table's cold anyway.
FRANK You might try the lounge at the Grand, sir.
FRANK It gets busy around one.
DANNY Thanks.
Danny checks his watch -- 12:58 -- then the lounge around him: prison had more nightlife.
He nurses a bourbon, folds back the New York Times and scans.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 5.
His eyes move down the page and stop at a header -- "Vegas' Paradiso to be Razed; Former Owner Denounces Plans" -- accompanied by two photographs...
The first: Tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of the Paradiso, Terry Benedict, with a beautiful (if barely visible) woman on his arm.
The second: scowling former owner, Reuben Tishkoff.
FRANK Catching up on current events?
Danny lowers the paper; Frank is sitting across from him, changed out of his dealer's threads.
DANNY Ramon?
FRANK Glad to meet you.
FRANK Frank Catton wouldn't get by the gaming board.
FRANK You just out?
DANNY This afternoon.
FRANK And already turning over a new leaf.
Frank signals a passing waitress; she ignores him.
DANNY You seen him?
FRANK Last I heard he was in L.A.
FRANK Teaching movie stars how to play cards.
FRANK Why?
FRANK You don't have something planned already?
DANNY You kidding?
DANNY I just became a citizen again.
Frank stares at Danny a moment, finally catches his eye, and Danny can't help but grin: of course he has.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 6.
Frank turns his eyes to heaven...
FRANK Jesus...
MOVING WITH Danny and Frank.
FRANK It's tough now, our line of work.
FRANK Everybody so serious.
FRANK Too many guns, too many computers.
FRANK Whadda you gonna do?
FRANK Steal from ordinary people?
DANNY That would be criminal.
FRANK So what's left?
FRANK Banks?
FRANK Hah.
FRANK Banks got no money.
FRANK It's all electronic.
FRANK Only place that still takes cash is...
DANNY Casinos.
FRANK Oh, no...
DANNY Oh, yes...
FRANK When?
DANNY Soon.
DANNY Interested?
Frank smiles.
Danny has his answer.
Danny pulls a business card from his jacket, picks up the phone again, and dials the card's number.
DANNY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
DANNY 5/31/01 7.
DANNY Yes, Officer Brooks?
DANNY My name is Danny Ocean.
DANNY I'm just out, I'm supposed to check in with you within twenty-four hours.
DANNY No, sir, I haven't gotten into any trouble.
DANNY No drinking, no sir.
DANNY No, sir, I wouldn't even think of leaving the state.
DANNY OFF the sound of a JET fly-over we...
PULLING OFF the Capitol Building, we PICK UP Rusty (tall, angular, ebony) leaning against his Ford Falcon.
TOPHER Hey!
TOPHER Hey, Rusty!
TOPHER Rusty turns to the voice and --
ANOTHER ANGLE MOVING WITH him and Topher Grace, the actor, as they push down a back alley.
TOPHER Hey, I don't know if you're, uh, you know, incorporated or anything, like Rusty Ryan.
TOPHER And, I don't know, incorporated, but you should think about it, really, 'cause I was talking to my manager yesterday --
RUSTY Bernie?
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 5/31/01 8.
TOPHER No, not Bernie, I mean not, not that Bernie, my business manager, he's also Bernie, he was telling me that since this, what we do, could be considered research for, you know, a future gig, that I should be able to write it off as a business expense.
TOPHER So he suggested that it'd be better if I wrote you a check, and thereby --
TOPHER Rusty looks at him: are you stoned?
TOPHER Or, or we could keep it cash.
TOPHER By this time, they should have entered --
-- where they must weave through hordes of young Hollywood nightclubbers.
RUSTY Alright.
RUSTY Who's here?
TOPHER Josh is here.
TOPHER Seth is here.
TOPHER David couldn't make it.
TOPHER He's got two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania because somebody just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from Germany.
RUSTY That's a problem.
TOPHER Barry is here.
RUSTY I thought they let him out to do that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver.
TOPHER Couldn't work the dates.
TOPHER Oh, and he brought his girlfriend.
TOPHER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TOPHER 5/31/01 9.
RUSTY Not the one from --
TOPHER Uh-huh.
RUSTY I quit watching when Kate left Don after his accident.
RUSTY They pass on, and into --
Small but stylish.
Rusty enters, Topher in tow.
RUSTY Good evening, guys.
RUSTY Let's play some cards...
RUSTY A glance at the table reveals: the three waiting players are all young TV stars (Josh Jackson, Seth Green, Barry Watson) here for a group poker lesson with Rusty.
RUSTY (One star, indeed, has brought his girlfriend, Katie, also a known actress, to observe.)
RUSTY A glance back at Rusty reveals: he's in for a long night.
RUSTY ...
RUSTY and let's play some cards.
AT TABLE - LATER The group lesson has begun.
TOPHER A hundred bucks to me...
TOPHER Ah, what the hell.
TOPHER Pocket change.
TOPHER Call.
Rusty leans into Topher's ear, whispering:
TOPHER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TOPHER 5/31/01 10.
RUSTY Why you bet a certain way is your business.
RUSTY But you have to make them think you're betting for a reason.
RUSTY Understand?
To another player:
RUSTY Seth.
RUSTY You know what you have.
RUSTY Looking at them doesn't change them.
RUSTY Leave 'em where they are and make your bet.
To another player:
RUSTY You're showing.
RUSTY Yeah, I know she's your girlfriend, Barry, but you can't...
RUSTY Thank you.
To another:
RUSTY Josh.
RUSTY Deal to your left.
SAME SCENE - LATER A WAITRESS enters from the club, and DANCE MUSIC with
her.
As she distributes a fresh round:
WAITRESS One McCallum neat.
WAITRESS And four bottled waters.
WAITRESS Rusty takes in the sight -- bottled fucking water on a poker table.
SETH Two pair -- nines and twos.
SETH Rusty checks his hand: a full-house full of face cards.
SETH OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
SETH 5/31/01 11.
RUSTY You got me.
RUSTY Let's take a little break.
At the bar, Rusty orders a double.
He needs it.
BARTENDER How's the game going?!!
RUSTY It's been the longest hour of my life.
BARTENDER What?!
RUSTY I'm running away with your wife.
RUSTY The Bartender, not able to hear him, smiles and flashes a thumbs-up before moving away.
BARTENDER Cool, man!
BARTENDER Behind the bar two go-go dancers writhe behind red-light- district windows, and Rusty catches his own fatigued expression in their reflection.
BARTENDER Then, out the corner of his eye, he catches sight of a man passing through the pulsating crowd.
BARTENDER Someone familiar to him.
BARTENDER He follows.
Rusty returns.
TOPHER Hey, Rusty, we got another player, if that's alright.
TOPHER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TOPHER 5/31/01 12.
Topher indicates the new arrival: Danny.
Rusty looks as if there's a bad smell in the room.
RUSTY What's this?
DANNY The bouncer mentioned there was a game in progress.
DANNY I hope I'm not intruding.
TOPHER No intrusion at all --
RUSTY What was his name, the bouncer's?
DANNY I don't remember.
RUSTY A card player with amnesia.
RUSTY This should be fun.
AT TABLE - MOMENTS LATER Rusty deals the next hand.
TOPHER What do you do for a living, Mr. Ocean?
TOPHER If you don't mind my asking.
DANNY Why should I mind?
DANNY Two cards, please...
DANNY I just got out of prison.
TOPHER Really?
TOPHER Really...
RUSTY Barry, you're showing again.
BARRY Sorry.
BARRY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BARRY 5/31/01 12A.
JOSH What'd you, uh, go to prison for?
DANNY I stole things.
JOSH What, like jewels?
JOSH Diamonds?
A beat, then:
RUSTY Incan matrimonial headmasks.
RUSTY Looks are exchanged.
RUSTY Everyone digests that.
JOSH From a museum?
DANNY Gallery.
SETH There a lot of money in those?
SETH Incan matrimonial...
DANNY Headmasks.
DANNY Some.
RUSTY Don't let him fool you, Seth.
RUSTY There's boatloads.
RUSTY If you can move the things...
RUSTY One card to me.
RUSTY ...
RUSTY but you can't.
DANNY My fence seemed confident enough.
RUSTY If you're dealing with cash, you don't need a fence.
DANNY Some people just lack vision.
RUSTY Probably everybody in cell block E.
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 5/31/01 12B.
Now the other players realize.
These guys have a relationship.
In fact, a criminal one.
And, judging from their steely glares across the table, not a happy one.
DANNY Well, that's all behind us now.
RUSTY I should hope so.
RUSTY Danny smiles, icily -- of course, it's not -- then pulls out his wallet.
DANNY I raise you five hundred dollars.
DANNY A hush in the room.
DANNY Danny has thrown down the gauntlet.
DANNY He and Rusty hold each other's stares.
RUSTY Guys: Day One: what's the first rule of poker?
BARRY TOPHER Um, never bet on, uh, on 'Leave emotion at the a -- door.'
RUSTY That's right.
RUSTY My friend here just raised me out of pique.
RUSTY Today's lesson.
RUSTY How to draw out a bluff.
RUSTY This early in the game, that much money, I'm thinking he's holding nothing better than a pair of face cards.
RUSTY Seth, raise him.
SETH Okay.
SETH Uh, your five hundred and...
SETH another two?
SETH Rusty nods, and Seth pushes in his chips.
RUSTY Tophe...
TOPHER Seven to me.
TOPHER Plus three.
TOPHER What the hell.
TOPHER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TOPHER 5/31/01 12C.
RUSTY Indeed.
RUSTY But be careful you don't push him too high too fast.
RUSTY Want to keep him on the leash.
RUSTY I call.
RUSTY It's Josh's turn.
RUSTY He hesitates...
JOSH What's that to me?
JOSH A thousand?
RUSTY All you have to do is call.
DANNY What?
DANNY Your girlfriend holding your purse?
DANNY That does it.
DANNY Josh is in.
DANNY The bet's to Danny.
DANNY He checks his hand, and Seth starts to whisper to Topher.
DANNY Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say, Seth, I always check my cards before I make a bet.
DANNY But be cafeful.
DANNY I could tell from your face you're holding three of a kind or better.
DANNY Five hundred to call.
DANNY And two grand more.
DANNY Danny stares Rusty down.
DANNY The others look a little pale.
RUSTY Guys, you're free to do what you like.
RUSTY It's a lot of money.
RUSTY But I'm staying in.
RUSTY He's trying to buy his way out of his bluff.
RUSTY Nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to leave a grand on the table, either.
RUSTY Finally, Seth ponies up, and the others -- not be outdone -- do, too.
RUSTY We call.
RUSTY Danny sets down his hand.
RUSTY Four nines.
RUSTY It's a winner.
RUSTY The others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards.
RUSTY For the first time tonight, Rusty blanches.
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 5/31/01 12D.
RUSTY Shit.
RUSTY Sorry, guys.
RUSTY I -- I was sure he was bluffing.
RUSTY As Rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys around him, Danny rakes in his pot.
DANNY Thanks for the game, fellas.
DANNY Hey, I hate to ask this, but could you sign something for me?
DANNY It's for the guys in the joint.
DANNY They just love all your shows.
A queue of clubgoers erupt in a frenzy as Topher and company exit, and they begin signing autographs.
Danny and Rusty exit, too, but of course nobody gives a shit about them.
Danny and Rusty ride silently, staring out opposite windows at Sunset Boulevard.
RUSTY That was, that was just...
DANNY Unprofessional.
DANNY Rusty agrees.
RUSTY How was the clink?
RUSTY You get the cookies I sent you?
DANNY Why do you think I came to see you first?
DANNY Danny pulls out a wad of bills from his jacket, peels off half, and hands it to Rusty.
DANNY Ten grand.
DANNY Half of it's yours.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
5/31/01 12E.
RUSTY You barge into my new workplace, ruin my professional reputation, least you could do is tell me you've got something better for me.
DANNY I've got something better for you.
They're sitting in a booth over coffee.
RUSTY How's Tess?
Danny stares at him: next subject, please.
RUSTY Alright.
RUSTY Tell me.
DANNY It's tricky.
DANNY No one's ever done it before.
DANNY Needs planning, a large crew.
RUSTY Guns?
DANNY Not loaded ones.
DANNY It has to be very precise.
DANNY There's a lot of security.
DANNY But the take...
RUSTY What's the target?
DANNY Eight figures each.
RUSTY What's.
RUSTY The.
RUSTY Target.
DANNY When's the last time you were in Vegas?
RUSTY What?
RUSTY You wanna knock over a casino?
Danny puts down his coffee.
And shakes his head.
And lifts three fingers: three casinos.
Rusty must put down his coffee, too.
It's after hours downtown.
Dark, empty, dead...
Lights out on the 40th.
Engraved brass announces: J.A.
Two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant offices: Danny and Rusty on late-night reconnaissance.
As Danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, Rusty passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to its out box.
At last, Danny finds the right set of blueprints and drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it.
DANNY The vault at the Bellagio.
A beat as Rusty scans the document, then another underneath it.
RUSTY If I'm reading these right -- and I think that I am -- this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed.
RUSTY Oops.
RUSTY Actually, you know what, I'm wrong.
RUSTY It's definitely the least accessible vault ever designed.
DANNY Yep.
Rusty's brow furrows just a little.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 14.
RUSTY You said three casinos...
DANNY These feed into the cages at both the Mirage and the M.G.M. Grand.
DANNY But every dime ends up here.
RUSTY The Bellagio, Mirage, and...
RUSTY These are Terry Benedict's places.
DANNY Yes, they are.
DANNY Think he'll mind?
RUSTY More than somewhat.
No ding.
The elevator just arrives.
Its doors part to reveal a SECURITY GUARD within, here to make his tour; a large fellow, he has to duck to exit.
As Danny rolls up the set of blueprints, Rusty considers the plan (which, in our absence, Danny has pitched him).
RUSTY You'd need at least a dozen guys, doing a combination of cons.
DANNY Like what, you think?
RUSTY Well, off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks.
RUSTY Oh, and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever.
RUSTY Where do you think you're gonna get the money to back this?
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 15.
DANNY As long as we're hitting these three casinos, we'll get our bankroll.
DANNY Terry Benedict has a list of enemies.
RUSTY But does he have enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose...
RUSTY Aha.
DANNY Aha.
RUSTY Reuben.
22   MOVING WITH SECURITY GUARD                                      22 as he approaches Danny's and Rusty's voices...
DANNY So...
RUSTY So, here's what I think: You should take this plan, kick it around for a week or two.
RUSTY Sleep on it.
RUSTY Turn it over in your head.
RUSTY Then: never bring it up to me again.
DANNY Uh-huh.
DANNY So what are you saying?
RUSTY I'm saying: this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat.
DANNY Really?
DANNY I thought it was much harder than that --
Suddenly the Security Guard's flashlight beam hits them square in the eyes.
Danny and Rusty put their hands up to block the light.
DANNY Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little, will ya?
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 16.
SECURITY GUARD Sorry.
SECURITY GUARD You two done up here?
SECURITY GUARD Find what you wanted?
DANNY Yeah, thanks.
DANNY You mind if we borrow a couple drawings for the night?
DANNY Make some copies.
SECURITY GUARD Whatever you need.
Danny withdraws his money clip, peels off a couple hundreds, and buries them in the Security Guard's hand.
DANNY 'Preciate it.
Danny and Rusty wait for an elevator.
When its doors open, Rusty stops Danny from boarding.
RUSTY I need a reason.
RUSTY And don't say money.
RUSTY Why do this?
DANNY Why not do it?
Rusty stares at him: enough bullshitting around.
DANNY Because yesterday I walked out of the joint wearing my entire wardrobe and you're colddecking TeenBeat coverboys.
DANNY Because the house always wins.
DANNY You play long enough, never changing stakes, the house takes you.
DANNY Unless, when that special hand comes around, you bet big.
DANNY And then you take the house.
A beat.
Rusty smiles.
RUSTY You're been practicing that speech, haven't you?
DANNY A little.
DANNY Did I rush it?
DANNY It felt like I rushed it.
RUSTY No, it was good.
They step aboard the elevator.
As the door closes:
RUSTY I wonder what Reuben will say?
Danny and Rusty look at each other.
TISHKOFF (V.O.) You're out of your goddamn minds.
REUBEN TISHKOFF, the grimace of a man in mid-movement, forever cemented on his face, scrutinizes his two lunch guests (Danny and Rusty) at his poolside.
TISHKOFF Are you listening to me?
TISHKOFF You are, both of you, nuts.
TISHKOFF I know more about casino security than any man alive.
TISHKOFF I invented it, and it cannot be beaten.
TISHKOFF They got cameras, they got watchers, they got locks, they got timers, they got vaults.
TISHKOFF They got enough armed personnel to occupy Paris.
TISHKOFF Okay, bad example...
DANNY It's never been tried.
TISHKOFF Oh, it's been tried.
TISHKOFF A few guys even came close.
TISHKOFF You know the three most successful robberies in Vegas history?
An Adlai Stevenson-lookalike approaches a lockbox carrier from behind and snatches the box.
He takes almost three steps before five security men leap at him and -- FREEZE FRAME on his wide-eyed expression of horror...
TISHKOFF (V.O.) Number three.
TISHKOFF (V.O.) The bronze medal.
TISHKOFF (V.O.) Pencilneck grabs a lockbox at the Sands.
TISHKOFF (V.O.) He got two steps closer to the door than any living soul before him.
RESUME ACTION: Adlai Stevenson gets a taste of what NFL quarterbacks experience every Sunday...
five fold.
A hippie races toward the electronic sliding doors, clutching a tray full of chips, and as the doors begin to part for him -- FREEZE FRAME: A billy club appears out of nowhere...
TISHKOFF (V.O.) Second most successful robbery.
TISHKOFF (V.O.) The Flamingo '71.
TISHKOFF (V.O.) This guy actually smelled fresh oxygen before they got him.
RESUME ACTION: The billy club comes down -- whap!
-- across the hippie's skull and it's Chicago '68 all over again.
TISHKOFF (V.O.) Course, he was breathing out of a hose the next three weeks, goddamn hippie.
TISHKOFF And the closest any man has gotten to robbing a Las Vegas casino...
Tourists and valets scatter as a Euro-thief (pastel T-shirt beneath a white linen suit) bursts from the casino and takes five steps before -- FREEZE FRAME: GLASS EXPLODES from three different doors behind him and he arches his back in agony...
TISHKOFF Outside of Caesar's in '87.
TISHKOFF He came, he grabbed, he got conquered.
RESUME ACTION: BULLETS rip the man to shreds and he collapses on Caesar's steps a bloody pulp.
TISHKOFF But what am I saying?
TISHKOFF You guys are pros, the best.
TISHKOFF I'm sure you can make it out of the casino.
TISHKOFF Of course, lest we forget, once you're out the front door, you're still in the middle of the fucking desert!
Both Danny and Rusty look chastened.
RUSTY You're right.
RUSTY He's right.
DANNY Reuben, you're right.
DANNY Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs.
RUSTY That's exactly it.
RUSTY Pure ego.
TISHKOFF Yeah yeah blah blah.
DANNY Thank you so much for setting us straight.
DANNY Sorry we bothered you.
They both rise to go.
TISHKOFF Look, we all go way back.
TISHKOFF I owe you from that thing with the guy in the place, and I'll never forget it.
DANNY It was our pleasure.
RUSTY I'd never been to Belize.
TISHKOFF Give Dominic your addresses, I got some remaindered furniture I wanna send you.
Danny and Rusty begin to circle the pool to leave.
Tishkoff, of course, won't let them go that easily.
TISHKOFF Just out of curiosity, which casinos did you geniuses pick to rob?
Danny stops, almost as if he's been waiting for this question, which of course he has.
DANNY The Bellagio, Mirage, and the M.G.M.
DANNY Grand.
TISHKOFF Those are Terry Benedict's casinos.
RUSTY Say, you know, he's right.
Tishkoff waves them back, sipping on his umbrellaed cocktail.
TISHKOFF You guys...
TISHKOFF Whadda you got against Terry Benedict?
DANNY What do you have against him?
DANNY That's the real question.
TISHKOFF He torpedoed my casino, muscled me out, now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for another fuckin' eyesore.
TISHKOFF Don't think I don't see what you're doin'.
RUSTY What are we doing, Reuben?
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 21.
TISHKOFF You gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you better goddamn know.
TISHKOFF This sorta thing used to be civilized.
TISHKOFF You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you.
TISHKOFF Done.
TISHKOFF But Benedict...
TISHKOFF At the end of this he better not know you're involved, not know your names, or think you're dead.
TISHKOFF Because he'll kill you, and then he'll go to work on you.
DANNY That's why we've got to be very careful.
DANNY We have to be precise.
DANNY We have to be well-funded.
TISHKOFF Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too.
TISHKOFF And you're gonna need a crew as nuts as you are.
TISHKOFF Who do you have in mind?
Danny and Rusty both smile; they've hooked their fish.
And so it begins...
RUSTY (V.O.) Alright.
RUSTY (V.O.) Who's in?
DANNY (V.O.) Frank C. is in.
Frank Catton coughs mightily into a handkerchief.
Across a desk, his boss fills out paperwork.
DANNY (V.O.) Frank C. has developed a bad case of bronchitis and is putting in for a transfer to warmer climates.
Frank carries his bag toward the taxi bay.
He stops to light a cigarette, inhales with deep satisfaction before a banner: "WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS."
DANNY (V.O.) What about drivers?

CLOSE ON a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its ENGINE ROARING before a starting line, itching to cross it.
Now take a step back...
That souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper.
It's a remote-controlled toy.
The ROARING ENGINE comes from the vehicle next to it: an actual monster truck.
Both vehicles peer down the track at a finish line a hundred yards away.
This is a race.
The drivers stare each other down: TURK (behind the wheel of the truck) and VIRGIL (track-side, remote control in hand) MALLOY.
They're nice boys.
Really.
Peckerwoods, sure, but nice.
RUSTY (V.O.) I talked to the Malloys yesterday.
DANNY (V.O.) The Mormon twins?
RUSTY (V.O.) They're both in Salt Lake City, six months off the job.
RUSTY (V.O.) I got the sense they're having trouble filling the hours.
Lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the TRUCK COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil's toy zips to a lead.
It's looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his brother's vehicle.
Virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry.
DANNY (V.O.) Electronics?
RUSTY (V.O.) Livingston Dell.
On a black and white monitor: Two mobsters, on a meet in a public park, peer over their shoulders, making certain no one is watching them.
Little do they know...
...
LIVINGSTON DELL, audio-visual junkie, and victim of a continual flop sweat, crouches before their image, masterfully controlling his surveillance camera with a joystick in his left hand.
He is flanked by FBI MEN.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 23.
RUSTY (V.O.) Livingston's been doing freelance surveillance work of late for the F.B.I.
RUSTY (V.O.) Mob Squad.
DANNY (V.O.) How are his nerves?
RUSTY (V.O.) Okay.
RUSTY (V.O.) Not so bad you'd notice.
As a FBI Man reaches to adjust a monitor...
LIVINGSTON D-don't, don't-don't...
LIVINGSTON touch...
LIVINGSTON it.
FBI MAN #1 What?
LIVINGSTON Do you see me pulling the gun out of your holster and firing it?
FBI MAN #2 Hey, Radio Shack: relax.
Livingston walks down the boardwalk.
A rollerblader with a dog on a leash approaches and Livingston gets caught between the two.
As he struggles to untangle himself from the leash...
With a view of Livingston on the boardwalk...
Danny and Rusty wait for him over espressos.
RUSTY Munitions.
DANNY Phil Turentine.
RUSTY Dead.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 23A.
DANNY No shit?
DANNY On the job?
RUSTY Sun cancer.
DANNY You send flowers?
RUSTY Dated his wife a while.
DANNY Basher...
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 24.
RUSTY We may be too late.
37   INT. BANK - CLOSE ON BASHER TARR - NIGHT                       37 the explosives expert.
A pair of goggles over his eyes reflects a match being struck, then touched to a fuse.
BASHER Sweet...
BANG!
Wood shards and SPLINTERS of GLASS fly all around; Basher merely ducks his head and whistles.
As the dust settles, three men move quickly past Basher and into (what the settling fog now reveals to be) a dynamited bank vault.
ALARMS begin to sound: this is bad news.
BASHER You know, you guys had one job to do.
The men exit through the front doors, their hands over their heads, Basher trailing them.
Policemen and SWAT members encircle the group, weapons trained on them, chock full of instructions.
Basher sits in the rear, handcuffed behind his back, feet on the pavement.
An explosives COP kneels in front of him.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 25.
COP And that's all you used during the event?
COP Nothing else?
BASHER Are you accusing me of booby- trapping?
COP Well, how 'bout it?
VOICE Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
The Cop turns; standing behind him, stone-faced, is Rusty, in a dark suit and shades.
RUSTY Isn't that right, Basher?
BASHER That's right.
RUSTY Peck, A.T.F. Let me venture a guess.
RUSTY A simple G4 mainliner, double-coil, backwound, quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet.
RUSTY That's our man.
RUSTY Tell me something else.
RUSTY Have you checked him for booby traps on his person?
RUSTY I mean really checked, not just for weapons...
The Cop looks bewildered.
Rusty steps forward, yanks Basher onto his feet, spins him around.
He moves his hands up and down Basher's legs, around his waist, under his arms.
RUSTY Will you go find Griggs and tell him I need to see him?
COP Who?
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 26.
RUSTY Just go find him, will you?
RUSTY How fast can you put something together with what I passed you?
BASHER Done.
BASHER Thirty seconds all right?
RUSTY From when?
BASHER Now.
They're hurrying; ahead of them is a wall of squad cars, a police cordon, and a crowd of onlookers.
RUSTY Ten seconds?
BASHER Not quite.
BASHER Is Danny here?
RUSTY Around the corner.
BASHER Be good working with professionals again.
BASHER Okay: go.
And they both start running.
RUSTY Everyone down!
RUSTY Get down!
RUSTY There's a bomb in the...
And behind them the SQUAD CAR ERUPTS with a BANG!
A collective SCREAM rises from the crowd, everyone ducks, cops hit the ground and cover their heads.
Rusty and Basher move briskly past them, dodging their splayed legs like tires on an obstacle course.
By the time the Explosives Cop thinks to look around for Basher, they've both disappeared.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 27.
The Chinese National Circus, currently on tour in the Western United States.
Trapeze artists, gymnastic teams, and trampoline daredevils fly, somersault, spin, and swing through the air.
A full house applauds every feat.
Danny and Rusty sit in the bleachers, surrounded by parents and kids munching on spindles of cotton candy.
Tough guys in toyland.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen: the amazing Yen.
A funambulist (YEN) begins his high-wire act...
DANNY So he can walk on a rope.
RUSTY More than that.
DANNY So he can juggle.
DANNY We need a grease man, not an acrobat.
DANNY Who else is on the list?
RUSTY He is the list.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 28.
DANNY Who else?
RUSTY Watch.
Halfway across the wire, the funambulist sits.
And very slowly, but without hesitation, he contorts himself into a ball, never losing his balance.
Even Danny is impressed.
RUSTY There's your grease man.
Danny and Rusty exit the circus tent, head for their car.
DANNY We need Saul.
RUSTY He won't come.
RUSTY He swore off the game a year ago.
DANNY He get religion?
RUSTY Ulcers.
DANNY You can ask him.
Rusty stops, stares at Danny, sighs.
RUSTY I can ask.
SAUL BLOOM, 50s, befuddled, wearing a corduroy jacket patched at the elbows and a duffer's hat, counts out money through the window, lists his bets.
He checks his tickets, plunges them into his pants pocket, and moves off...
Rusty appears in the f.g.
behind a pillar, as dapper as Saul is down-at-heel, watching him go.
When Saul disappears into the tunnel, he moves.
Saul sits on one of the long, general admission steps under the box seats.
He produces an orange from his pocket, starts to peel it.
A pair of well-shined shoes appears behind him.
Saul senses their presence, but doesn't turn around.
SAUL I saw you in the paddock before the second race, outside the men's room, when I placed my bet.
SAUL I saw you before you even got up this morning.
RUSTY How ya been, Saul?
SAUL Never better.
RUSTY What's with the orange?
SAUL My doctor says I need vitamins.
RUSTY So why don't you take vitamins?
For the first time, Saul cranes his neck and shoots a look up at Rusty.
SAUL You come here to give me a physical?
RUSTY I got a box seat.
RUSTY Come on.
A waiter serves coffee to Rusty and Saul.
RUSTY I thought you drank bloody Mary's at the track, Saul.
SAUL A man shouldn't drink on the job.
RUSTY Who we rooting for here?
SAUL Number four.
There's the BELL; the electronic rabbit is released and the dogs break out of the gate.
From this point on Saul's eyes never leave the race.
SAUL You gonna ask me?
SAUL Or should I just say no and get it over with?
RUSTY Saul, you're the best there is.
RUSTY You're in Cooperstown.
RUSTY What do you want?
SAUL Nothin'.
SAUL I got a duplex now, I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish, I'm seeing a nice lady, she works the unmentionables counter at Macy's.
SAUL I've changed.
RUSTY Guys like us don't change, Saul.
RUSTY We stay sharp or we get sloppy, but we don't change.
SAUL Quit connin' me.
They watch the race.
RUSTY That your hound way in the back there?
SAUL He breaks late.
SAUL Everyone knows this.
On the track: The dogs are now coming around the back stretch, and the crowd on the bleachers rises, cheering.
SAUL You gonna treat me like a grownup at least?
SAUL Tell me what the scam is?
Under the noise: Rusty leans in and whispers in Saul's ear.
Saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around him people are standing and shouting.
Rusty places an envelope in Saul's lap, then gets up and walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish line...
last by several lengths.
Saul considers his options.
In one hand: a fan of losing tickets.
In the other (courtesy of Rusty): a ticket to Las Vegas.
DANNY (V.O.) And Saul makes ten.
Danny and Rusty look weary from all this recruitment.
A nearby TV with the sound off plays a promo for an upcoming Tyson fight.
DANNY Ten should do it, don't you think?
DANNY You think we need one more?
DANNY You think we need one more.
DANNY Okay.
DANNY We'll get one more.
Native Chicagoans demonstrate their indigenous sixth sense -- L-car balance -- as the TRAIN bends and SHAKES at a corner.
One passenger in particular keeps his footing, a young man in a frayed jacket: LINUS.
Two overgroomed STOCKBROKERS stand with their backs to the young man, yammering about high interest yields, and consequently they don't notice (and neither do we, not at first) that Linus is slowly picking one of their pockets.
The thievery is glacier-paced: Linus, his face always forward and inscrutable, gingerly raises one tail of his target's Brooks Brothers jacket and then, with incomparable dexterity, unbuttons his wallet pocket with a flick of his thumb and forefinger.
From halfway down the train car, nothing appears amiss, and no passenger looks the wiser.
Or so it seems...
A copy of the Chicago Sun-Times, opened and upheld, lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at Linus.
It is Danny, smirk on his lips: He (and he alone) is aware of the ongoing heist.
Back to Linus, his spoils (a Gucci wallet) now in sight, but he waits for just the right moment, and then, when the train hits another curve...
...
he stumbles forward, his left hand finding support on the Stockbroker's shoulder as his right relieves the man of his wallet.
LINUS Sorry 'bout that.
STOCKBROKER No problem, guy.
The Stockbroker resumes his yacketing, oblivious, as Linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket, face betraying nothing.
Only Danny appreciates the artistry performed here today.
He folds the Sun-Times under his arm as...
...
The SUBWAY SQUEALS to a stop.
Linus jumps out, leaving his prey aboard, and a few moments later, Danny steps off, too.
The hurly-burly of rush hour in Union Station.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 33.
Commuters zig and zag, this way and that, all on furious schedules, and Linus slips blithely through them, in no hurry, a man who's pulled this job a thousand times before.
He dodges and sidesteps crazed commuters, and except for a brief brush with one well-dressed man (the Sun-Times tucked under his arm), he escapes the station without incident.
Linus exits, casually reaching into his jacket to count his winnings.
And his face falls.
All he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a calling card.
On one side, in engraved printing: "DANIEL OCEAN."
On the flip side, in handwriting: "Nice pull.
Murphy's Bar, Rush & Division."
On a tabletop: the Gucci wallet beside a half-drunk Guinness.
Linus enters the front door, cases the joint, spots the wallet on the table, and Danny behind it.
DANNY Hi, Linus.
DANNY Sit down.
LINUS Who are you?
DANNY A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.
DANNY Sit down.
Linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he sits.
DANNY Bobby told me about you.
DANNY Said you were the best set of hands he ever saw.
DANNY Didn't expect to find you working wallets on the subway.
LINUS That wasn't work, that was practice.
Danny reaches into his jacket and sets a plane ticket on the table.
He keeps his hand over it.
DANNY You're either in or out, right now.
LINUS What is it?
DANNY A plane ticket.
DANNY A job offer.
LINUS You're pretty trusting pretty fast.
DANNY Bobby has every faith in you.
LINUS Fathers are like that.
LINUS He didn't tell you?
LINUS He doesn't like me trading on his name.
DANNY You do this job, he'll be trading on yours.
LINUS What if I say no?
DANNY We'll get someone else who won't be quite as good.
DANNY You can go back to feeling up stockbrokers.
Linus considers.
He looks down at the ticket, then at the wallet.
It's one or the other.
A waitress passes, and Danny signals her for his bill.
When his attention returns to Linus, the wallet remains...
but the ticket beneath his hand is gone.
Linus is reading it.
DANNY That's the best lift I've seen you make yet.
LINUS Las Vegas, huh?
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 35.
DANNY America's playground.
And our MAIN THEME KICKS IN as we...
The city looms out of the desert like an infernal machine, lights flashing, skyline pulsing, a neon fortress.
One thing in particular catches our eye: an enormous billboard with an ad for the upcoming boxing match between Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis.
Below it, a promoter hands out fliers for strip joints and call girls.
Frank Catton is already here, mixing a drink, when -- DING DONG -- the DOORBELL CHIMES.
Tishkoff shuffles toward the front (he's given the help the night off) and opens his door to find...
LIVINGSTON Trick or treat.
...
Livingston, Basher, Yen, the Malloys, Saul and Linus crowding his doormat.
A taxi-van pulls away behind them.
TISHKOFF What, you guys get a group rate or something?
Along one wall, a buffet table has been set up, and while Virgil and Turk pile shrimp onto plates, Saul pockets an orange for later.
TURK You make it out to Utah much, Saul?
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 36.
SAUL Not as much as I'd like.
TURK You should.
TURK You'd like it.
TURK You'd like Provo.
VIRGIL Anybody see the salsa goes with this?
At the wet bar, Basher mixes a drink for Livingston; on a couch, Yen balances coffee-table ornaments into a skyscraper, to Frank's astonishment.
In a corner, off on his own, Linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing, wary.
Until...
DANNY Gentlemen: welcome to Las Vegas.
Danny stands at the top of the stairs leading into the room, flanked by Rusty and Tishkoff.
He starts down...
DANNY Everybody eaten?
DANNY Good.
DANNY Everybody sober?
DANNY Close enough.
DANNY Most of you know each other already.
DANNY You probably haven't met Linus Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid outta Chicago.
Linus trades nods around the room.
DANNY Okay.
DANNY Before we start, nobody's on the line here yet.
DANNY What I'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous.
DANNY If that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey.
DANNY No hard feelings.
DANNY Otherwise, come with me.
He turns and walks out of the living room, into another.
Rusty is close behind; he turns briefly, casts an eye over the assembled and keeps going.
The guys look each other over, sizing things up.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 37.
BASHER What the hell.
And he follows, along with Frank and Livingston.
Then Virgil, Turk and Yen.
Then Saul.
That leaves Linus, watching the line of men disappear.
He turns to find Tishkoff by his side, staring at him.
LINUS Hi.
TISHKOFF You're Bobby Caldwell's kid, huh?
LINUS Yeah.
TISHKOFF From Chicago?
LINUS Yeah.
TISHKOFF It's nice there.
TISHKOFF You like it?
LINUS Yeah.
TISHKOFF That's wonderful.
TISHKOFF Get in the goddamn room.
A tournament-level pool table holds center stage here.
Atop its green felt sits a raised, elaborate miniature of Terry Benedict's Las Vegas: three casinos and hotels with the Strip running between them.
As the eleven surround the table and the model...
DANNY Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard.
DANNY Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M. Grand.
DANNY Together, they're the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas...
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 38.
Danny removes the Strip from the model.
Revealed beneath is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator shaft which descends into an enormous vault.
DANNY Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault.
DANNY Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth.
DANNY It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it.
DANNY And we're going to rob it.
Everyone takes a breath, awed.
LINUS Smash-and-grab job, huh?
RUSTY It's a little more complicated than that.
Danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of Tvs.
DANNY Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos.
On the monitors: three montages of black-and-white security tapes, starting within the three casinos' cages, moving into the tunnels, then (as the TVs unite in their images) pushing into the elevator and eventually the vault.
As the group's glances shoot back and forth from the TV to the corresponding section of the model, i.e.
from a POV of the tunnel to the miniature tunnel itself...
DANNY Okay.
DANNY Bad news first.
DANNY This place houses a security system which rivals most nuclear missile silos.
DANNY First: we have to get within the casino cages --
RUSTY -- here, here, and here --
DANNY -- which anyone knows takes more than a smile.
DANNY Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours.
DANNY Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications --
RUSTY -- which we can't fake --
DANNY -- and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - -
RUSTY -- which we won't get.
DANNY Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors --
RUSTY -- meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped.
DANNY Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man.
DANNY Any questions?
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 40.
Silence.
For a moment, each man keeps his two dozen questions or more to himself.
At last, one speaks up...
The Amazing Yen.
In Cantonese.
Of course, no one understands him.
Except Rusty.
RUSTY No.
RUSTY Tunneling is out.
RUSTY There are Richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction.
RUSTY If a groundhog tried to nest there, they'd know about it.
RUSTY Anyone else?
Another silence.
Either the guys are too dumbfounded by that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead of them to speak.
TURK You said something about good news...
DANNY The Nevada Gaming Commission stipulates: a casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor.
DANNY As I mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos above it.
DANNY That means: during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin.
DANNY On a weekend, between eighty and ninety million.
DANNY On a fight night, like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we're going to rob it, at least a hundred and fifty million.
DANNY Without breaking a sweat.
DANNY Now there are eleven of us.
DANNY Each with an equal share.
DANNY You do the math.
MOVING AROUND the table ON ten faces, as everyone does precisely that, in their heads, except for Virgil who does it on his fingers.
He whistles.
RUSTY That's what I said.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 41-43.
Everyone seems suitably impressed by their share.
SAUL I have a question.
SAUL Say we do get into the cage, and through the security doors there, and down the elevator we can't move, and past the guards with guns, and into the vault we can't open...
RUSTY Without being seen by the cameras.
DANNY Oh, right.
DANNY Sorry.
DANNY I forgot to mention that.
SAUL Say we do all that.
SAUL We're just supposed to walk outta there with a hundred million dollars in cash on us without getting stopped?
Danny smiles, his broad, sure-of-himself grin, the one Rusty couldn't deny earlier and these guys won't deny now.
DANNY Yeah.
Saul looks panic-stricken; like that, his ulcer has flared up, and he pops a Rolaid in his mouth.
DANNY Alright.
DANNY Here's how we'll begin.
MOVING WITH a cash cart as security guards push it past tourists, past cocktail waitresses, past Linus sitting at a blackjack table.
DANNY (V.O.) First task: reconnaissance.
DANNY (V.O.) I want to know everything that's going on in all three casinos.
DANNY (V.O.) From the rotation of the dealers to the path of every cash cart...
Two security TECHNICIANS on a smoke break grumble about their sex lives.
Across the room, Frank sits innocently doing a crossword.
DANNY (V.O.) I wanna know everything about every guard, every watcher, anyone with a security pass.
DANNY (V.O.) I wanna know where they're from, what their nicknames are, how they take their coffee...
REVEALS: On his crossword, Frank has scribbled a transcript of the Technicians' conversation.
As he glances up at an electronic keycard clipped to one Technician's belt...
...
an identical keycard is swiped through a keypad, its light flashing red to green, admitting a guard into an "Employees Only" doorway.
The Malloys, who've shadowed the guard here, note a sentry standing watch by the door as well as a security camera embedded in the ceiling above: No one walks through that portal unchecked.
DANNY (V.O.) Most of all, I want you guys to know these casinos.
DANNY (V.O.) They were built as labyrinths, to keep people in.
DANNY (V.O.) I want you guys to know the quick routes out.
Their job done, the Malloys start toward the casino's exit...
in different directions.
They begin to argue: The exit's that way -- no, it's that way.
With two dozen other tourists, Basher crosses the street and when he meets a manhole cover he stops and, extracting a small metal hook from his jacket, removes it from its perch, so casual about the action that no passerby looks twice at him.
DANNY (V.O.) Second task: power.
DANNY (V.O.) On the night of the fight, we're gonna throw the switch on sin city.
DANNY (V.O.) Basher, it's your show.
Basher drops into the hole, pulling the cover over him, as we PULL UP OVER the Bellagio and...
Dozens of monitors manned by dozens of watchers canvas dozens of casino tables; only NASA's control rooms house more technology.
Apart from the fray, another bank of monitors manned by two watchers (let's call them, for no particular reason, FAT and SLIM) oversee a different section of the casino: the cage, its tunnels, the elevator, and the vault it leads to; everything, in fact, which our team saw in the game room.
DANNY (V.O.) Third task: surveillance.
DANNY (V.O.) Casino security has an eye and ear on everything, so we'll want an eye and ear on them.
DANNY (V.O.) Livingston...
A page of the set Danny and Rusty "borrowed" from Kuehn & Associates.
Danny and Livingston study it.
LIVINGSTON Well, it's not the least accessible system I've seen, but it's close.
LIVINGSTON I don't suppose they have a closed-circuit feed I could tap into?
Danny shakes his head: no such luck.
LIVINGSTON Then this is definitely a black bag job.
LIVINGSTON Do they employ an in- house technician?
Danny looks to Rusty who, behind them, tampers with Livingston's audio-video setup: several portable monitors, a laptop and modem, telephone headset, etc.
RUSTY Two.
RUSTY And one of them is lonely.
DANCE MUSIC overwhelms the SOUNDTRACK...
...
as we join a lap dance already in progress.
A security Technician (one of the two Frank eavesdropped on in the break room) shells out twenty bucks every three minutes for a DANCER to grind her pelvis against his chest...
...
and while the Technician grins not-very-soberly and ogles her perfect breasts and paws at her midriff, the Dancer secretly removes the keycard from his belt.
DANCER I'll be right back, honey.
DANCER Don't move a muscle.
TECHNICIAN Depends on the muscle.
She pouts, flirtingly, as she does for every idiot who drops a line like that, then makes her way to...
...
where Rusty waits for her, and when she slips him the keycard, he slips her a c-note.
RUSTY Thanks, Charmaine.
RUSTY I'll have it back within the hour.
RUSTY Say hello to your mom for me.
DANCER Say it yourself.
DANCER She'll be onstage in five minutes.
FOLLOWING a bunch of balloons -- all congratulating "Happy Anniversary!" -- as a delivery boy carries them through the casino, and just as he's passing an "Employees Only" door (complete with sentry and embedded ceiling camera)...
...
he bumps into a TOURIST, and the balloons drift out of his hand and into the camera...
TOURIST Hey, watch it, bud...
As the balloons fill the frame of one monitor...
SLIM 433, we have visual impairment on the east door camera.
The SENTRY (#433) hears this and spots the balloons covering the embedded camera and approaches the delivery boy (who by freak accident happens to be Virgil Malloy)...
SENTRY Excuse me, sir: You're going to have to move your balloons.
...
but Virgil's too busy picking a fight with the Tourist (surprise, surprise: Turk Malloy) to listen.
VIRGIL Who you calling 'bud,' pal?
TURK (TOURIST) Who you calling 'pal,' friend?
VIRGIL Who you calling 'friend'...
VIRGIL ...
VIRGIL bud...
And with the Sentry out of position...
...
Livingston (dressed now in a technician's uniform, don't worry about how he got it) goes quickly to the door and swipes the newly-acquired keycard and when it flashes red-to-green, he enters...
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 48.
He's in.
Livingston takes a moment, his brow perspiring (he's in the lions' den now), then checks his palm: drawn there in ballpoint is a diagram of the cage corridors.
Livingston appears and, as nonchalantly as he can, he ambles down a hallway, then another, until he reaches...
...
an unmarked door next to the entrance to the security center.
Livingston swipes his keycard to enter...
A giant walk-in closet/switchboard full of wires, plugs, lights, etc.
Livingston goes to work:
He splices into all sorts of wires and lines and cables.
Meanwhile...
...
Virgil and Turk argue, nose-to-nose, "accidentally" blocking the Sentry from the balloons...
VIRGIL You hear about this new medical discovery they made?
VIRGIL It's called a 'sense of direction.' Apparently we're all supposed to have one...
TURK Yeah yeah yeah, whatever, balloon boy.
SENTRY Gentlemen, gentlemen...
Livingston's work here is almost done: he clips a small mechanism (known in his industry as a "spider" -- it's small, black, antenna-less and hides in dark places) to a main conduit, then verifies a tiny receiver he holds is picking up the spider's feed.
One last click into place...
...
causes a brief, unnoticed blip on Slim's monitors...
...
and transmits all the views of the cages onto the monitors upstairs.
Danny and Rusty witness their appearance.
DANNY Why do they paint hallways that color?
RUSTY They say taupe is very soothing.
Livingston steps outside.
His job done, he exhales and wipes the sweat from his brow and checks his palm for directions and...
Whoops.
His sweat just smeared the ballpoint.
He's flying blind.
He looks left down a corridor, then right, trying to remember which way he came from.
No idea.
DANNY Uh-oh.
MOVING WITH Livingston as he tries to find his way out.
He takes a left...
Whoops again: here comes Fat, dead ahead.
Livingston has no recourse but to march right by him.
FAT Hiya.
LIVINGSTON Fine, thanks.
Livingston continues on, and maybe for a second he thinks he's in the clear, especially when he sees the exit looming ahead, but then Fat turns behind him and hails him back...
FAT Hey...
At last, the Sentry outmaneuvers Virgil and Turk and grabs the balloons himself.
Virgil quickly snatches them back...
VIRGIL Hey...
VIRGIL get your own balloons.
Livingston approaches the exit's keypad and swipes his keycard: the light does not flash red-to-green.
FAT Hey...
Livingston looks: he swiped the wrong side of his keycard.
He tries again.
Red flashes to green.
He pulls the door...
...
but Fat blocks it.
Livingston peers up, certain he's had it.
Danny and Rusty simultaneously lean forward.
FAT You dropped this.
Fat holds out Livingston's receiver and drops it in his hand.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 51.
LIVINGSTON Thanks.
And he's out.
Danny and Rusty exhale.
DANNY Well...
RUSTY Yeah...
DANNY Fourth task: construction...
The gang hauls building materials -- lumber, tools, paint, etc.
-- and Yen hauls three times his share, carrying objects on his head/shoulders/arms, a circus act in a hardware store.
DANNY (V.O.) We need to build an exact, working replica of the Bellagio vault.
RUSTY (V.O.) For practice.
DANNY (V.O.) Something like that.
As Linus hauls in materials, Danny takes him aside.
DANNY Fifth task: intelligence.
DANNY We need those codes, Linus.
DANNY From the only man who has all three.
LINUS Benedict.
DANNY Learn to love his shadow.
DANNY Sixth task: transport...
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 52.
LINUS Wait, wait, wait.
LINUS All I get to do is watch him?
DANNY For now.
DANNY You gotta walk before you crawl.
RUSTY Reverse that.
DANNY Sixth task: transport...
Outside a window: Turk and Virgil jump up and down on opposite bumpers of a van, testing its durability.
Inside, Frank negotiates with BILLY TIM, a Cal- Worthingtonesque redneck car dealer, who half-pays attention to him, half-frets over the Malloys outside.
BILLY TIM I'm sorry: eighteen-five each is the best offer I can make you.
FRANK Oh, I understand perfectly.
FRANK They are beautiful vans.
FRANK Well, I thank you for your time, Mister...?
BILLY TIM Denham.
BILLY TIM Billy Tim Denham.
FRANK Yes, Denham, like a jean.
FRANK You know: you have lovely hands -- do you moisturize?
BILLY TIM I'm sorry?
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 53.
Frank's not letting go of the man's hand, the object now is to force Billy Tim into lowering his price just to get Frank out of his office.
FRANK I swear by it.
FRANK I try all sorts of lotions.
FRANK I went through a fragrance-free period last year, but now I'm liking this new brand fortified with rose hip.
FRANK My sister, you know, she uses the aloe vera with the sun screen built in...
BILLY TIM Uh-huh.
BILLY TIM You said you'd be willing to pay in cash?
FRANK I did.
FRANK You know: they say cinnamon is wonderful for your pores.
FRANK Read that on the internet.
FRANK And that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed, but I find that would interfere with my social agenda.
FRANK Problem is: I get a reaction to camphor so I can't use traditional remedies...
BILLY TIM If you could pay cash, I could probably drop the price a little.
BILLY TIM To, say, seventeen...
BILLY TIM ...
BILLY TIM sixteen each.
FRANK That would be lovely.
89   INT. WAREHOUSE - BACK TO DANNY - DAY                           89 overseeing the construction, reviewing his list of tasks on his fingers, suspecting he's missed one.
DANNY ...
DANNY Power, surveillance, transport...
TISHKOFF Anything I can do?
Danny's eyes flash from Tishkoff to Saul, behind him, dressed in his usual frumpy attire: that's what he missed.
DANNY Get your wallet.
A tailor fits Saul for the finest suits Tishkoff's money can buy.
As Saul smoothes out a coat sleeve...
SAUL This is nice material.
DANNY It's Armani, Saul.
SAUL It's very nice.
Saul's not fooling anyone: he's scared, right down to his Florsheims.
Danny nods to the tailor: "Give us a moment."
DANNY Saul, you sure you're ready to do this?
Saul turns away, and when he faces Danny again, his entire aspect has changed: His features stone, his eyes icicles.
SAUL If you ever question me again, Daniel, you won't wake up the following morning.
They exchange a long, fierce glance; Saul's eyes never waver.
DANNY You're ready.
Danny signals Tishkoff: let's pay, and Saul immediately slumps into his old self.
To a mirror, he practices...
SAUL Hello.
SAUL My name is Lyman Zerga...
SAUL My name is Lyman Zerga...
Saul's dressed completely (and immaculately) now in Armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge of his nose.
He continues to practice, his accent even deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could be Scottish, could be Israeli...
SAUL My name is Lyman Zerga...
SAUL My name is Lyman Zerga...
Danny passes him an envelope full of $100 bills.
DANNY There's a little over twenty grand there, Saul.
DANNY Try to make it last.
Saul pats down his pockets for something he can't find...
SAUL You seen my...
DANNY Bought you a fresh roll.
The limo pulls to a stop, and outside there is a flurry of FOOTSTEPS before Saul's door swings open, and Turk and Virgil (both costumed as bodyguards) stand waiting for him.
VIRGIL Mr. Zerga, we're here.
DANNY Good luck, Lyman.
SAUL Luck is for losers.
Saul, as Lyman Zerga, makes as low-profile an entrance into the Bellagio as he can with bodyguards preceding and trailing him.
He approaches a V.I.P CONCIERGE...
V.I.P. CONCIERGE Good afternoon, sir.
V.I.P. CONCIERGE How can I be of service?
V.I.P. CONCIERGE OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
V.I.P. CONCIERGE 1/8/01 56.
SAUL My name is Lyman Zerga.
SAUL I'd like a suite, please.
V.I.P. CONCIERGE Do you have a reservation with us?
SAUL I don't make reservations.
SAUL A longer glance at Lyman's bodyguards tells the Concierge this is not a man to be denied.
SAUL As he jumps to it...
Outside a restaurant's entrance, Rusty and Linus sit before two slot machines, idly dropping in quarters as they watch Saul receive the royal treatment.
RUSTY Okay.
RUSTY Tell me about Benedict.
LINUS The guy is a machine.
TERRY BENEDICT emerges from a Town Car and, from his haircut to his smile to his pant-cuffs, he is effortless perfection.
He is Vegas royalty, yet he denies eye contact to no man.
He strides into his casino and, appearing behind a pillar, Linus follows him in.
LINUS (V.O.) He arrives at the Bellagio every day at two p.m.
LINUS (V.O.) Same Town Car, same driver.
LINUS (V.O.) Remembers every valet's name on the way in.
LINUS (V.O.) Not bad for a guy worth three-quarters of a billion.
The doors open, and Terry Benedict steps out.
Linus watches from a craps table.
LINUS (V.O.) Offices are upstairs.
LINUS (V.O.) He works hard, hits the lobby floor at seven on the nose.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 57.
From a balcony, Benedict stands overlooking the casino floor.
His CASINO MANAGER approaches and they confer.
LINUS (V.O.) Spends three minutes on the floor with his casino manager.
RUSTY (V.O.) What do they talk about?
LINUS (V.O.) All business.
LINUS (V.O.) Benedict likes to know what's going on in his casinos.
LINUS (V.O.) There's rarely an incident he doesn't know about or handle personally.
Benedict works the room.
He speaks to a Japanese High Roller in Japanese, to a Swiss in German, etc.
LINUS (V.O.) He spends a few minutes gladhanding the high rollers.
LINUS (V.O.) He's fluent in Spanish, German and Italian, and he's taking Japanese lessons, getting pretty good at it.
LINUS (V.O.) He's out by seven-thirty, when an assistant hands him a black portfolio.
LINUS (V.O.) Contents: the day's take and new security codes.
LINUS (V.O.) Then he heads to the restaurant.
Indeed, as Benedict makes his exit, an assistant hands him a black portfolio.
Rusty and Linus watch the entrance: No one enters.
LINUS Give him another ten seconds.
Around the corner comes Benedict, carrying his black portfolio.
LINUS As I said: a machine.
RUSTY And that portfolio contains the codes to all the cage doors?
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
3/30/01 58.
LINUS Two minutes after they've been changed, he's got 'em in hand.
LINUS I'll tell you: you guys picked a helluva target.
LINUS He is as smart and ruthless as they come.
LINUS The last guy caught cheating here, Benedict not only sent him up for ten years, he got the bank to seize the guy's home and bankrupted --
RUSTY -- his brother-in-law's tractor dealership, I heard.
LINUS He doesn't just go after your knees, he goes after your livelihood.
LINUS And everyone-you- ever-met's livelihood.
RUSTY You scared?
LINUS You suicidal?
RUSTY Only in the morning.
RUSTY Now what?
LINUS Now comes the girl...
LINUS if she comes in after he does, that means they're in a snit.
RUSTY Where's she come from?
LINUS The museum downstairs.
LINUS She's the curator there.
LINUS Wait...
LINUS here she is.
LINUS You'll like this.
Rusty looks up as...
...
a beautiful woman (the one Danny saw on Benedict's arm in the New York Times photo) appears.
Elegantly dressed, a knockout, she moves very much in her own private space.
And Rusty's face just about drops at the sight of her.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
3/30/01 58A.
LINUS I don't know if we can use her yet.
LINUS I haven't even caught her name.
RUSTY Tess.
LINUS What?
RUSTY Her name is Tess.
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 1/8/01 59.
Construction continues into the wee hours.
A facsimile of the Bellagio vault sprouts into shape.
Livingston fixes a security camera in a corner, then matches its image (of Frank staple-gunning floorboard into place) to a security tape of the real McCoy.
On the other side of the garage, Turk and Virgil go to work on their newly-purchased vans, with wrenches and blow torches.
Tishkoff recognizes a gasket Virgil handles.
TISHKOFF This looks familiar.
TISHKOFF Where'd you get this?
VIRGIL Off your Rolls.
TISHKOFF Danny!
TISHKOFF Tell 'em not to touch the Rolls!
TISHKOFF Overlooking the whole enterprise is Danny, grinning from ear to ear, happy in his work.
TISHKOFF He checks a stopwatch in his hand as...
TISHKOFF ...
TISHKOFF the false top to the cash cart before him flies open, revealing Yen within, his arms, legs and torso folded into a three-by-four foot space.
TISHKOFF He whips an air hose from his mouth and inhales deeply.
TISHKOFF Danny checks his watch.
DANNY 29:47.
DANNY Everything okay in there?
DANNY Yen responds.
DANNY Of course, Danny doesn't understand him.
DANNY But Rusty does, appearing behind him.
RUSTY But what doesn't beat the shit out of being a circus performer?
RUSTY Danny turns to Rusty: he looks very, very serious.
Danny and Rusty adjourn from the warehouse.
DANNY What is it?
RUSTY Tell me this isn't about her.
RUSTY Or I'll walk off the job right now.
RUSTY Tess.
RUSTY She's with Terry Benedict now.
RUSTY Tell me this isn't about screwing the guy who's screwing your wife.
DANNY Ex-wife.
RUSTY Tell me.
DANNY It's not.
DANNY About that.
DANNY Entirely.
DANNY A beat.
DANNY You said you needed a reason.
DANNY Well, this is mine.
DANNY When we started in this business, we had three rules.
DANNY We weren't gonna hurt anybody.
DANNY We weren't gonna steal from anybody didn't have it coming.
DANNY And we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose.
DANNY Well, I lost something.
DANNY Someone.
DANNY That's why I'm here.
DANNY A beat.
RUSTY Here's the problem: we're stealing two things now.
RUSTY And when push comes to shove, if you can't have both, which are you gonna choose?
RUSTY And remember: Tess doesn't divide eleven ways.
RUSTY A beat.
DANNY If things go to plan, I won't be the one who has to make that choice.
DANNY The two men stand quietly for a moment.
DANNY How'd she look by the way?
DANNY Tess...
RUSTY I've seen her happier.
TESS (V.O.) 'Radiant' is the word.
TESS (V.O.) Absolutely radiant.
The painting hangs under a portrait lamp on a wall between a van Gogh and a Monet.
At a distance, admiring it, are Tess, the SELLER and the seller's AIDE-DE-CAMP.
A staff photographer and other personnel mill nearby.
Off to the side, in a sharp blazer, Tess stands transfixed by the painting.
TESS He painted it in the summer of 1912, after the break-up with Fernande Olivier.
SELLER She must have put him through hell.
TESS You can see the conflict.
TESS He makes her both erotic and grotesque.
TESS He's hopelessly drawn to her, and yet she drives him crazy.
AIDE-DE-CAMP Mr. Santaniello has an early flight.
AIDE-DE-CAMP Do you think Mr. Benedict will be late?
TESS Mr. Benedict is never late.
TESS Just then the double doors to the gallery swing open, and Terry Benedict enters, right on time.
TESS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TESS 5/31/01 62.
He is elegant, beaming, commanding.
All that's missing is a blare of trumpets.
BENEDICT Am I late?
TESS Not at all, Mr. Benedict.
TESS Allow me to introduce to you Mr.
TESS Jean Santaniello.
BENEDICT Mr. Santaniello, I apologize if I kept you.
BENEDICT I had to iron out a few issues with my fight promoter.
BENEDICT I gave him an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.
SELLER I understand it's going to be a hell of a fight.
BENEDICT We hope.
BENEDICT Tess angles Benedict toward the painting.
TESS Here it is.
TESS Benedict moves toward the painting, and as he does he
catches Tess in his glance, and his smile deepens.
Then:
BENEDICT Magnificent!
BENEDICT I've been following her for fifteen years now.
BENEDICT At last I've made her a home.
BENEDICT All the arrangements and so forth...
SELLER Done.
SELLER She's yours.
BENEDICT Not mine.
BENEDICT She belongs to everyone who comes into my hotel.
BENEDICT Isn't that right, Ms. Ocean?
TESS Yes, Mr. Benedict.
BENEDICT She's lovely, isn't she?
BENEDICT I can't be the only one who was after her.
SELLER You're the only one who met my price.
BENEDICT Ah, but this...
BENEDICT You can't put a price on beauty.
BENEDICT But I shouldn't philosophize.
BENEDICT I own casinos, after all.
AIDE-DE-CAMP Can we get a quick shot?
AIDE-DE-CAMP Mr.
AIDE-DE-CAMP Santaniello has a plane to catch.
BENEDICT Of course, of course.
BENEDICT Tess understands: she is not to be part of the photo.
BENEDICT Benedict and the Seller pose together and...
BENEDICT Flash!
The Seller exits with the Aide-De-Camp in tow.
Benedict remains, enthralled by the painting.
Tess appears beside him.
TESS You like it?
BENEDICT I like that you like it.
BENEDICT I have some bad news from the world of high fashion.
BENEDICT It seems Mike Tyson will be wearing red on Saturday night.
BENEDICT Red trunks with a white stripe.
TESS Oh?
TESS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TESS 1/8/01 64.
BENEDICT And you, as I recall, will be wearing a red Donna Karan?
BENEDICT And when the TV cameras pick us up in the front row, that red dress...
TESS I see.
BENEDICT He's a charming man, but no one's going to be watching him when they can make a study of you.
BENEDICT I've asked Paolo to find three or four things for you to try.
BENEDICT I hope you're not too disappointed.
BENEDICT She is, but she buries it.
BENEDICT Are you sure?
BENEDICT She nods, smiles faintly.
BENEDICT I'll see you tonight.
BENEDICT Instinctively she leans in to kiss him.
BENEDICT He recoils ever so slightly.
TESS What?
TESS We're alone.
TESS He lets his eyes wander along the length of the ceiling, over all the eye-in-the-sky cameras hidden there.
TESS She follows his look.
BENEDICT In my hotels, there's always someone watching.
BENEDICT But he kisses her anyway.
TESS I'll see you tonight.
TESS He glances once more on the Picasso as he moves away.
BENEDICT Actually, I do like it.
BENEDICT And Tess remains, thinking: he's rich, he's handsome and wooing, but is she happy?
BENEDICT OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BENEDICT 10/24/00 65.
103    OMITTED                                                     103 thru thru
Quiet, elegant, tense.
One table is operating only, in the corner, and at it Saul, as Lyman Zerga, furtively peels at the roll of Rolaids and slips one in his mouth.
HIGH ROLLER #1 Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?
SAUL I don't believe in weakness.
SAUL It costs too much.
SAUL I don't believe in questions, either.
This shuts the High Roller up fast.
Saul looks up from the table, just perceptibly, to spot Terry Benedict, on his way in, right on schedule.
He approaches the PIT BOSS by the entrance.
BENEDICT Eddie.
BENEDICT Anything for me?
PIT BOSS Mr. Zerga, sir.
PIT BOSS Lyman Zerga.
PIT BOSS In the third position.
PIT BOSS Wishes to speak with you privately.
BENEDICT Who is he?
PIT BOSS Businessman of some kind, working mostly in Europe.
PIT BOSS He's very vague, but I asked around.
PIT BOSS Word is he deals primarily in arms.
PIT BOSS One of the biggest.
BENEDICT Zerga?
BENEDICT Never heard of him.
PIT BOSS Yessir.
PIT BOSS That's why I don't doubt it.
BENEDICT He's staying here?
PIT BOSS Checked in two nights ago, sir.
PIT BOSS He's in the Mirador suite.
BENEDICT How's he doing?
PIT BOSS Up.
PIT BOSS Almost forty grand.
BENEDICT Good for him...
Tess Ocean sits in a booth and sips at a glass of wine and checks her watch: Benedict is late or very close to being so...
BENEDICT OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BENEDICT 10/24/00 67.
...
when a pair of hands slips over her shoulders and starts to caress her arms.
TESS You're thirty seconds late.
TESS I was about to send out a search party...
TESS Danny...
DANNY Hello, Tess.
TESS What are you doing here?
DANNY I'm out.
TESS You're out.
DANNY Of prison.
DANNY You remember.
DANNY The day I went for cigarettes and never came back.
DANNY You must have noticed.
TESS I don't smoke.
TESS Don't sit --
DANNY They said I'd paid my debt to society.
TESS Funny, I never got a check.
TESS Danny smiles.
TESS Tess stares daggers.
TESS DANNY You can't stay.
TESS DANNY It's good to see you.
DANNY You're not wearing your ring.
DANNY A beat.
TESS I sold it.
TESS And I don't have a husband.
TESS Or didn't you get the papers?
DANNY My last day inside.
TESS I told you I'd write.
TESS Danny reaches his hand (ringed) for hers (ringless), but she removes it from the table.
TESS Danny.
TESS Go.
TESS Now.
TESS Before...
DANNY Benedict?
DANNY She freezes: Danny knows.
DANNY He smiles: it's okay.
DANNY Then,
to a passing waiter:
DANNY Whiskey and -- (then one inch apart) -- whiskey.
TESS Danny...
DANNY You're doing a great job curating the museum.
DANNY She sighs, exasperated.
DANNY The Vermeer is quite good.
DANNY Simple but vibrant.
DANNY Although his work definitely fell off as he got older.
TESS Remind you of anyone?
TESS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TESS 1/8/01 69.
DANNY And I still get Monet and Manet confused.
DANNY Which one married his mistress?
TESS Monet.
DANNY Right.
DANNY Manet had syphilis.
TESS They also painted occasionally.
TESS A beat.
DANNY You don't know how many times I played this conversation out in my head the last two years.
TESS Did it always go this poorly?
DANNY Yes.
TESS Sounds frustrating.
DANNY You were never easy.
DANNY Okay.
DANNY I'll make this quick.
DANNY I came here for you.
DANNY I'm gonna get on with my life, and I want you with me.
TESS You're a thief and a liar.
DANNY I only lied about being a thief.
DANNY But I don't do that anymore.
TESS Steal?
DANNY Lie.
TESS I'm with someone now who doesn't have to make that kind of distinction.
TESS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TESS 03/20/01 70.
DANNY No, he's very clear on both.
TESS Nice.
TESS Work on that for two years, too?
DANNY Year and a half.
DANNY A light smile from Tess.
TESS Do you know what your problem is?
DANNY I only have one?
TESS You've met too many people like you.
TESS I'm with Terry now.
DANNY Does he make you laugh?
TESS He doesn't make me cry.
At the table, Saul bets heavily for the bank.
Benedict approaches, stands off to the right, watching.
HIGH ROLLER You don't want to get in the hole too heavy to this Benedict.
HIGH ROLLER A friend of mine once borrowed a hundred g's from the guy.
HIGH ROLLER Two months went by, Benedict hadn't heard from him, he calls my friend up, asks 'Where's my money?' I'll get to it when I get to it,' my friend says.
HIGH ROLLER Half hour later Benedict's in my friend's hotel room, dangling him off his 10th floor balcony by his feet.
HIGH ROLLER 'You gonna get to it now?'
HIGH ROLLER High Roller turns over a nine.
HIGH ROLLER Saul wins.
HIGH ROLLER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
HIGH ROLLER 03/20/01 70A.
FRANK Bank wins -- natural nine.
FRANK Benedict steps forward.
HIGH ROLLER Hiya, Terry.
BENEDICT Mr. Weintraub.
BENEDICT How's everything?
HIGH ROLLER Eh.
HIGH ROLLER They put too much grenadine in my Shirley Temple.
BENEDICT And here I thought you were drinking vodka.
BENEDICT Mr. Zerga.
SAUL Mr. Benedict.
SAUL I recognize you from the TV.
SAUL You know, nine casinos out of ten, owner comes up in the middle of the hand to ask me what I want.
SAUL I respect your waiting.
SAUL OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
SAUL 10/24/01 71.
BENEDICT You're the guest, sir.
SAUL And I have to impose on your hospitality.
SAUL Can you sit in for a hand?
BENEDICT I'd love to, Mr. Zerga, but the gaming board would feed me to my white tigers.
SAUL That's a shame.
SAUL You're the king of Vegas and you have to play craps in the alley.
BENEDICT No shame at all.
BENEDICT Reminds me of my youth.
CORNER - MOMENT LATER Benedict and Saul are huddled in a corner.
SAUL The fight is Saturday, is it not?
BENEDICT Yes.
BENEDICT I can get you seats...
SAUL No, no.
SAUL Hand-to-hand combat doesn't interest me.
SAUL I have a package arriving here Saturday evening.
SAUL A black briefcase, standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me.
BENEDICT I'd be happy to put it in the house safe for you.
SAUL The house safe is for brandy and grandmother's pearls.
SAUL I'm afraid I need something more secure.
BENEDICT I can assure you, the house safe is utterly...
SAUL I can assure you, Mr. Benedict, your generosity in this matter
will not go overlooked.
Now: what can you offer me besides the safe?
Saul's eyes are pure steel: he is not a man familiar with being denied.
And Benedict recognizes that fact.
TESS See, the kind of people you steal things from, they have insurance to compensate them.
TESS They get made whole again.
TESS I had to leave New York to get away from what happened.
TESS How do I get my five years back, Danny?
DANNY You can't.
DANNY But what you can do is not throw away another five years.
TESS You don't know anything about --
DANNY Listen, you don't love me anymore, you want to make a life with someone else?
DANNY Fine, I'll have to live with that.
DANNY But not him.
TESS Spoken like a true ex-husband.
DANNY I'm not joking, Tess.
TESS I'm not laughing.
TESS You have to admit there's a conflict of interest when you give me advice about my love life.
TESS Danny exhales and leans back.
TESS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TESS 1/8/01 73.
DANNY Yes.
DANNY But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
DANNY She looks at him, and maybe part of her knows that he isn't.
DANNY She looks down at his ring, somewhat wistful.
DANNY He sees her looking at it.
TESS Do you remember what I said to you when we first met?
DANNY You said: you better know what you're doing.
TESS Do you?
TESS Now?
TESS Because -- truly -- you should walk out the door if you don't.
DANNY I know what I'm doing.
BENEDICT What are you doing?
BENEDICT Terry Benedict is hovering over them, fresh from his meeting with Saul.
DANNY Catching up.
TESS Terry, meet my ex-husband...
DANNY Danny Ocean.
BENEDICT Mr. Ocean.
BENEDICT Forgive me for being late.
BENEDICT A guest required my attention.
TESS Danny was just walking through the restaurant and spotted me.
BENEDICT Is that right?
BENEDICT OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BENEDICT 1/8/01 74.
DANNY I was shocked myself.
DANNY Imagine the odds.
BENEDICT 'Of all the gin joints in all the world...'
BENEDICT You've been in prison until recently, isn't that right?
BENEDICT How does it feel to be out?
DANNY About the same.
DANNY Everything you want is still on the other side.
BENEDICT There's the human condition for you.
TESS Terry, Danny was just about to...
DANNY I just wanted to say hello.
DANNY For old time's sake.
BENEDICT Stay for a drink, if you like.
TESS He can't --
DANNY -- I can't.
DANNY An awkward silence.
DANNY Benedict takes Tess's hand in his.
BENEDICT Well, then I don't imagine we'll be seeing you again, Mr. Ocean.
DANNY You never know.
BENEDICT I know everything that happens in my hotels.
DANNY So I should put those towels back.
BENEDICT The towels you can keep.
BENEDICT OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BENEDICT 10/24/00 75.
DANNY Good seeing you, Tess.
TESS Take care, Danny.
TESS Danny goes.
TESS When he's out the door...
TESS I'm sorry --
BENEDICT Don't be.
MOVING WITH Danny as he exits, his fingers snapping, he saw the mist in Tess's eyes just now, he knows he's got a fighting chance with her, but what he does not know is...
...
Linus is tailing him, ten steps back.
He stops, glances back at the restaurant quizzically, then continues following Danny.
Nobody lights a match, this place is a powder keg.
Basher sits on his bed, surrounded by combustibles, whittling and polishing a plastic explosive into an emerald shape.
There's a KNOCK at the door...
MAID House cleaning.
BASHER Just jumping into the shower, can you come back later?
BASHER The maid moves on, on TV: A Reporter broadcasts live...
REPORTER (V.O.) We're here at the historic Paradiso Hotel and Casino, once the prize resort of Las Vegas, now seconds away from demolition...
REPORTER (V.O.) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
REPORTER (V.O.) 10/24/00 76.
Just down the block from the Terry Benedict Trinity stands (for a few remaining moments) the edifice of the Paradiso, Reuben Tishkoff's bankrupted hotel-casino.
A crowd has gathered to witness its destruction: Terry Benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face in the spotlight; Tess another, standing (near)by her man; Danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on his ex; and Linus, who keeps a steady bead on Danny.
REPORTER ...
REPORTER and here's Reuben Tishkoff, former owner of the Paradiso, come to bid farewell to his fabled resort and wish Terry Benedict all the best with his future plans for the property...
REPORTER Terry greets Reuben before the TV cameras and newspaper reporters, and everyone's smiling and shaking hands, but behind those smiles and under their breaths...
BENEDICT Good to see you.
REUBEN Go shit in your mouth.
REUBEN Tess, her eyes roaming the crowd, finds a pair staring back at her: Danny's.
REUBEN She holds his glance a moment -- long enough for both Linus and Benedict to notice -- before turning away, to...
REUBEN ...
REUBEN Benedict, who puts his public smile back on and steps up to a podium alongside MIKE TYSON and LENNOX LEWIS, and together they all put their hands on "the plunger" and Benedict leans into a microphone...
BENEDICT I hope there's as much dynamite in the Paradiso as there will be in this Saturday's fight.
BENEDICT ...
BENEDICT and -- WHOOMPH -- the PLUNGER comes down and -- write your own onomatopoeia here -- the PARADISO IMPLODES.
BENEDICT Reuben wipes a tear from his eye.
REUBEN G'bye, honey...
As the Paradiso crumbles outside his window, the lights and TV in his room flicker and go out.
BASHER Shit.
BASHER As he scrambles out the door, making sure to post a "Do Not Disturb" sign...
RUSTY (V.O.) Saturday day is yours.
RUSTY (V.O.) Do whatever you like with it.
FROM ABOVE, SLOWLY DESCENDING: Ten of our eleven (Basher is missing) surround the model of the three casinos.
Rusty leads everyone in a run-down of the heist...
RUSTY Call is at five-thirty.
RUSTY Makeup and costume.
RUSTY Saul's package arrives at seven-fifteen, and Linus grabs our codes.
RUSTY All goes well there and we're a go.
RUSTY Seven- thirty Virgil and Turk deliver Yen and we're committed.
RUSTY From that point, we have thirty minutes to blow the power or he suffocates.
RUSTY We DESCEND ONTO the miniature of the vault, then --
FROM ABOVE, DESCENDING STILL: This is the Real Deal.
The Bellagio vault.
A clock reads: 8:03.
RUSTY (V.O.) Once the electricity goes, all entry points to the vault and its elevator will automatically lock down for two minutes.
RUSTY (V.O.) That's when we make our move...
RUSTY (V.O.) Two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the vault's center and march out again, closing the thick metal door behind them.
RUSTY (V.O.) When the vault LOCKS CLICK...
RUSTY (V.O.) ...
RUSTY (V.O.) We STOP DESCENDING, just above the cash cart.
RUSTY (V.O.) There is silence for a spell, the lights flicker out, then...
RUSTY (V.O.) ...
RUSTY (V.O.) the false top of the cart springs open, revealing Yen within, folded neatly.
RUSTY (V.O.) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY (V.O.) 1/8/01 78.
He inhales deeply, then slowly unspools himself from the cash cart until, at last, he crouches atop it.
He takes in the room: vacant and silent.
Except for Rusty, who walks right by him, incongruously.
RUSTY Okay: they've put you in the middle of the room, far from everything.
RUSTY You have to get from here to the door without touching the floor.
RUSTY What do you do?
RUSTY A WIDER ANGLE reveals we're...
The Bellagio vault has been fully reproduced here, and what we've been watching has been a trial run.
Ten of the eleven (Turk and Virgil in guard costumes, Basher is still missing) watch from offstage, like a film crew watching a dress rehearsal.
FRANK Fin says he shorts it.
LIVINGSTON Make it a sawbuck.
LIVINGSTON From a dead squat, Yen leaps, hands first, from the cash cart to a ledge five yards away, and grips it safely with both hands without touching the floor.
LIVINGSTON From this position, he'll inch his way to a counter, then, to the door...
LIVINGSTON Frank pays up.
LIVINGSTON Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to see Basher, at last.
LIVINGSTON Sniffing the air, he double-takes -- Basher's covered head-to-toe in sewage.
BASHER We're in deep shit.
Linus hoses Basher off, his accent angry and thick as he spits out water and the story of his afternoon and if nobody understands a word he's saying, that's okay...
BASHER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BASHER 10/24/00 79.
BASHER The damn demo crew didn't use a coaxial lynch to back the mainline!
BASHER Onioned the mainframe couplet!
BASHER Reuben leans into Livingston...
REUBEN You understand any of this?
LIVINGSTON I'll explain later.
BASHER Blew the backup grid one by one!
BASHER Like dominoes!
DANNY Basher.
DANNY What happened?
A cabal of city engineers investigates subterranean fuse boxes, and Basher tails them, hiding near a waterfall of effluent.
BASHER (V.O.) They did exactly what I planned to do.
BASHER (V.O.) Only they did it by accident.
BASHER (V.O.) Now they know their weakness.
BASHER (V.O.) And they're fixing it.
BASHER (V.O.) An ECHOING FOOTSTEP draws the attention of the city engineers, and Basher retreats into the waterfall.
Basher towels off his hair...
DANNY So...
BASHER So unless we decide to do this job in Reno, we're screwed.
BASHER Danny rises and paces, frustrated.
BASHER He's come too far for things to go awry now.
BASHER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BASHER 10/24/00 80.
RUSTY We could --
DANNY By tomorrow?
DANNY Danny keeps pacing; Rusty hangs his head and thinks; Basher dries his hair.
BASHER We could use a pinch.
BASHER Danny stops; Rusty looks up.
DANNY What -- is a pinch?
Scientists demonstrate the pinch, a lithium wire in a glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator.
BASHER (V.O.) A pinch is the equivalent of a cardiac arrest for any broad-band electrical circuitry.
BASHER (V.O.) Or better yet: A pinch is a bomb...
BASHER (V.O.) but without the bomb.
BASHER (V.O.) Every time a nuclear weapon detonates, it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its vicinity.
BASHER (V.O.) That tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon destroys everything you might need power for anyway.
BASHER (V.O.) Now a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the headache of mass destruction and death.
BASHER (V.O.) So instead of Hiroshima, you get the Seventeenth Century.
RUSTY For how long?
BASHER About ten seconds.
BASHER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BASHER 1/8/01 81.
DANNY Could a pinch take out the power of an entire city?
DANNY Like, I don't...
BASHER Las Vegas?
BASHER But there's only one pinch in the world big enough to handle it.
BASHER Danny and Rusty trade a look: They have their answer.
DANNY Where?
BASHER Pasadena.
Headlights hit a sign: "Cal Tech.
HIGH-SECURITY AREA.
KEEP OUT."
A white VAN SHOOTS PAST it.
Turk and Virgil man the front seats as Danny, Basher, Yen and Linus huddle in the back.
Basher and Yen both prepare equipment for their raid: hooks and a rope for Yen, a small blowtorch and a drill for Basher.
DANNY You two ready?
DANNY They nod and, with Danny, start out the van's rear door.
DANNY Linus starts to follow but...
DANNY What are you doing?
LINUS Coming with you.
LINUS Danny smiles and shakes his head.
LINUS But...
LINUS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
LINUS 1/8/01 82.
The van door slams in his face.
Danny picks a lock, then he, Yen, and Basher disappear into the lab's interior.
Linus twiddles his thumbs, tired of being seated at the kids' table.
Meanwhile, up front, another Mensa meeting has been called to order...
VIRGIL Are you a man?
TURK Yes.
TURK Nineteen.
VIRGIL Are you alive?
TURK Yes.
TURK Eighteen.
VIRGIL Evel Knievel.
TURK Shit!
TURK Okay, your turn...
VIRGIL Co-sign squared over .0455.
TURK No.
TURK Co-sign squared over .0415.
VIRGIL .04-five-five.
TURK One-five.
VIRGIL You're so wrong.
TURK You don't know your string theory, bitch.
TURK OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TURK 1/8/01 83.
SAME SCENE - LATER After a spell of silence...
VIRGIL Mom told me she loves me more.
TURK She told me she was going to tell you that.
TURK Stop it.
VIRGIL Make me.
TURK Stop it.
VIRGIL Make me.
VIRGIL They can be heard WRESTLING.
VIRGIL Linus has had enough.
VIRGIL He sneaks out the van's back door without the Malloys hearing him.
Linus sulks along the laboratory's perimeter, finds the door Danny pick-locked, and disappears inside.
A moment passes.
A moment passes.
And the next door opens, and Danny, Basher, and Yen appear, pinch in hand -- they've succeeded.
They weave a path to the van...
Turk and Virgil are still wrestling as the trio appears.
Danny, Basher and Yen pile in the back...
DANNY We got it.
DANNY Let's go.
DANNY Turk floors it, and they're off.
DANNY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
DANNY 1/8/01 84.
DANNY Wait a minute.
DANNY Turk brakes, and they're not.
DANNY Where's Linus?
Everyone realizes: he's not here.
Just then:
SIRENS and ALARMS and lights come to life.
Uh-oh.
Danny spins to look out the back of the van, Basher by his side.
His eyes scan the compound, then:
DANNY There he is.
DANNY'S POV of the lab, and its beveled-glass stairwell.
DANNY'S POV Linus scrambles up its steps, a flight ahead of a duo of chasing guards.
DANNY'S POV As he ascends out of sight...
DANNY'S POV Danny shifts his focus to -
DANNY'S POV The other side of the building, and two more guards
arriving on the roof and moving toward the staircase: Linus will be trapped.
BACK TO SCENE Danny, Basher, and Yen squat side-by-side-by-side, watching all this.
BACK TO SCENE Yen makes a colorful observation about Linus's predicament; of course, no one understands it.
VIRGIL One of us should help him.
BASHER Then there'll be two of us who need saving.
DANNY He knows where we are.
DANNY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
DANNY 1/8/01 85.
DANNY'S POV Both sets of guards appear on the rooftop, and find no Linus between them -- he's disappeared.
TURK Where'd he go?
BACK TO SCENE Danny and Basher slowly turn: Turk and Virgil crouch inches behind them, wanting to spectate as well.
TURK What?
TURK Would you -- shouldn't someone be behind the wheel?
A second-story WINDOW EXPLODES as a desk chair flies through it, followed shortly by Linus who leaps onto a steel-mesh overhang running alongside the building.
DANNY Alright, back it up, back it up!
DANNY Virgil leaps into the driver's seat, shifts into reverse.
Linus runs along the overhang, then leaps down, onto the reversing van, and rolls along its roof and down its windshield.
DANNY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
DANNY 1/8/01 86.
THROUGH the windshield: Virgil jabs his thumb over his shoulder: get in the back.
DANNY C'mon, c'mon...
DANNY Linus scrambles back over the van, and Danny and Yen pull him in.
DANNY Virgil hits the gas for a quick getaway, but he does so before the rear doors are closed, and one of them slams shut right on Yen's hand -- CRUNCH!
YEN Ahhh!
131    INT. WHITE VAN                                                  131 as it hurtles away.
Basher tends to Yen, cradling his hand, and Danny stares down Linus, breathless.
DANNY I say stay in the van, you stay in the van, got it?
DANNY 'Cause you lose focus for one second in this game, and someone gets hurt.
LINUS I got it.
LINUS They continue staring daggers at one another as...
The van pulls away into the night...
JIM LAMPLEY (V.O.) It's fight night in Las Vegas...
Incoming lanes of the I-15 reflect bumper-to-bumper steel; planes in the air are stacked for five miles over the desert; even Gila monsters below seem Vegas-bound.
JIM LAMPLEY (V.O.) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
JIM LAMPLEY (V.O.) 1/8/01 87.
JIM LAMPLEY (V.O.) ...
JIM LAMPLEY (V.O.) people are flooding in from all over the country to see what has been dubbed the 'Fight to End All Fights'...
JIM LAMPLEY broadcasts live from a mobbed Strip.
JIM LAMPLEY ...
JIM LAMPLEY and even though it's still five hours 'til the opening bell, the energy here is fever-pitched.
Every table is in play, every seat filled.
The Bellagio's CASINO MANAGER (the one Linus spied with Benedict before) checks in with his watchers.
MANAGER How we doing?
Livingston has moved A/V operations into Lyman Zerga's suite.
As he scours the same images the watchers downstairs do, he eavesdrops on their communications through his headset.
WATCHER (V.O.) Cotton couldn't be taller.
Lost in the luxury his role dictates, Saul floats in a full-sized Jacuzzi and chews on a hundred dollar cigar; Reuben, meanwhile, paces the floor, nervously.
TISHKOFF Where are they?
TISHKOFF That's what I want to know.
TISHKOFF Where are they?
SAUL They'll be here.
TISHKOFF 'They'll be here.' Thanks a lot, Fidel.
Punching up a new set of views from the Eye In The Sky, Livingston thrusts forward, alarmed by one.
LIVINGSTON Yikes.
Rusty keeps watch on the hotel's side entrance.
He glances at his watch, then outside again as the white van arrives, dropping off only Linus and Danny, who slaps the van's roof before it pulls away.
As Danny and Linus enter the lobby, Rusty falls into step with them, exchanging a smile with Danny but not Linus, he still looks chastised from the car-trailer.
Riding up...
RUSTY You boys have a nice trip?
RUSTY Rusty, smiling, looks to Linus, glowering, then to Danny.
RUSTY Before Danny can explain the doors part at the Mirador Suite, where Livingston greets them urgently.
LIVINGSTON We have a problem.
A mug-shot of Danny, complete with vital information: height, weight, criminal history.
LIVINGSTON You've been red-flagged.
LIVINGSTON It means the moment you step on the casino floor, they'll be watching you.
LIVINGSTON Like hawks.
LIVINGSTON Hawks with video cameras.
DANNY This is a problem.
DANNY A pall falls over the room: this is more than a problem, this is disastrous.
DANNY Only SAUL dares make a noise, HUMMING and SPLASHING in the next room.
RUSTY Saul: time to get out.
SAUL It's time when I say it is.
RUSTY Now!
RUSTY We hear HIM JUMP-TO-IT out of the tub...
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 10/24/00 90.
SAUL I'm out.
RUSTY You have any idea how this happened?
RUSTY Before Danny can answer...
LINUS I do.
LINUS He's been chasing Benedict's woman.
LINUS Got into a real snarl with him two nights ago.
LINUS I was tailing you.
DANNY Who told you to do that?
DANNY Before Linus can answer...
RUSTY I did.
RUSTY I knew you couldn't leave Tess alone.
TISHKOFF Who's Tess?
DANNY My wife.
RUSTY Ex-wife.
SAUL Tess is here?
RUSTY I'm sorry.
RUSTY I didn't know if it would sting you, but it did.
RUSTY You're out, Danny.
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 10/24/00 91.
TISHKOFF He's out?!
RUSTY It's that or we shut down right now.
RUSTY His involvement puts us all at risk.
RUSTY Danny and Rusty face off, furious with each other.
DANNY This isn't your call.
RUSTY You made it my call.
RUSTY When you put her ahead of us.
RUSTY You made it mine.
DANNY This is my job.
RUSTY Not anymore.
RUSTY Danny stares daggers at Rusty.
RUSTY But he can see: everyone in the room is on Rusty's side.
RUSTY Defeated, he stalks out of the room, onto a balcony, but not without staring down Linus.
TISHKOFF But, but...
TISHKOFF he can't just be out.
TISHKOFF Who's gonna take his place?
TISHKOFF Rusty turns to Linus.
RUSTY Kid, you up for it?
RUSTY Linus's eyes drift to Danny outside -- whatever acrimony he felt before, he never meant to kick Danny off the job.
RUSTY He nods, half-cocksure/half-scared-pissless: he's up for it.
RUSTY Find everyone else.
RUSTY Let 'em know the change in plan.
RUSTY Curtain goes up at seven.
RUSTY Livingston exits.
RUSTY Everyone else in the room staggers about, like witnesses after an execution.
RUSTY Rusty steps out onto the balcony, perhaps to console Danny, but (as Linus watches them from inside) their words cannot be heard.
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 10/24/00 92.
SAUL Tess is with Benedict now?
SAUL She's too tall for him.
Tess, readying herself for the big evening, meets her own glance in a dressing mirror, then spots Benedict in its reflection, pacing the bedroom behind her.
BENEDICT Yes.
BENEDICT Yes.
BENEDICT No.
BENEDICT Very much no.
BENEDICT Then inform Mr. Levin he'll find a better view of the fight in front of his television.
BENEDICT Surely he must have H.B.O.
BENEDICT Hanging up, Benedict approaches her, puts his hands on her shoulders...
BENEDICT What are you thinking about?
TESS You.
TESS She smiles at him in the mirror.
TESS His glance in it, turns from her to himself.
Riding down, Terry Benedict checks his watch.
The elevator doors open and...
...
he steps onto his casino's floor, the king of Las Vegas.
The time is 7:00.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 93.
Benedict meets his casino Manager, according to schedule.
BENEDICT Any sign of Ocean?
MANAGER (WALSH) Not in a couple hours.
MANAGER (WALSH) You want him out?
MANAGER (WALSH) I can bounce him from the state for parole violation if you like.
BENEDICT Put a guy on him.
BENEDICT He's here for a reason.
BENEDICT I'd like to know what it is.
BENEDICT But if he comes anywhere near Tess, take it to the next level.
MANAGER Bruiser?
MANAGER Benedict nods, goes on his way.
Saul, as Lyman Zerga, stands ramrod straight, looking through sliding glass doors out at the valet station.
From behind, Terry Benedict approaches, two security guards walking half a pace behind him.
Saul spots him in the glass's reflection; he does not turn.
SAUL Mr. Benedict.
BENEDICT Mr. Zerga.
BENEDICT It's a very busy night for me.
BENEDICT Are we on schedule?
SAUL I have no reason to suspect otherwise.
SAUL My couriers should be here momentarily.
SAUL A beat as Benedict studies Saul.
BENEDICT It's a nice evening.
BENEDICT Shall we wait outside?
BENEDICT OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BENEDICT 10/24/00 94.
Benedict and Saul emerge, guards positioned around them.
TURK (V.O.) They're in position.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) Okay.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) We're a go.
A white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races up to the curb where Saul and Benedict wait.
Turk Malloy gets out the passenger's side, a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, as Virgil comes around from the driver's side, both of them dressed in their bodyguard suits.
TURK Mr. Zerga.
TURK A gift from Mr. Hesse.
TURK Turk extends the briefcase to Saul, so that they both clasp the handle, as Virgil produces a key, unlocks the cuff on Turk's wrist, transfers it to Saul's, clamps it shut, and hands Saul the key.
SAUL Thank you, Friedrich, Gunther.
SAUL He turns, nods to Benedict, and they retreat into the hotel, the security guards and Malloys flanking them.
Frank deals blackjack to a full table.
His eyes gaze past his players to Saul, the guards and Benedict passing by.
FRANK Lookin' like a bad night for the house.
FRANK MOVING WITH Benedict as he spies out of the corner of his eye Danny, lurking at a slot machine.
FRANK To one of his guards...
BENEDICT Find Mr. Walsh.
BENEDICT Tell him Mr.
BENEDICT Ocean's in the west slots.
BENEDICT OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BENEDICT 10/24/00 95.
The guard goes, and Benedict continues with Saul...
BENEDICT I'm afraid I can't allow my private security personnel inside the casino cages.
BENEDICT I hope you don't mind...
SAUL Of course not.
SAUL Saul turns to dismiss Virgil and Turk when...
SAUL ...
SAUL passing by, on his way to a sports betting window, an old RACETRACK DENIZEN happens past this cabal and, worse yet, happens to recognize Saul.
RACETRACK DENIZEN Saul?
RACETRACK DENIZEN Saul Bloom, is that you?
RACETRACK DENIZEN Saul does his best to ignore the man.
RACETRACK DENIZEN But even Benedict notices: this guy seems to know Lyman Zerga.
RACETRACK DENIZEN Saul, it's me.
RACETRACK DENIZEN Bucky Buchanan, remember?
RACETRACK DENIZEN From Saratoga.
RACETRACK DENIZEN At last Saul turns to face this man, with shark's eyes.
SAUL Friedrich, Gunther.
SAUL An order: dispose of this man.
SAUL Virgil and Turk pick up the Denizen by his elbows and haul him away.
SAUL Mr. Benedict...
SAUL Please: I have never enjoyed the touch of steel to my skin.
SAUL They proceed.
Danny sits in a row of octogenarians, all vacantly dropping $1 coins and pulling levers.
As he watches Saul and Benedict disappear into the cage...
SAUL OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
SAUL 10/24/00 96.
DING!
DING!
DING!
DING!
Four cherries.
Danny smiles, a big winner, but he's got bigger pots to win tonight.
He steers a neighboring senior citizen (blind as a bat) to his slot machine...
DANNY Pops, you won.
DANNY ...
DANNY then slips away.
Linus stands dressed in a sharp, conservative suit -- a far cry from the threadbare thief in Chicago.
Rusty circles him, inspecting.
RUSTY Where you gonna put your hands?
RUSTY Linus clasps them.
RUSTY No...
RUSTY Linus goes for his pockets.
RUSTY Not the pockets, either.
RUSTY And don't touch your tie.
RUSTY Look at me...
RUSTY Linus does.
RUSTY That how you gonna stand?
RUSTY Linus shifts his balance.
RUSTY Wrong again.
RUSTY I ask you a question, you have to think of the answer, where you gonna look?
RUSTY Linus looks down.
RUSTY Death.
RUSTY You look down, they know you're lying --
RUSTY Linus looks up.
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 1/8/01 97.
RUSTY -- and up they know you don't know the truth.
RUSTY Don't use three words when one will do, don't shift your eyes, look always at your mark but don't stare, be specific but not memorable, funny but don't make him laugh, he's gotta like you then forget you the moment you've left his sight, and for God's sakes whatever you do, don't under any circumstances --
LIVINGSTON Rust, can you come here a sec?
RUSTY Sure thing.
RUSTY Linus is left utterly bewildered, a thousand commandments to remember and fifteen minutes to remember them in.
Turk and Virgil's white van whips around a corner and shoots inside...
Of which, importantly, we never see the exterior, just an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror...
The white VAN SCREECHES to a halt inches from Basher who stands ready beside the pinch (and the now-gutted and dismantled mockup of the Bellagio vault) and faster than a NASCAR pit crew Basher, Turk and Virgil load the pinch into the white van's rear and before you can say "electromagnetic pulse" the VAN SCREECHES back out of the warehouse fully loaded.
The time is 7:16.
The room is empty save for a large table.
Saul places his briefcase on it, adjusts its numbered combination locks, and opens it.
Inside the case: five rows of glittering emeralds.
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 10/24/00 98.
BENEDICT They're very beautiful.
BENEDICT A gift.
BENEDICT Saul stares at him: none of your fucking business.
BENEDICT Can you lift them out, please?
BENEDICT Saul lifts the velvet tray out of the case, and Benedict pats down the case's interior.
BENEDICT Saul replaces the tray.
BENEDICT Alright, Mr. Zerga.
BENEDICT I acknowledge that the case does not contain any dangerous or illicit material.
BENEDICT I further agree to take custody of your case for a twenty-four hour period to store in our secured vault.
BENEDICT While I cannot permit you to accompany the case to the vault...
SAUL Why not?
BENEDICT Insurance, for one.
BENEDICT Security, another.
BENEDICT And I don't trust you.
BENEDICT There is a KNOCK at the door, and Walsh the casino manager enters.
BENEDICT He speaks low in Benedict's ear.
WALSH (MANAGER) I put two plainclothes on Ocean.
WALSH (MANAGER) He's at the keno bar now.
WALSH (MANAGER) Walsh nods, and Benedict turns back to Saul.
BENEDICT Mr. Zerga, this is Mr. Walsh, my casino manager.
BENEDICT If you will allow, he will arrange for your briefcase to be stored inside our vault while you watch on a security monitor.
BENEDICT Those are my terms.
BENEDICT Yes or no?
BENEDICT Saul and Benedict eyeball each other.
SAUL You leave me no choice.
SAUL Saul unlocks the cuff from his wrist.
SAUL OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
SAUL 10/24/00 98A.
The white van slows enough to unload Virgil and Turk, changed into waiter uniforms, and they hurry a table- clothed room service cart inside as Basher pulls away.
RISING FROM a spotless pair of wingtips shifting side-to- side, OVER hands flexing and stretching, UP TO Linus Caldwell.
He keeps an eye on the cage door, waiting for Benedict to appear, as he tries anything to shake out his nerves.
Then, from a discreet earpiece he wears, comes:
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) Deep breaths.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) You'll do fine.
LINUS Thanks.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) No sweat, kid.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) You're a rock.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) Now don't fuck up.
Linus's smile disappears as he continues to bounce.
There's a KNOCK at the door.
VOICE Room service.
VOICE Rusty checks through the peephole, then ushers in Turk and Virgil in costume with their room service cart.
TURK Who ordered the penne?
TURK Livingston raises a hand, and as Turk serves him his
plate, Virgil whips off the cart's tablecloth: underneath it's the false-lid cash cart.
Rusty turns to a corner.
RUSTY You ready?
RUSTY In it, Yen finishes bandaging his busted hand and nods.
Fat and Slim sit before their monitors, feet kicked up, as behind them Walsh, Benedict, and Saul enter.
WALSH This is our security center, where we oversee all gaming in the casino as well as our vault.
WALSH You'll be able to monitor your briefcase from here.
WALSH Walsh, finding Fat and Slim as they are, coughs; the two watchers leap immediately to their feet.
WALSH Benedict checks his watch.
SAUL Don't let me keep you.
BENEDICT Mr. Zerga...
BENEDICT And Benedict takes his leave...
RUSTY Linus...
RUSTY you're up.
Linus nods, shakes out his hands some more...
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 10/24/00 100.
LINUS Deep breaths, deep breaths.
LINUS ...
LINUS and here comes Benedict, exiting the cage just as his assistant arrives with his portfolio.
LINUS As he turns toward the restaurant...
LINUS Mr. Benedict...
BENEDICT Yes?
LINUS Sheldon Wills.
LINUS Nevada Gaming Commission.
LINUS Could I have two minutes of your time?
LINUS Benedict sighs -- his evening's been sidetracked enough already -- but...
BENEDICT Of course.
BENEDICT Anything for the
Danny watches Benedict escort Linus toward the blackjack tables, unaware that TWO PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GOONS watch him from across the bar, and when he turns in their direction, they look away, acting incognito, but it's not them he's turning toward...
...
it's Tess, rounding a corner toward the restaurant.
Danny jumps to his feet, throws a tip on the bar, and goes.
The time is 7:27.
Yen tucks himself into the cash cart's hidden compartment with a slim oxygen tank for company.
Meanwhile, Rusty drills Virgil and Turk...
RUSTY Okay: when do you make the deposit?
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 10/24/00 101.
TURK Not until we get your signal.
VIRGIL Hey.
VIRGIL What do we look like: a couple of peckerwood jackasses or something?
VIRGIL No one responds.
RUSTY Amazing: how's it feel?
RUSTY You alright?
RUSTY Want something to read?
RUSTY Magazine?
RUSTY From the tangle of limbs, a middle finger protrudes to show Rusty what he can do with a magazine.
RUSTY Okay.
RUSTY I'm counting down.
RUSTY Thirty minutes of breathing time starts...
RUSTY now.
RUSTY On "now" a RUNNING CLOCK APPEARS ON-SCREEN, descending from 29:59.
RUSTY It will REMAIN there for the duration of the pre-pinch heist, jumping at times BETWEEN SCENES.
RUSTY Rusty seals Yen inside the cash cart, then gives the top a tug: it's shut tight.
RUSTY As Virgil redresses it with the tablecloth, Turk snatches back Livingston's penne on the way to the door.
LIVINGSTON You get no tip.
164   INT. CASINO FLOOR - 28:37                                        164 and counting.
MOVING WITH Benedict and Linus into the Pit Boss's station.
LINUS It only came to our attention this morning, Mr. Benedict.
LINUS Apparently he has a record longer than my arm.
BENEDICT If he is who you say he is.
BENEDICT Charlie.
BENEDICT Call over Ramon Escalante.
PIT BOSS Certainly, Mr. Benedict.
PIT BOSS Benedict and Linus wait, side-by-side.
PIT BOSS While Linus does his best to play it cool, Benedict dips into his portfolio.
An overhead view of Benedict as he pulls out the combination to the vault, reads it, then buries it in his jacket pocket.
RUSTY Did you make it out?
LIVINGSTON His head blocked the last two numbers.
LIVINGSTON We missed it, Linus.
LIVINGSTON You gotta grab the combination yourself.
Linus half-nods in response, and Benedict notices.
Suspicious of the young man, he decides to test him.
BENEDICT You new at the commission?
LINUS Been there about two years.
BENEDICT I know Hal Lindley over there.
BENEDICT You work with him at all?
LINUS (a pause; will he pass?)
LINUS Not since he died last year.
LINUS He passes.
LINUS The Pit Boss returns with Frank in tow.
BENEDICT Mr. Escalante.
BENEDICT Would you come with us, please?
FRANK What's this about?
FRANK OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
FRANK 10/24/00 103.
BENEDICT I think it's better if we talked off the floor.
BENEDICT Linus and Benedict lead Frank away.
BENEDICT As they pass an elevator...
BENEDICT ...
BENEDICT its doors open, revealing Turk and Virgil, dressed now as security guards, pushing out the false-lid cash cart.
BENEDICT They leave behind a pile of dishes, waiter uniforms, a tablecloth.
167   INT. RESTAURANT - 24:26                                              167 and counting.
A MAITRE D' scours his reservations list, then peers up to find Reuben Tishkoff approaching, on either side of him two gorgeous young women, all blonde hair and breasts and legs, women who wouldn't give Hefner the time of day.
MAITRE D' Good evening, Mr. Tishkoff.
TISHKOFF Good evening, Marcel.
TISHKOFF My nieces and I would like a table.
TISHKOFF Something quiet before the fight.
MAITRE D' I can put you at 19 in just a couple minutes.
TISHKOFF Quick as you can.
TISHKOFF The meter's running here.
TISHKOFF The Maitre d' turns to his next customer: Tess.
TISHKOFF She, of course, merits a table instantly.
MAITRE D' Good evening, Miss Ocean.
MAITRE D' Right this way...
MAITRE D' Reuben can't help but stare as Tess passes by.
MAITRE D' His eyes linger a little too long and a little too low...
VOICE Hey...
VOICE Reuben pivots; it's Danny, and he strolls past Reuben and his lady friends and into the restaurant...
VOICE OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
VOICE 10/24/00 104.
DANNY Try to keep your tongue in your mouth.
TISHKOFF Yeah, pal, well only if you take your thumb out of your...
TISHKOFF ...
TISHKOFF Reuben gets brushed from behind by the two Plainclothes Goons following Danny.
TISHKOFF Hey: you have any idea who I think I am?
Just as she's sitting, Danny approaches.
She goes straight at him, apoplectic.
TESS Danny: No.
DANNY I'll just be a moment.
TESS I'm having you thrown out of here.
TESS She starts past him; he grabs her arm to keep her, and she wheels on him.
TESS You're up to something, Danny.
TESS What?
TESS And don't say you came here for me.
TESS You're pulling a job, aren't you?
DANNY Tess...
TESS Well, know this: no matter what it is, you won't win me back.
TESS I can't afford it.
DANNY I just came to say good-bye.
DANNY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
DANNY 10/24/00 105.
This surprises Tess, and, truth be told, saddens her; she studies him a moment, unsure of what to say.
TESS Oh...
TESS then...
TESS good-bye.
DANNY Good-bye.
DANNY Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then gently kisses it...
DANNY Be good.
DANNY Danny leaves her.
DANNY Tess watches him go.
TESS Good-bye, Danny.
Danny runs smack into the Plainclothes Goons.
PLAINCLOTHES GOON #1 Mr. Ocean.
PLAINCLOTHES GOON #1 Mr. Benedict would like to see you.
DANNY I thought he might.
DANNY The Plainclothes Goons escort Danny away, right past Reuben who frowns, concerned.
Frank stands at attention before Linus and Benedict.
Linus, straddling a desk, takes a beeper off his belt when it pinches him.
Benedict checks his watch: the fight's opening bell is growing closer and closer.
LINUS Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Escalante.
LINUS Or should I call you Mr. Catton?
LINUS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
LINUS 10/24/00 105A.
Frank bristles, tries not to let it show.
Linus pulls out a Xeroxed mug shot and bio of him.
LINUS You are Frank Catton?
LINUS Formerly of the Tropicana, the Desert Inn and the New York State penitentiary system?
LINUS (CONT'D) Your silence suggests you don't refute that.
LINUS (CONT'D) Mr. Benedict, I'm afraid you've been employing an ex-convict.
LINUS (CONT'D) As you know, the N.G.C. strictly forbids...
FRANK Goddamn cracker...
LINUS Pardon me.
FRANK You heard me.
FRANK Just 'cause a black man tries to earn a decent wage in this state...
LINUS That has nothing to do with...
FRANK ...
FRANK some cracker cowboy like you's gotta kick him out on the street.
FRANK Want me to jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton, won't let me deal cards, might as well call it whitejack.
LINUS I resent your implication that race has anything to do with this.
LINUS Now, as I was saying, the Nevada Gaming Commission strictly forbids the employment of the colored...
LINUS ...
LINUS I mean...
LINUS That does it: Frank attacks Linus, lunging at the man, and as Benedict steps in to separate the two...
LINUS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
LINUS 3/30/01 107.
...
Linus's hand dips into his tuxedo jacket and withdraws the vault combination.
FRANK Okay, okay, I'm cool.
BENEDICT You alright?
LINUS Yeah.
RUSTY He's got it.
RUSTY Virgil, Turk: deliver your package.
Two guards stand sentry outside the cage door.
Virgil and Turk move up with their cash cart, and when Virgil reaches for his keycard...
it's gone.
VIRGIL Aw, I think...
VIRGIL Jesus.
VIRGIL I lost my card.
VIRGIL The guards frown at him.
VIRGIL A SECURITY OFFICER approaches.
SECURITY OFFICER What's going on here?
VIRGIL I think...
VIRGIL Jesus!
VIRGIL I lost my keycard.
SECURITY OFFICER Okay.
SECURITY OFFICER Leave the cart.
SECURITY OFFICER Go find it.
SECURITY OFFICER Take this cart inside.
SECURITY OFFICER The sentry nods, swipes his keycard, and enters with the cash cart.
SECURITY OFFICER Turk and Virgil hesitate a moment to watch it enter, then hurry off.
SECURITY OFFICER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
SECURITY OFFICER 1/8/01 108.
On a monitor: The sentry pushes the cart down a cage corridor.
On another: Saul's briefcase is escorted by another guard to the vault elevator.
On another: Danny is escorted inside the cage by the Plainclothes Goons.
WALSH There it is now.
SAUL Wonderful.
ON MONITORS The yen-filled cash cart joins Saul's briefcase on the elevator.
ON MONITORS PULL OUT to...
RUSTY That's my cue.
RUSTY Give Basher the go.
LIVINGSTON Bash, what's your status?
175   EXT. BELLAGIO PARKING LOT - MOVING WITH BASHER - NIGHT          175 driving the white van, listening to a books-on-tape of Jane Eyre.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) Bash!
BASHER No need to yell.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) What's your status?
BASHER I'm there.
BASHER And he SCREECHES to a halt on the parking structure's top level.
BASHER Vegas can be seen in every direction.

176   INT. CAGE/HALLWAY - 08:36                                        176 and counting.
Benedict exits the casino Manager's office with Linus and Frank.
Benedict hails two GUARDS...
BENEDICT Please show this man off the premises.
BENEDICT Don't step foot in my casino again.
FRANK Cracker.
FRANK Benedict checks his watch again: he's really running late.
BENEDICT Mr. Wills, if you don't mind...
BENEDICT Mr. Wills?
LINUS Of course.
LINUS They start toward the exit.
LINUS But halfway there...
LINUS My beeper.
LINUS I'm sorry.
LINUS I forgot it.
LINUS Benedict hesitates: He's in an enormous hurry now, he's behind schedule -- he hates being behind schedule -- but leaving even a member of the Gaming Commission alone in his cage is a security risk.
LINUS One glace at the cameras all about and he decides to risk it.
BENEDICT You know how to get back out?
LINUS Of course.
LINUS Enjoy the fight.
BENEDICT Thank you.
BENEDICT Linus smiles after him, withdrawing the page of combinations he lifted off the man.
BENEDICT OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BENEDICT 10/24/00 110.
177   EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - 06:47                                      177 and counting.
The Guards show Frank out.
Frank tries to tip them...
FRANK Thanks, fellas.
FRANK ...
FRANK but they snarl at him before returning inside.
FRANK Frank smiles and goes on his way, his job complete.
Danny sits opposite two Plainclothes Goons in absolute silence, waiting.
DANNY How much longer do you think Mr.
DANNY Benedict will be?
GOON #1 Just a few minutes more.
GOON #1 He scans the room.
DANNY No cameras in this room, huh?
DANNY Don't want anyone seeing what happens here?
DANNY The Goons say nothing.
DANNY Danny checks his watch.
DANNY He's not coming, is he?
DANNY The Goons look at each other; Danny has called their bluff.
DANNY Who is?
There's a KNOCK at the door, and the Goons smile: Danny's about to find out who.
One Goon rises to usher in...
...
the BRUISER, come to beat the shit out of Danny Ocean.
The guy's at least six-six, three hundred pounds, but it's not his size that draws attention, it's his teeth...
DANNY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
DANNY 10/24/00 111.
...
or the lack thereof; the Bruiser doesn't hold a single incisor, molar or bicuspid in his mouth.
Gum city.
And there's something really terrifying about the sight.
DANNY I guess Mr. Benedict didn't like me talking to his girl.
DANNY The Goons shake their heads.
DANNY Danny smiles at the Bruiser, and the Bruiser snarls back, showing off those gums.
DANNY He rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a hole in this man.
DANNY The Goons head for the door.
GOON #1 We're gonna step outside now.
GOON #1 Leave you two alone to talk things over.
GOON #1 The Goons exit.
GOON #1 Danny and the Bruiser face off.
GOON #1 And as Danny opens his mouth to speak, Bruiser's fist flashes out and knocks him down.
GOON #1 Danny rises, wiping a little blood from his lip.
DANNY Jesus, Bruiser, not 'til later.
BRUISER Sorry, Danny.
BRUISER I -- I forgot.
DANNY S'okay.
DANNY How's the wife?
BRUISER Pregnant again.
DANNY Then we better get to work.
Standing guard outside, the Goons hear PUNCHES and GROANS from inside as...
...
Danny climbs onto Bruiser's shoulders and pushes through the ceiling rafters, groaning every time Bruiser slaps his fist into his hand.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 112.
A guard wheels in the Yen-filled cash cart, parks it in a station next to its twin, then -- as an afterthought -- plants Saul's briefcase right on top if it -- clunk -- an unforeseen obstacle to Yen's escape.
LIVINGSTON Oh shit...
Saul witnesses this, too, and stifles a reaction.
WALSH Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?
SAUL Yes, I'm very satisfied.
WALSH Close it up.
WALSH On the monitor, the vault door closes, but Saul looks anything but satisfied.
WALSH He's sweaty, his mouth's so dry he can't swallow, and he keeps patting down his pockets for his Rolaids, without finding them.
FAT You alright, sir?
182    INT. CAGE/HALLWAY - MOVING WITH LINUS - 04:02                   182 as he circumspectly approaches the vault-elevator door, checking up and down hallways for guards.
On a monitor, Linus comes into view...
LIVINGSTON Almost there, kid.
...
and Saul spots him, but so does Fat...
LIVINGSTON OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
LIVINGSTON 1/8/01 112A.
FAT Who's that?
FAT ...
FAT and Saul can't handle the suspense: He grips his arm and groans and this is no ulcer problem, this is a full- fledged cardiac, and Walsh, Fat, and Slim all attend to him, their backs turned as...
...
Linus hurries to the elevator, punching Benedict's combination into a keypad.
The elevator doors open for him.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
10/24/00 113.
Livingston punches a few keys...
LIVINGSTON Going to video now.
As Saul and his heart attack hold the spotlight, a security monitor flips from a shot of Linus entering the elevator to a Livingston-fed videotape of an empty lift.
WALSH Call for a doctor.
Linus immediately reaches up to the elevator's ceiling, rips down its panel to reveal a trap door.
As he starts to push it open...
...
a hand yanks it free from above.
It's Danny.
DANNY You didn't really think I was gonna sit this one out, did you?
LINUS What, didn't you trust me?
DANNY I do now.
DANNY He reaches down and pulls Linus, wide-eyed, up to the roof of the elevator.
The boxers enter the ring before a full, cheering house.
Benedict and Tess find their ringside seats, a row in front of Reuben and his "nieces."
RING ANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen!!
Rusty approaches the sentry on duty at the cage door.
RUSTY Someone called for a doctor?
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 10/24/00 114.
Danny rips off his jacket and shirt to expose a rappelling line wrapped around his torso.
Linus does the same.
LINUS How'd you get here?
DANNY Crawlspace.
DANNY And I had to give away a couple mil.
LINUS But what about -- I mean, that whole thing with Rusty...
LINUS Danny just smiles at him.
Earlier that night, just after Rusty kicked Danny off the job.
As Linus watches from inside, deaf to their conversation, blind to their expressions, Danny and Rusty confer.
DANNY You think the kid bought it?
RUSTY Hell, I think Reuben bought it, and he knew we were screwing around.
RUSTY You sure about this?
DANNY Bobby Caldwell threw me into the pool first time.
DANNY Least I could do is give his kid a push.
LINUS Why'd you make me go through all this?
LINUS Why not just tell me?
DANNY Well, where's the fun in that?
DANNY C'mon: Yen's got about three minutes of air left.
DANNY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
DANNY 10/24/00 115.
Danny leads Linus down and around the elevator and side- by-side they crawl onto the bottom of the elevator, gripping the undercarriage of the lift to keep from falling.
Meanwhile, we DESCEND QUICKLY DOWN the shaft, just to illustrate how very high up they are.
Rusty, playing doctor, inspects Saul.
At the same time, he inspects a monitor: the vault door closing with the Yen-filled cash cart and Saul's briefcase inside.
Rusty stops, listens to Saul's chest, then drops his head...
RUSTY He's gone.
RUSTY Walsh, Fat and Slim all bow their heads.
RUSTY At the door, two paramedics arrive with a stretcher.
WALSH You're too late, guys.
WALSH He's dead.
WALSH The first paramedic turns to his partner and admonishes
him:
VIRGIL I told you to hurry.
As Danny and Linus work, affixing suction-cupped anchors to their rappelling lines...
DANNY Who do you like tonight?
LINUS Huh?
DANNY Tyson or Lewis.
DANNY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
DANNY 10/24/00 116.
LINUS The fight...?
LINUS Lewis.
LINUS You like Tyson?
LINUS How strongly do you feel about it?
DANNY You looking for action?
LINUS I'd go in for a buck.
DANNY A buck it is.
DANNY And they're ready, poised at the top, looking into the abyss of an elevator shaft scattered with infrared sensors.
DANNY Livingston, we're set.
Rusty leads the "paramedics" out, with "dead" Saul on their gurney.
RUSTY Livingston, we're set.
LIVINGSTON Basher, we're set.
BASHER Just give me a minute.
BASHER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BASHER 10/24/00 117.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) We don't have a minute.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) Yen's gonna pass out in thirteen seconds.
BASHER Then give me thirteen seconds.
BASHER And Basher leaps down to hook up the pinch's wires to his van's engine.
The opening BELL RINGS -- round one.
The fighters break from their corners, feinting, jabbing...
Sitting ringside: Benedict looks at Tess and smiles as she winces at the first sharp blow.
Peering down into blackness, Danny and Linus prepare to let go any moment...
LINUS You ever rappelled before?
DANNY Never.
DANNY You?
LINUS Nope.
Basher finishes preparations.
BASHER Ready.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) Then hit it.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) Basher flips the switch.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) BOOM!
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) A quick TREMOR, then stillness.
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) He picks a point on the horizon, like Babe Ruth, and suddenly...
BASHER ...
BASHER One...
BASHER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BASHER 10/24/00 118.
199   HIGH ABOVE LAS VEGAS                                          199 whole blocks of lights disappear.
Casinos vanishing one- by-one.
FLAMINGO Every pink light vanishes.
BELLAGIO The fountain goes flaccid.
BASHER (V.O.) ...
BASHER (V.O.) two, three...
NEW YORK, NEW YORK The roller coaster stops dead; its passengers keep their arms raised, not sure what to do.
Both fighters move in simultaneously, sweat flying, both reach back, both going for the lights-out power cut to the jaw, when...
lights out.
BASHER (V.O.) ...
BASHER (V.O.) four, five...
Blip -- out go the infrared sensors.
DANNY Now!
DANNY And he and Linus lean forward and fall...
DOWN the elevator shaft.
Upside down, heads curled, and all we hear is the WHOOSH of their bodies in motion and the WHIRL of their CORDS
UNCOILING. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
UNCOILING. 10/24/00 119.
BASHER (V.O.) ...
BASHER (V.O.) six, seven.....
BASHER (V.O.) And now, looking STRAIGHT DOWN, the ground is rising up fast to meet them, a flat slab of gray concrete -- fifty feet, forty feet, thirty feet, twenty...
BASHER ...
BASHER eight, nine...
BASHER And SNAP -- the CORDS reach their full extension, and Danny and Linus bounce up, watching the floor recede.
LINUS Aaaaahhhhh!
BASHER ...
BASHER ten...
BASHER In the distance, lights come up again, first at the Mirage, then the MGM, gradually approaching...
Coming to a rest about ten feet from the floor, Danny quickly pulls a slim blade and slashes the two coils straight across.
He and Linus go tumbling to the floor as their drop lines recoil lightning fast to their elevator anchors, just before...
...
the infrared lights go back on-line.
The lights suddenly flash back on, revealing...
...
both fighters standing, and Tyson takes advantage of Lewis's disorientation and throws a sucker punch to his jaw.
Down goes Lewis, and up goes the crowd, roaring.
REF ...
REF One, two, three...
REF Benedict makes a quick survey; the arena is apoplectic from the blackout-knockout.
BENEDICT What the hell was that?
BENEDICT OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BENEDICT 1/8/01 120.
He cranes his neck, looking around the room, surveying his empire: he smells a rat.
His eyes fall on Reuben behind him, but Reuben just shrugs: "I didn't pull the plug."
BENEDICT The first goddamn round.
All the lights are back on, and Basher observes his achievement with great pride, his job complete.
BASHER Viva Las Vegas.
Linus and Danny arise from where they've fallen, clutching their heads and rubbing bruises.
Danny doesn't recover as quickly.
LINUS You alright?
DANNY No, but you're sweet to ask.
Lights are just flickering on here when...
...
the false lid of the cash cart thrust upward slightly.
It's Yen trying to get out, out of air and only now alert to Saul's heavy case resting atop him.
Livingston watches this on his monitors, just coming back on, his finger poised on a play button, as Frank comes in the door.
FRANK Are they in?
LIVINGSTON One second.
LIVINGSTON I thought you got kicked out?
LIVINGSTON OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
LIVINGSTON 1/8/01 121.
Frank shrugs.
Suddenly one of the monitors aligns itself, and Livingston presses play.
ON MONITOR A Overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor: the three Uzi guards stand idly, on duty.
ON MONITOR A And of the vault itself: Yen trying to get out of the cash cart.
ON MONITOR B Overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor: the three Uzi guards stand idly, on duty...
ON MONITOR B and in totally different positions.
ON MONITOR B Of the vault: no cash cart, but no Zerga briefcase, no Yen.
LIVINGSTON This tape's from last night.
LIVINGSTON Same guards, same...
LIVINGSTON His eyes fixing on Saul's briefcase pushing closer to the edge of the cash cart as Yen tries to free himself.
LIVINGSTON ...
LIVINGSTON shift.
The room is abuzz with activity.
The monitors here flicker back on, too, displaying the images from monitor B, but every watcher in the place is watching a table because...
...
the floor is going nuts.
After the ten seconds of darkness, all bets are off.
Some players doubled-down during the blackout, others miraculously halved their bets.
Consequently, Livingston's video feed switch goes unnoticed.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
1/8/01 122.
Danny and Linus pry open the elevator doors and squeeze out.
Just beyond the next doorway stand...
...
three UZI-CARRYING GUARDS, hovering outside the vault door and wondering what the hell just happened to the lights.
Yen continues to push up on the cash cart lid, and the more he pushes, the more Saul's briefcase slides off.
Yen stretches his hand out to grab it, but it's slid beyond his reach, to the edge of falling.
The Uzi-Carrying Guards turn their backs to the elevator shaft...
...
and Linus and Danny appear in the doorway; they both snap gas pellets and slide them into the corridor.
UZI-CARRYING GUARD #1 Jesus, Ron, was that you?
Linus and Danny wait, Danny silently mouthing a three- count before...
THUD, THUD, THUD.
They peer around the corridor to find...
All three Uzi-carrying guards lie unconscious on the ground.
Linus starts in, Danny holds him back...
DANNY Not yet.
DANNY Okay.
Danny and Linus enter, waving the faint remnants of the gas from their noses, tiptoeing past the guards' bodies.
LINUS You think Yen made it out okay?
DANNY I'm sure he's fine.
DANNY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
DANNY 1/8/01 122A.
Saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart, which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate this heist here and now.
Yen's hand stretches farther out to grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid until...
...
the briefcase tumbles toward the floor...
...
but not before Yen snags the handcuff chain attached to it and swings it round.
He's got it.
That threat over, he throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breath of his life.
Linus punches in the code for the door to the vault anteroom (the one he stole from Benedict).
He steps back as it slides open, revealing --
-- the vault door: it is sleek and immense and impregnable.
LINUS Jesus...
DANNY There's a Chinese man with a hundred sixty million dollars behind that door.
DANNY Let's get him out.
DANNY Danny takes a flat hand and slaps the door hard.
Yen now sits perched atop the cash cart, Saul's briefcase opened beside him (he has removed half of Lyman's "emeralds").
He hears the muffled Danny's slaps and he knows: it's time for his leap.
It's the same distance as the leap he made in the practice session, but this time he's only got one good hand.
Frank and Livingston watch nervously.
FRANK Fin says he shorts it.
LIVINGSTON No bet.
LIVINGSTON OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
LIVINGSTON 1/8/01 123.
Yen prepares for his leap, then springs...
...
across the room, to the ledge he must grab...
...
and he grabs it, but with only one hand he's slipping right away, and in a second he'll hit the sensored floor...
...
but, in a flash, he spins and splits his legs, propping himself up between two walls, inches above the floor.
An acrobatic wonder.
Frank and Livingston exhale.
LIVINGSTON Shit.
Danny, oblivious to this close call, slaps the door again.
A moment passes, then: Yen responds with a slap, too.
DANNY Okay.
As Basher enters, Livingston and Frank watch on a monitor Linus punching in the combination he stole from Benedict as Danny unravels a thin electrical wire connected to a detonator.
FRANK That's it?
LIVINGSTON There's still the five pins and the floor sensor.
LIVINGSTON Not much we can do about that from this side of the door.
LIVINGSTON But from this side...
LIVINGSTON He punches up the image of Yen in the vault.
BASHER ...
BASHER a little bit of Semtex should do the trick.
BASHER OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BASHER 1/8/01 124.
Yen sets the last of Lyman's emeralds against the vault door like a plastic explosive...
which, of course, it is.
He affixes a detonator receiver (the size of a golf ball pencil) to it, then slaps the door twice: all set.
Danny responds with two slaps of his own.
He steps back, detonator in hand, its wires attached to the vault door.
DANNY Counting down from twenty --
DANNY -- now.
Yen starts his retreat from the door, but gets yanked back.
His hand's bandage is caught on the door.
DANNY -- seventeen, sixteen, fifteen --
Yen tries to free himself, but he can't use his other hand lest he drop to the floor.
He tries gnawing at his bandage, which brings his face within inches of a plastic explosive.
DANNY -- eleven, ten, nine --
Livingston et al.
are alert to the danger.
LIVINGSTON Linus, can you read me?
LIVINGSTON Linus, do not blow the door, you're about to kill Yen.
LIVINGSTON OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
LIVINGSTON 1/8/01 124A.
Linus hears nothing through his earpiece.
LINUS -- five, four, three --
Yen finally frees himself just as --
-- ZOOMING INTO a plastic explosive --
DANNY -- one --
DANNY He presses his detonator.
DANNY Nothing.
Yen, still on the door, remains frozen.
Trembling.
A beat.
Then, he starts to creep back, leaping onto a money shelf, then another, as far from the explosives as he can get.
Danny presses it again.
Still nothing.
LINUS What's wrong?
DANNY I don't know.
DANNY Linus comes over to look.
LINUS You check the batteries?
LINUS Danny blanches.
LINUS Linus shoots him a look.
LINUS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
LINUS 1/8/01 124B.
Livingston, Frank, and Basher watch the monitors in disbelief...
Saul enters, alive and dressed as himself again.
His job is complete.
SAUL Everything going okay?
As Danny checks his batteries (the types with built-in power meters: both at zero percent), Linus ransacks the Uzi-carrying Guards' gear for replacements.
He finds AA's in their flashlights.
LINUS You know, you lose focus for one second in this game --
DANNY -- and someone gets hurt, yeah yeah.
DANNY I don't hear Yen complaining.
DANNY He takes the batteries, inserts them in his detonator, then slaps the door twice more.
Yen catches his breath on the far end of the room.
He hears the slap, rolls his eyes, and ducks out of the line of fire.
Danny presses the detonator.
The "EMERALDS" EXPLODE.
Several MUTED but powerful BLASTS.
Linus inches forward, almost dreading this moment, pauses...
DANNY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
DANNY 1/8/01 124C.
DANNY Do it.
DANNY Linus pulls...
DANNY and the door opens.
Danny and Linus enter.
Silence.
The cash carts have crumpled, and the vault gratings, blackened, have held.
DANNY Amazing?
DANNY Linus goes to one of the racks and tentatively opens it...
DANNY Yen pops up from within, his hair on end, looking like he just dropped out of a cyclone.
YEN Where the fuck you been?
Livingston, Frank, Saul, and Basher watch as the first wave of bills gets tossed onto the vault floor.
Smiles all around.
SAUL Ever been in love?
FRANK No, I guess not.
FRANK Not really.
SAUL This is better.
Rusty steps forward as people stream past him out of the fight arena.
He dials his cell phone, listens...
MOVING WITH Benedict and Tess, pushing their way out through the crowd.
A PHONE is RINGING nearby...
again and again...
BENEDICT You gonna answer it?
TESS I don't have a cell phone.
TESS They keep moving, but the RING pursues them.
TESS Finally, Benedict stops, pulls Tess's purse from her shoulder and opens it: inside, he finds a CELL PHONE, RINGING.
TESS It isn't mine.
BENEDICT See who's on the other end.
BENEDICT She takes the phone, activates it.
TESS Hello?
RUSTY (V.O.) May I have a word with Mr.
RUSTY (V.O.) Benedict, please?
RUSTY (V.O.) Tess looks up, confused.
TESS It's for you.
TESS Benedict takes the phone.
BENEDICT Who the hell is this?
ON RUSTY in the distance, at the arena's exit, unseen by Benedict or Tess, on the phone...
RUSTY The man who's robbing you.
Benedict enters, and fear enters with him.
And, of course, Tess.
As the room buzzes with activity, he keeps the cell phone pressed to his ear.
BENEDICT What the hell is going on down there in the vault?
FAT Nothing, sir.
FAT All normal.
BENEDICT Show me.
BENEDICT Fat points to the security-cam view of the vault corridor and vault -- Livingston's tape.
FAT All quiet.
BENEDICT I'm afraid you're mistaken.
Frank, Basher and Saul watch over Livingston's shoulder as this phone conversation is broadcast over a small speaker.
RUSTY (V.O.) You're watching your monitor?
RUSTY (V.O.) Okay, keep watching.
RUSTY (V.O.) Livingston punches in numbers...
ON FAT'S MONITOR New images suddenly appear.
ON FAT'S MONITOR Three masked men in the vault throw stacks of money onto the floor; the three Uzi Guards lie bound and unconscious in the corridor.
ON FAT'S MONITOR The security center, understandably, erupts in activity.
BENEDICT Jesus Christ...
BENEDICT OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BENEDICT 10/24/00 127.
Rusty strolls so casually there's no reason anyone passing would suspect he was doing more than ordering a pizza.
RUSTY (V.O.) In this town, your luck can change just that quickly.
BENEDICT Find out how much money we have down there.
BENEDICT Tess, amid all this chaos, is still curious: how did that cell phone get into her handbag?
BENEDICT And suddenly it hits her...
DANNY Good-bye.
DANNY Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then gently kisses it...
DANNY ...
DANNY as he slips the cell phone into her handbag, unnoticed.
BENEDICT Alright.
BENEDICT You've proved your point.
BENEDICT You've broken into my vault.
BENEDICT Congratulations: you're a dead man.
BENEDICT Tess leaves.
RUSTY (V.O.) Maybe.
BENEDICT May I ask: how do you expect to leave here, hmm?
BENEDICT Do you believe I'll simply allow you to parade bags full of my money out my casino doors?
A distance beyond Rusty, Tess exits the cages.
She stops, puzzling over what to do, happens to spot him.
RUSTY No.
RUSTY You're gonna carry it out for us.
BENEDICT And why would I do that?
RUSTY Take a closer look at your monitor...
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 10/24/00 128A.
Benedict does.
As the three masked men stuff money into large canvas bags and mark the bags with X's, another portion of cash remains untouched, booby-trapped.
RUSTY (V.O.) As your manager's probably reporting to you by now, you have a little over a hundred sixty million in your vault tonight.
RUSTY (V.O.) And, as if Rusty was in the room watching, Walsh approaches with the night's cash count: $163,156,759.
RUSTY (V.O.) You may notice: we're only packing up about half that.
RUSTY (V.O.) The other half we're leaving in your vault, booby-trapped, as a hostage.
RUSTY You let our eighty million go, and you get to keep your eighty.
RUSTY That's the deal.
RUSTY You try and stop us, we'll blow both cash loads.
He spins and -- gasp -- comes face-to-face with Tess.
She stares at him directly: she knows.
RUSTY Mr. Benedict: you can lose eighty million dollars secretly tonight or you can lose a hundred sixty million dollars publicly.
RUSTY It's your decision.
RUSTY He cups the phone.
RUSTY Hi.
Benedict cups his phone, too, and vents his rage.
He knows what he should do -- let the money go -- and he knows what he wants to do -- stop these sonsabitches.
He makes his choice...
BENEDICT Make the call.
BENEDICT Walsh grabs a phone, punches numbers...
VOICE (V.O.) 911.
VOICE (V.O.) Emergency response...
Livingston listens in on the call...
WALSH (V.O.) Hello, this is Mr. Walsh at the Bellagio.
WALSH We have an incident here...
BENEDICT Okay.
BENEDICT You have a deal.
BENEDICT OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
BENEDICT 10/24/00 130.
Tess and Rusty hold a stare as Rusty holds the phone.
TESS Where's Danny?
RUSTY He's fine.
RUSTY He wants you to go upstairs, and watch TV.
TESS He does?
BENEDICT (V.O.) You have a deal.
RUSTY It's alright, Tess.
RUSTY I promise.
RUSTY Good.
RUSTY Here's what you do.
RUSTY Five minutes from now, the men in the vault are going to deposit six bags in the vault elevator.
RUSTY Tess isn't sure what to do.
RUSTY As Rusty continues on the phone, she backs off, debating: can she blow the whistle on her ex?
242   INT. VAULT ELEVATOR - CLOSE ON SIX CANVAS BAGS                 242 each sealed tight, each marked with an X, loaded onto the vault elevator.
RUSTY (V.O.) If they meet anyone, we'll blow the money in the bags and the money in the vault.
A small cadre of guards await the arrival of the vault elevator.
Its doors open to reveal the six large canvas bags, each sealed tight, marked with an X.
RUSTY (V.O.) One minute after that, the elevator will rise to your cages.
RUSTY (V.O.) Six of your guards will pick up the bags and carry them out into the casino.
RUSTY (V.O.) Six guards do precisely that.
MOVING WITH Rusty PAST slot machines...
RUSTY If they take more than twenty seconds to reach the casino floor or if there's any indication a switch has been made, we'll blow the money in the vault and the money in the bags.
RUSTY A SLOT MACHINE RINGS behind him...
...
and Benedict hears it.
BENEDICT He's in the casino right now.
RUSTY (V.O.) Of course, I'm in the casino.
RUSTY (V.O.) In fact, I'm staying in your hotel.
And I have two words for you: mini-bar.
Now as soon as your guards hit the casino floor...
The six guards appear from the cage door, carrying six canvas bags marked with X's; Bellagio security escorts them from the building.
RUSTY (V.O.) ...
RUSTY (V.O.) a white unmarked van is going to pull up in your valet station.
The white VAN (now clean of the "Nevada Telecom" sign) IDLES before the Bellagio, its windows tinted, the driver's identity inscrutable.
It is swarmed by security, but they maintain a wide perimeter.
RUSTY (V.O.) Your guards will load the bags into the van's rear.
RUSTY (V.O.) If anyone so much as approaches the driver's door, we blow everything.
RUSTY (V.O.) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY (V.O.) 10/24/00 132.
The guards carry out the money and load it into the van's rear.
There, they find a video camera mounted within the back seat of the van monitoring them.
Still they cannot catch a glimpse of the driver.
They close the van doors.
The white van departs the valet station in front, clandestinely shadowed by five sedans.
Meanwhile, behind the casino, a SWAT van arrives and unloads its squad.
BENEDICT (V.O.) Now what?
RUSTY (V.O.) Now, when I get word that the van hasn't been followed, that the money is secure, my men will exit the building, and once their safety is confirmed, you'll get your vault back.
Walsh mouths to Benedict: "SWAT team is here."
Benedict nods and throws him a thumbs-up.
BENEDICT Sir, I have complied with your every request, would you agree?
RUSTY (V.O.) I would.
BENEDICT Good.
BENEDICT Now I have one of my own.
RUSTY (V.O.) Yes?
BENEDICT Run and hide.
BENEDICT If you get picked up next week buying a $100,000 sports car in Newport Beach, I'll be supremely disappointed.
BENEDICT Because I want my people to find you.
BENEDICT And rest assured: when they do, they won't hand you over to the police.
BENEDICT Run and hide.
BENEDICT That's all I ask.
BENEDICT And during the above rant by Benedict, we view...

He hangs up.
WALSH Our guys say the van is headed toward McCarren Airport.
BENEDICT Get everyone in position.
BENEDICT I want my vault back before that van hits the tarmac.

McCARREN AIRPORT - NIGHT 262
As the white van arrives at a charter airline's entrance, the five sedans converge upon it, TIRES SCREECHING, Goons emerging, weapons drawn.
HEAD GOON Get out of the van, now!
HEAD GOON Now!
HEAD GOON No response within the van.
HEAD GOON The Head Goon signals and the others SHOOT the van's tires.
Slim investigates the Eye in the Sky's wiring.
Reaching deep into a mesh, he finds a foreign object: Livingston's "spider."
The vault elevator doors open and Terry Benedict makes his way into his smoke-filled vault corridor.
He passes the Uzi Guards, awake now and stumbling to the elevator with SWAT members' assistance, then arrives before his decimated vault: Anything within -- people, money, Lyman Zerga's emeralds -- could only have been destroyed.
OVER SWAT LEADER'S SHOULDER as he approaches Benedict.
SWAT LEADER Mr. Benedict...
BENEDICT Yes.
SWAT LEADER We couldn't find any survivors.
SWAT LEADER Or, I'm afraid, any of your money.

HEAD GOON An EMPLOYEE from the charter airline sticks his head out of his office door.
EMPLOYEE Hey, what's going on here?
EMPLOYEE Half-a-dozen firearms turn and point in his direction.
EMPLOYEE The Employee disappears back inside his office.
EMPLOYEE The Head Goon cautiously approaches the van, reaches for the driver's door, and yanks it open...
EMPLOYEE Inside: There is no driver.
EMPLOYEE Just a video camera mounted at eye-level.
EMPLOYEE The Head Goon cranes back his head, befuddled, when he notices for the first time (and maybe we do, too) an enormous antenna sprouting from the van's rear bumper.
EMPLOYEE The van suddenly lurches.
266   SHORT DISTANCE AWAY - CLOSE ON REMOTE CONTROL                   266 complete with a tiny video monitor (displaying the van driver's POV) and a steering mechanism -- it's a near- replica of the one Virgil Malloy used in the monster truck drag race against his brother.
And Virgil's using it now, too, as he sits next to Reuben Tishkoff in one of Reuben's Rolls and watches the Goons scramble back from the flat-tired van.
TISHKOFF Enough monkey business.
TISHKOFF Virgil brings the van to a stop, then readies a distinctive red button on his remote.
As the Head Goon reaches for the rear door, his hand inches away when...
...
BARROOOOM!
The door EXPLODES open!
Knocked on his ass, the Head Goon watches as the canvas "X" bags within burn to cinders.
He does, however, happen to notice one burning shred of paper dislodged from a bag: It's a promotional flier for a call girl service.

Benedict steps over the scattered remains of his vault.
He picks up a fragment of a cash cart, burnt to a crisp, then lets it drop.
WALSH (V.O.) Mr. Benedict...
BENEDICT Yes?
WALSH (V.O.) They took the van.
BENEDICT And?
WALSH (V.O.) And they blew up the bags, sir.
BENEDICT Shit.
WALSH (V.O.) Sir...
WALSH (V.O.) sir...
BENEDICT What, Walsh?
WALSH (V.O.) They say it doesn't look like there was any money in the bags, sir.
BENEDICT What?!
WALSH (V.O.) They say the bags were filled with fliers.
WALSH (V.O.) For hookers.
BENEDICT What do you mean there was no money in the bags?
WALSH (V.O.) That's what they said, sir.
WALSH (V.O.) I don't understand it: we both saw them putting money inside those bags.
Benedict stops cold.
He stares up at a wall where an engraved sign reading "Bellagio" has been smoke-stained.
BENEDICT Walsh, cue up the tape of the robbery.
Walsh stands before several monitors as Slim cues up the "masked men robbing the vault" image of a few minutes ago beside the present image of Benedict staring at the vault wall.
BENEDICT (V.O.) Does it say 'Bellagio' on the south wall of the vault?
BENEDICT (V.O.) In the masked-men image it does not, in fact, say "Bellagio" there.
WALSH No, sir.
WALSH It doesn't.
WALSH I -- I don't understand...
Benedict exhales.
BENEDICT We had that installed on Tuesday.
BENEDICT The image we saw of the men robbing us was a tape.
WALSH (V.O.) What?
BENEDICT Someone built a double of my vault, then made a tape of them robbing it.
BENEDICT When we saw them putting money in those bags, that wasn't actually happening.
Walsh's jaw drops as he watches the tape again.
WALSH Then, sir...

No one is hurt.
Nor is the money, stacked neatly in a corridor, ready to be packed into the phony SWAT team bags, body armor, etc.
The SWAT team exits and boards the second vehicle Turk and Virgil have been working on all this time, the one in the warehouse with an air freshener hanging from its rearview mirror: it's a replica of a SWAT van.
Turk takes the wheel as the others jump in the back.
Rusty flips open another cell phone...

Bruiser throws a mean left hook across Danny's face as the door swings open and Benedict steps in.
Bruiser sees him and steps away, toweling off his bloodied knuckles.
Benedict studies Danny: the man is a bloody mess, head rolling, eyes puffed up.
BENEDICT Wake him up.
BENEDICT The Goons step in, slap Danny alert.
BENEDICT At last, Danny recognizes Benedict in the room.

DANNY Benedict keeps his cool.
BENEDICT Did you have a hand in this?
BENEDICT Did you?
DANNY Did I have a hand in what?
DANNY Benedict scrutinizes Danny: Is he bluffing?
DANNY He looks at Bruiser, then Danny again, and decides: no.
BENEDICT Get him out of here.
BENEDICT As the Goons scoop him up and drag him out, Danny catches Bruiser's eye for just a moment.

DANNY What would you say if I told you you could get your money back...
DANNY ...
DANNY if you gave up Tess?
DANNY What would you say?

DANNY Well, that's very interesting...
DANNY ...
DANNY but I didn't have anything to do with it.
DANNY He grins.
DANNY Benedict sinks.
BENEDICT Escort Mr. Ocean to the exit.
BENEDICT And contact the police.
BENEDICT I would imagine Mr. Ocean is in violation of his parole.
The Goons haul Danny out.
Tess has left, heartbeats ago: the room's door is just closing.
WALSH Maybe we should have held him.
BENEDICT No.
BENEDICT Follow him.
BENEDICT Everywhere.
Benedict exits.
Takes in his casino.
It's been a bad night: he's down a hundred fifty million.
He starts for...
As he arrives, the elevator doors open and Tess steps out.
She breezes right past him.
BENEDICT Tess...
BENEDICT Tess?
TESS You of all people should know, Terry: in your hotel, there's always someone watching.
TESS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TESS 1/8/01 145.
She keeps going.
Benedict, now down a hundred fifty million and one woman, boards the elevator.
Its doors close on him.
The SWAT van rounds a corner and ducks inside the warehouse.
Three-and-a-half seconds pass.
And the eight SWAT members reappear, now all in suits, perfectly pressed, and with grins on their faces and change in their pockets, they begin their victory stroll, single-file and sloppy...
right down the...
Turk, Livingston, Frank, Basher, Yen, Saul, Linus and Rusty march down the strip single-file, and when they come to an intersection...
...
Virgil and Reuben, also in suits, fall into stride for a victory lap in front of the Bellagio fountains.
Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into different hotels or grabbing cabs, until there are only two left: Rusty and Linus.
They take each other in, shake hands, and part.
Tess exits, searching for Danny.
She rounds the building to...
Where a LVPD squad car has just arrived to take goon-held Danny away.
She runs toward it.
TESS Wait!
TESS They do.
TESS As Danny is handcuffed and prepared for loading in the back, he and Tess hold each other's glance.
TESS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TESS 1/8/01 145A.
TESS Danny...
TESS I'm sorry.
DANNY I knew what I was doing.
DANNY A beat.
TESS I didn't.
TESS OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
TESS 10/24/00 146.
A cop lowers Danny's head as he directs him into his seat.
TESS How long will you be?
DANNY Three to six months, I should think.
DANNY The squad car door closes him in and Tess stands vigil as it pulls away.
Rusty watches Danny being driven back to prison, too.
SUPERIMPOSE THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER. The great metal gate opens once more, revealing Danny Ocean in its frame again, ready for release.
SUPERIMPOSE THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER. He looks forward -- no one's there to greet him, and the view of New Jersey looks no brighter than it did before.
SUPERIMPOSE THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER. He takes his first step into free America...
SUPERIMPOSE THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER. ...
SUPERIMPOSE THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER. to discover Rusty leaning against the prison wall.
SUPERIMPOSE THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER. Beyond him sits his second-hand Mercedes from L.A.
RUSTY Looking for someone?
DANNY Thirteen million and you drive that piece of shit cross country to pick me up?
RUSTY Hello to you, too.
RUSTY They shakes hands.
RUSTY Rusty looks Danny over.
RUSTY Your hair's grayer.
DANNY Your eyes got closer together.
DANNY How's life?
RUSTY Life...
RUSTY is a roomful of pillows.
RUSTY C'mon...
RUSTY MOVING WITH Danny and Rusty toward the Mercedes, together again.
RUSTY Where do you want to go first?
DANNY To a phone.
DANNY Rusty had anticipated this.
RUSTY I stopped and picked up your personal effects, put them in the back seat.
DANNY My what?
DANNY Danny gets to the passenger door and looks in to see Tess sitting in the back.
DANNY She smiles at him.
DANNY I'm not sure these belong to me.
TESS Sure they do.
TESS Danny and Rusty get in.
TESS Danny kisses Tess.
TESS Rusty STARTS the CAR.
DANNY We need to find Rusty a girl.
RUSTY There's a women's prison just down the road...
RUSTY OCEAN'S 11 - Rev.
RUSTY 1/8/01 148.
He drives off.
In the back, Danny takes Tess's hand in his.
Notices a silver wedding band on it.
DANNY You said you sold this.
TESS That's what I said.
DANNY Liar.
TESS Thief.
TESS As they drive away...
TESS ...
TESS another car STARTS its ENGINE begins to follow.
TESS At the wheel: Benedict's goons.
