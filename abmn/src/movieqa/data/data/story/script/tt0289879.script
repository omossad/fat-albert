"THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT"
Screenplay by
J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress
SHOOTING DRAFT
EVAN, 20, good-looking but with dark haunted eyes, frantically hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office.
His face and chest are covered in blood.
He holds his forehead in pain.
FLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting for him.
ALARMS SOUND.
GUARDS are heard shouting to each other.
Evan grabs a cardboard box and hides under a doctor's desk.
He grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand.
EVAN If anyone finds this, then I guess my plan didn't work and I'm already dead...
He takes a deep breath.
EVAN But if I can just go back to the beginning of all this, I still might be able to save her.
Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing...
ANDREA TREBORN, twenty-five, an attractive pregnant woman strapped to a gurney, is rolled down a busy hospital corridor.
She is clearly ready to give birth, and as she flails her arms, she knocks another patient's IV bottle into the wall.
A tearful Andrea holds newborn EVAN in her hands.
Smiling Andrea holds baby Evan up to the camera, then places him in a crib.
A playground.
Evan's father, JASON (23), puts a 1-year old on a slide.
A birthday party for LENNY, 5, a chubby kid with only a few friends.
Evan, now 5, is gently prodded by Andrea toward KAYLEIGH, 5, a quiet sweet-looking girl with beautiful hair.
Evan clumsily shakes her hand and she quickly leans over and kisses his cheek.
He blushes and runs to hug his mother's leg.
In the driveway, 7-year old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky cocker spaniel puppy.
Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on the carburetor of a Toyota Celica.
Evan pets the dog as he watches his mother work.
ANDREA Okay, okay...
ANDREA what now?
Evan quickly eyes the situation and grabs the 5/16" wrench from the toolbox.
EVAN We're gonna be late again.
ANDREA When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
EVAN We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Evan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt.
EVAN Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
ANDREA Thanks.
ANDREA Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
The carburetor will not set properly.
She bangs on it with the wrench.
ANDREA Darn it!
EVAN Um...
EVAN can dad come this time?
ANDREA You know the answer to that.
EVAN Can't he come out for one day?
ANDREA We've been over this a hundred times.
ANDREA It's too dangerous for him.
EVAN But Lenny said that his dad's coming...
EVAN and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Andrea hands the wrench to Evan.
ANDREA Here, Ev...
ANDREA Finish this up for me.
Evan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb back together.
Andrea, meanwhile, strips off her coveralls, revealing a spotless nurse's uniform underneath.
EVAN All the dads are gonna be there.
ANDREA I get the point, kiddo.
ANDREA But I'm not so bad, am I?
EVAN No.
ANDREA Good.
ANDREA Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
Evan, disappointed, passes the wrench back to Andrea.
EVAN Done.
EVAN Try it.
Andrea gets behind the wheel.
She turns the ignition and the engine roars to life.
Evan wears a proud smile.
ANDREA You're amazing, kiddo.
Andrea races through the school zone and heads for the main doors.
Evan's already got the car door open and his foot on the ground by the time the car skids to a halt.
Andrea checks her watch.
ANDREA Okay have a great day I love you I'll pick you up later gotta go...
Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school.
As Andrea pulls away, MRS.
BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window.
MRS. BOSWELL Mrs. Treborn!
MRS. BOSWELL I need to speak with you!
ANDREA I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight?
ANDREA I'm already late for work --
Mrs. Boswell's morbid expression stops Andrea.
MRS. BOSWELL I think you really need to see this.
The classroom is filled with screaming, running children.
Mrs. Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year old kid who swings a whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid.
Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell, but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, sweet-looking girl.
Mrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk.
MRS. BOSWELL I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
ANDREA What is it?
MRS. BOSWELL Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up.
MRS. BOSWELL Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
Mrs. Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls out a drawing.
Andrea turns to stone when she sees it.
ANDREA I don't understand...
ANDREA Evan did this?
The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies.
It's extremely sophisticated for a seven-year old.
Some of the corpses have been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically correct.
Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, and struggles to control her concern.
ANDREA Thank you for showing it to me first.
ANDREA I'll...
ANDREA I'll take care of it.
ANDREA Can I have the picture?
MRS. BOSWELL Of course.
MRS. BOSWELL There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn.
MRS. BOSWELL And I feel bad for mentioning it...
ANDREA What?
MRS. BOSWELL When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
Andrea is visibly shaken now.
ANDREA I have to go.
Andrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot even start the car.
The children hang artwork on the walls in prep for Parent's Night.
Each child has a picture of his or her family made from colored construction paper and macaroni.
Evan's picture (no longer sophisticated) depicts his mother, Crockett and himself on a green hill.
Tommy and Kayleigh's pictures each show two kids and a single father.
And their 'mother' is stuck to the far end of page.
Lenny beams as he pins-up his picture of an ideal nuclear family.
He looks at Tommy's picture and is confused.
LENNY You put the mommy too far away.
LENNY Mrs.
LENNY Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
TOMMY You're such a retard!
KAYLEIGH Mommy lives far away but she comes and visits.
LENNY If I'm retarded, why didn't my mommy move away from me?
Tommy gets upset.
He swipes his hand down Lenny's picture and his macaroni "mother" crumbles to the floor.
Lenny begins to cry.
EVAN Hey, what'd you do that for?
TOMMY Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Evan takes the ruined picture and leans down next to Lenny.
EVAN Come on, Lenny.
EVAN It's not that bad.
EVAN You can still see your mom a little.
Lenny, unable to stop crying, begins hyperventilating out of control.
His desperate gasps for breath are frightening.
Evan, scared, looks around for Mrs. Boswell, but cannot find her.
He reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his own macaroni "mother" apart and places it over Lenny's picture.
It's a nuclear family again.
Lenny slowly is able to catch his breath.
LENNY Can...
LENNY can...
LENNY Can I have this?
EVAN Sure.
EVAN I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Kayleigh helps Lenny glue a new "mother" in place and she smiles gratefully at Evan.
As Evan smiles back at Kayleigh, Mrs. Boswell calmly enters the room in time to see Evan tacking up his butchered family portrait.
She shivers.
Gothic.
Imposing.
Andrea runs up the stairs.
DR.
HARLON REDFIELD, 40, a handsome and extremely genial man, scrutinizes a disturbing drawing.
DR. REDFIELD And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
ANDREA Not according to his teacher.
ANDREA It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
DR. REDFIELD Hold it, hold it, Andrea.
DR. REDFIELD Let's not jump to conclusions.
DR. REDFIELD I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
Andrea nods and forces a thankful smile.
DR. REDFIELD Tell you what, bring Evan here tonight and we'll run a CAT-scan series.
The looming building looks even more frightening at night.
Andrea and Evan head up the stairs.
EVAN I don't like this place, Mom.
EVAN It's creepy.
EVAN Please can we go?
EVAN I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
ANDREA You'll be fine.
ANDREA Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests.
ANDREA You'll like him.
Andrea leads Evan into Dr. Redfield's office.
Dr. Redfield warmly greets Evan at the door.
DR. REDFIELD Hello, Evan.
DR. REDFIELD It's very nice to meet you.
DR. REDFIELD He's as handsome as his father.
EVAN You know my father?
Before Dr. Redfield can answer, Andrea cuts him off.
ANDREA That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan.
ANDREA Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
EVAN My father has a bad memory, too?
DR. REDFIELD Uh, tell you what, Evan.
DR. REDFIELD If it's okay with your mother, I'd like to run some tests.
DR. REDFIELD Nothing scary.
Evan raises an eyebrow at the doctor.
DR. REDFIELD Okay, it might be a little scary...
Evan looks terrified as he lies on a medical platform as a series of CAT-scan images are taken.
In another part of the room, a distressed Andrea speaks quietly with Dr. Redfield.
ANDREA Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
DR. REDFIELD Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders.
DR. REDFIELD But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
ANDREA Anything.
DR. REDFIELD A journal.
DR. REDFIELD Just have him write down everything he does.
ANDREA Why?
ANDREA What for?
DR. REDFIELD It could be extremely useful to jog his memory.
DR. REDFIELD See if he remembers anything new the next day.
DR. REDFIELD And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
The next morning.
Evan busily writes in his new black-marble mead comp book:
"Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayley and Tommy.
I will mete there father and see what a real dad is like.
Maybe one day I will mete my Dad."
Andrea, meanwhile, speaks into the phone as she pours Lucky Charms into a cereal bowl for Evan.
ANDREA Thanks, George.
ANDREA I really appreciate you watching him, he won't be any trouble at all.
Evan puts down the journal and eats breakfast.
He separates the green clovers from the cereal and drops them to the floor for Crockett to nibble.
EVAN These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
ANDREA Great.
ANDREA I'll see you soon.
Andrea hangs up the phone and walks into the next room.
Andrea grabs the pocket book off the coffee table and heads back into the kitchen.
She drops her purse in shock when she sees: Evan, in doorway, expressionless and holding a large BUTCHER KNIFE by his side.
ANDREA Evan?
Evan sees her but remains expressionless.
ANDREA Evan?
ANDREA What are you doing with that knife?
Life suddenly springs into Evan's face.
He seems stunned to find himself holding the knife and drops it.
EVAN What happened?
ANDREA Honey.
ANDREA What were you doing with that?
EVAN I...
EVAN I don't remember.
Andrea, still shaken, drops Evan off at the house of GEORGE MILLER, 35, a handsome athletic man with an infectious smile.
He approaches the car and opens the door for Evan.
MR. MILLER Hey, Andrea.
MR. MILLER Hello little man.
Andrea writes nervously on a piece of paper as Evan gets out.
ANDREA Thanks a lot George.
ANDREA Here's my work number in case there are any problems.
MR. MILLER Whaddaya kidding?
MR. MILLER We're going to have a great time today, right Evan?
Andrea nods thanks and nervously drives away.
Evan walks up to Mr. Miller and momentarily reaches for his hand.
Mr. Miller flinches his hand away and chuckles at Evan.
MR. MILLER You waiting for an invitation?
MR. MILLER The kids are inside.
Evan appears confused for a moment at Mr. Miller's unexpected rudeness, but walks inside.
Evan enters the well-kept middle class home and sees his classmates Kayleigh and Tommy.
Kayleigh is dressed in a make- shift Medieval gown and Tommy is also dressed in a period costume.
KAYLEIGH Evan, guess what?
KAYLEIGH Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
TOMMY I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
KAYLEIGH Quit it, Tommy.
KAYLEIGH Evan gets to be Robin Hood.
KAYLEIGH I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
TOMMY I thought I was the bad guy!
KAYLEIGH You are, silly.
KAYLEIGH He's a bad sheriff.
Mr. Miller, holding a full glass of scotch in one hand, sets the circa-80's bulky video camera on a tripod and plugs it into the porta-deck.
EVAN We're really gonna be in a movie!?
MR. MILLER That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
TOMMY I thought I was the star.
MR. MILLER Shut up, moron.
MR. MILLER Now get in your costume, Evan.
MR. MILLER And you have to promise, your bestest super-duper promise, that this will be our little secret.
MR. MILLER Think you can do that?
Evan nods and sticks his arms straight up in the air.
Mr.
Miller downs his drink and helps Evan off with his clothes.
Suddenly --
Evan comes to in an unfamiliar place.
The rec-room/basement.
Evan's eyes dart from the fireplace to Mr. Miller's camera lens and finally to Kayleigh, whose ashen face trembles slightly.
Panic spreads across Evan's face.
EVAN Where am I?
EVAN What happened?
EVAN Where did we all go?
MR. MILLER Calm down, kid.
MR. MILLER Stand still.
Evan backs up and awkwardly scurries around the basement, grabbing his clothes.
Panicking.
EVAN I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
MR. MILLER Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
EVAN Kayleigh?
EVAN What happened?
Kayleigh's eyes are unable to leave the floor.
She begins adjusting her disheveled clothing.
Evan trembles.
EVAN What's wrong with me?
Tommy silently watches from the top of the basement stairs, absently wringing the head off one of his sister's dolls.
Dr. Redfield places Evan's CAT-scan slides on the light box.
Andrea squints, unable to interpret them.
DR. REDFIELD Well, the good news is that the results are negative.
DR. REDFIELD I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
ANDREA And the bad news?
DR. REDFIELD Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with.
DR. REDFIELD It's harder playing detective now.
ANDREA But you must have something to go on?
DR. REDFIELD If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
ANDREA But he's seven.
ANDREA What kind of stress can he have?
DR. REDFIELD Plenty.
DR. REDFIELD Who knows?
DR. REDFIELD Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father.
DR. REDFIELD Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
ANDREA Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
DR. REDFIELD You'd be surprised how often they are.
ANDREA Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
DR. REDFIELD It's worth a shot.
DR. REDFIELD I can arrange a controlled meeting.
DR. REDFIELD A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring.
DR. REDFIELD Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
ANDREA How soon?...
Evan, dressed in his Sunday best, writes copiously in a journal marked "AGE 7."
"April 15.
Today I get to mete my father.
His name is Jason and he is crazy.
I hope he lets me call him dad."
Andrea tightly grips Evan's hand as the pair follow Dr.
Redfield down a corridor.
Evan's enthusiasm is dampened by the sounds of distant screams and bloodcurdling laughter.
EVAN Dad lives here?
DR. REDFIELD Not in this wing, actually.
DR. REDFIELD No.
ANDREA Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
EVAN Okay.
They walk to the end of the corridor and come to a "Visitor's Chamber".
Dr.Redfield leads Evan inside.
Andrea begins to follow, but the doctor gestures that she stay outside.
Evan takes a seat at a long rectangular table.
His eyes are fixated on the door on the other side of the room.
Finally, a dark figure can be seen through the opaque glass.
JASON, thirty and haggard looking, enters the room.
His eyes want to sparkle at seeing his son for the first time.
But tranquilizers have dulled the effect.
Evan's eyes fixate on the leg-restraints and handcuffs that hinder Jason's movement.
Finally Jason sits.
He smiles warmly and speaks in over-enunciated tones.
JASON It's okay.
JASON I won't bite.
JASON You've seen pictures of me, right?
EVAN Uh-huh.
EVAN Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Evan "comes to" in another unfamiliar place.
Rather than seeing his father across a table, he's looking up at a ceiling.
Blocking his view of the ceiling is Jason, whose face is now monstrous with rage, and whose cuffed hands are wrapped around Evan's throat, choking the life out of him.
JASON I...
JASON love...
JASON you.
Suddenly, ORDERLIES tackle Jason from both sides and wedge a baton under his jaw to wrench him away.
Andrea frantically struggles to rescue Evan from Jason's clutches.
JASON He has to die!
JASON You don't understand!
JASON It's the only way to stop it!
Jason wrestles the baton from under his chin, hits an orderly in the kneecap and comes for Evan with the baton!
Orderly #2 acts quickly, beating Jason with his baton.
As Jason makes another desperate grab for Evan, Orderly #2 is forced to bash him in the skull.
Down for the count.
Andrea hugs Evan, now in shock.
ANDREA I'm sorry, Evan.
ANDREA I'm sorry.
And ALARM sounds and Andrea tries to cover Evan's eyes, but through her fingers he can see a quick blur of a pool of blood spreading from Jason's head.
Dressed in black, Andrea and Evan watch Jason's casket being lowered into the ground.
Andrea's tears soak through her veil.
A few feet back, Kayleigh stands behind Evan.
PRIEST Ashes to ashes...
PRIEST dust to dust.
Evan watches the coffin descend, disappearing from sight.
Kayleigh steps up to Evan and takes his hand.
A moment.
And she softly whispers in Evan's ear.
KAYLEIGH You're better off anyway.
A rumble of thunder.
Evan looks up at the brooding dark clouds.
Gray skies.
Andrea drives the children home.
Evan stares at the passing tombstones that flutter by like a white picket fence.
The flickering strobe effect that intensifies into a white blur is hypnotic.
Bright and sunny.
The lawn freshly cut.
A Toro lawnmower has been carelessly left in the grass-strewn driveway.
CRANE DOWN to the window of the --
Evan, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny are now THIRTEEN.
Evan exhales cigarette smoke, taps his ash and finishes sketching a portrait of Kayleigh in his journal.
Tommy wears a leather jacket and now has traces of peach fuzz on his upper lip.
Kayleigh's hair is longer now, albeit stringy and unkempt.
Evan closes his journal and coolly ignites a STRIKE-ANYWHERE MATCH with his thumb and lights Kayleigh's cigarette.
Everyone but Lenny smokes in the basement.
Tommy, now with longer hair, ransacks his father's army locker looking for something.
EVAN Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here.
EVAN What's up already?
TOMMY Hold your horses, man.
TOMMY It's here somewhere.
TOMMY I saw it when I was a kid.
Tommy absently chucks an old Playboy toward Lenny.
Kayleigh seems uncomfortable by the sight of it.
KAYLEIGH We should go soon.
KAYLEIGH If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
EVAN So let's go.
EVAN This place creeps me out.
Evan claps his hands and stands up, Lenny and Kayleigh join him.
Finally, Tommy shakes an old army thermos and hears something rattling inside.
TOMMY I knew it had something to do with the army.
Tommy opens the thermos, tips it over and a blockbuster (1/4 stick of dynamite) spills out.
Tommy grins mischievously.
TOMMY Let's blow the shit out of something!
Tommy leads Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny on a mission through the woods.
Everyone smokes except Lenny, yet he's the only one who's wheezing.
He pulls out an inhaler and takes a puff.
LENNY Guys, slow up, would you?
KAYLEIGH Evan, did I tell you?
KAYLEIGH My mother said I might be able to visit her this summer in Orlando with her new family.
TOMMY What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
KAYLEIGH Where the hell are you taking us anyway?
KAYLEIGH Just blow something up already.
TOMMY Just blow something up?
TOMMY Are you nuts?
TOMMY There's an art to mass destruction.
TOMMY Would you just paint the Mona Lisa?
TOMMY No.
TOMMY Besides, we're here already.
Now at the edge of the woods, Tommy spots:
A MAILBOX sits at the end of the driveway.
It's exquisite.
An exact replica of a Colonial home it serves.
Across the street, Tommy hands the blockbuster to Lenny.
TOMMY Here you go, buddy.
LENNY What?
LENNY No frigging way, man.
LENNY I'm not touching that thing.
TOMMY The hell you aren't.
TOMMY Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
LENNY Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.
LENNY Look how small that fuse is!
LENNY I'll get killed.
EVAN Not necessarily.
All eyes turn to Evan as he takes his lit cigarette, breaks off the filter and jams the fuse into the unlit end.
EVAN That should buy you ten minutes at least.
LENNY Gee, thanks friend.
Lenny paces back and forth next to the three-story mailbox, desperately trying to appear nonchalant.
He pretends to notice his shoe's untied and bends down to tie it.
From the woods, the other kids watch anxiously.
TOMMY Oh, for Christ's sake, just do it, Lenny.
Finally, Lenny throws the bomb in the mailbox.
Then sprints like hell to the woods.
Kayleigh shakes Lenny's inhaler and hands it to him when he gets back.
LENNY Thanks.
Evan pats Lenny on the back.
EVAN You got balls, man.
The four watch the mailbox in intense anticipation.
Evan smiles with the cigarette pressed tightly between his lips and places his hands over Kayleigh's ears.
She smiles back at him and presses his hands against her head.
Tommy catches this and seems disturbed, and quickly turns back to --
The mailbox.
Tick-tock...
tick-tock...
It's like a staring contest...
Evan, running full speed, comes to in an unfamiliar place.
He instantly loses his footing and falls to the ground.
Lenny, falling on top of him.
TOMMY Hurry!
TOMMY Let's go!
TOMMY Get him up, Evan!
TOMMY Come on!
EVAN What happened??
EVAN Where are we?!
Evan gets up and starts running, then realizes he's not being followed.
Kayleigh and Tommy are helping Lenny up and carrying him.
Evan realizes that Lenny's completely dazed.
Evan doubles back, grabs Lenny's arm and he and Tommy drag Lenny through the woods as fast as they can.
KAYLEIGH Oh God...
KAYLEIGH what did we do?
EVAN Shit, Lenny.
EVAN What's happened to you!
EVAN We've gotta get help!
Andrea's car screeches to the curb of Lenny's house.
Lenny's mother, Mrs. Kagan, frantically loads Lenny into an ambulance.
As Andrea rushes up to the ambulance, Mrs. Kagan gives her an icy glare and slams the ambulance door in Andrea's face.
Andrea turns to Evan, now trembling on the front stoop.
ANDREA What is it?
ANDREA What happened?
TOMMY We were just building a fort in the woods when Lenny freaked out.
TOMMY One minute he was fine, then he just froze up.
TOMMY Right guys?
ANDREA What happened, Evan?
ANDREA The truth.
EVAN I don't know...
EVAN I don't remember.
ANDREA Something must've happened!
ANDREA What set him off?
EVAN I...
EVAN I blacked out.
ANDREA Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Evan looks helpless.
ANDREA You're not making this up, are you?
Evan shakes his head "no".
Almost ashamed...
Evan lies on a couch.
DR. REDFIELD With every breath you exhale, you can feel all of the tension draining from your body like water through a faucet.
DR. REDFIELD Nine, ten, and you're completely asleep.
DR. REDFIELD Relaxed.
Evan breathes slowly.
Deeply.
Andrea watches nervously from the far side of the room.
DR. REDFIELD Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny.
DR. REDFIELD Think of it like a movie.
DR. REDFIELD You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish.
DR. REDFIELD Understand?
EVAN Yes.
DR. REDFIELD Where are you now?
EVAN I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
DR. REDFIELD Are you hurting her?
EVAN No, protecting her.
Andrea suppresses the tiniest of proud smiles.
DR. REDFIELD Okay.
DR. REDFIELD Then go a little forward in time.
DR. REDFIELD What do you see now?
EVAN I see a car.
Evan's eyes suddenly roll back in his head.
DR. REDFIELD Yes, tell me about the car.
Evan moans and begins shaking.
DR. REDFIELD Go on.
DR. REDFIELD Nothing can hurt you.
DR. REDFIELD Remember, this is only a movie.
DR. REDFIELD You're completely safe.
EVAN I can't...
EVAN the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
DR. REDFIELD The car doesn't vanish Evan.
DR. REDFIELD The movie in your head has broken, that's all.
DR. REDFIELD But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
EVAN It's coming...
EVAN argh!
EVAN I can't!
Evan moans and shakes on the couch.
DR. REDFIELD Fight it Evan.
DR. REDFIELD Hurry.
DR. REDFIELD It's coming!
Blood begins to trickle from Evan's nose as a guttural sound is uttered from deep within him.
Dr. Redfield bolts upright in his chair and redirects the session.
DR. REDFIELD Okay, Evan.
DR. REDFIELD Listen to my voice!
DR. REDFIELD On the count of ten, you're going to wake up.
DR. REDFIELD Feeling refreshed and remembering everything we talked about.
Evan moans in agony.
Andrea darts into the room.
ANDREA What's happening to him??
ANDREA Make it stop!
Dr. Redfield waves her away and concentrates on Evan.
DR. REDFIELD One.
DR. REDFIELD You're feeling more awake now.
DR. REDFIELD Two, your eyes no longer feel heavy.
Andrea moves to stop the blood flowing from Evan's nose.
She lifts Evan's eyelids and sees only the whites of his eyes.
DR. REDFIELD Five.
DR. REDFIELD Six.
DR. REDFIELD Refreshed and awake!
DR. REDFIELD Seven, eight.
DR. REDFIELD Come on, Evan, wake up, dammit!
Evan is completely non-responsive.
ANDREA Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
DR. REDFIELD Nine, ten.
DR. REDFIELD And you're awake!
DR. REDFIELD Open your eyes, dammit!
Nothing but moans and blood.
Dr. Redfield frantically opens some desk drawers until he finds smelling salts.
He breaks a small capsule under evan's mouth, pinches his bleeding nose closed and lets Evan inhale the vapor through his mouth.
Evan lurches forward on the couch and falls off.
Holding his bloody nose.
EVAN What happened?
EVAN Did it work?
Evan deduces the answer from everyone's horrified faces.
Andrea drops off Evan, Kayleigh and Tommy outside the complex.
Kayleigh, looking morose, shuts the car door and Andrea drives off.
They walk through the parking lot.
TOMMY Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted.
TOMMY You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
KAYLEIGH I'm sorry.
EVAN Would someone just tell me already what the hell happened in the mailbox?
On "mailbox", Tommy suddenly grabs Evan's jacket and SHOVES him against a parked car.
Tommy looks around to make sure nobody heard anything.
TOMMY Don't ever bring that shit up again.
TOMMY Not ever.
TOMMY Not to me, not to Kayleigh, or even Lenny.
TOMMY The stupid fuck if he ever learns to talk again.
TOMMY Understand?
Evan nods, scared.
Tommy gives a final shove.
TOMMY Ever.
TOMMY She don't want to talk about it, anyway.
TOMMY Do you Kayleigh?
Tommy's right.
Kayleigh clearly doesn't.
Kayleigh shuffles behind Evan and Tommy as they head toward the theatre.
Evan drops back.
EVAN Are you okay?
Kayleigh says nothing as Tommy sees the theatre playing SEVEN and whispers.
TOMMY There it is.
TOMMY Let's go.
Andrea does the dishes as the TV plays a NEWSCAST in the b.g.
ANCHOR ...was the grizzly aftermath of what police officials of upstate New York are calling a horrible act of vandalism gone awry.
Andrea turns to the TV, blocking our view.
We can only hear the report as she watches intensely.
ANCHOR The powerful explosion is believed to have been caused by a small quantity of dynamite.
Andrea's face looks haunted by the on-screen images.
She shakes her head in terror and grabs the remote.
ANCHOR Police thus far have no leads as to the suspects...
She clicks off the TV, trembling.
The movie's in progress.
Evan and Kayleigh sit behind Tommy.
TOMMY Holy shit!
TOMMY Look at that fat fuck!
TOMMY You'd have to wipe his ass with a forklift!
Some crowd members TURN around and give Tommy a SHUSH.
Tommy whips M&Ms at them.
TOMMY Shut up, faggot.
TOMMY No one's talking to you!
Kayleigh, repulsed, suddenly darts from the aisle and runs out.
Evan follows.
Evan follows her to a small alcove.
EVAN I'm sorry Kayleigh.
EVAN This was a bad idea.
KAYLEIGH You really don't remember anything that happened?
Evan shakes his head "no".
She looks devastated.
KAYLEIGH You're so lucky.
She begins to cry.
Evan makes sure no one's staring.
EVAN It's going to be okay.
EVAN Lenny'll be fine.
EVAN You'll see.
He reaches to comfort her.
But she winces.
KAYLEIGH Ouch.
EVAN I'm sorry.
She pulls her sleeve up, revealing a large bruise.
KAYLEIGH It's not your fault.
KAYLEIGH Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
EVAN Damn.
EVAN Your dad did this?
Kayleigh pulls back her shirt collar to show an even larger, darker bruise.
KAYLEIGH I deserve a lot worse.
EVAN What are you talking about?
EVAN What you deserve is a better brother and father.
EVAN All they do is make you feel like shit.
She looks into his eyes.
EVAN You really have no clue how beautiful you are, do you?
She searches his eyes for sincerity.
And finds it.
They lean into each other for a TENDER KISS.
After a moment, a ROAR from nearby.
TOMMY What the fuck are you doing??
They jerk back to see Tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring at them from across a small crowd.
By now, some teens chuckle at Tommy.
TEEN PUNK Buying popcorn, what the fuck are you doing?
Tommy rushes through the small crowd at Evan.
His hands in fists.
Suddenly a FOOT reaches out and trips Tommy.
Tommy falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him.
Tommy slowly gets up, locks eyes with Evan.
Hatred oozing.
Evan looks guilty, weakly shaking his head, it's not what you're thinking.
Tommy suddenly lunges at the TEEN PUNK who must be at least a foot taller than he is.
Tommy lands a flurry of punches before the Teen Punk can even defend himself, frequently taking opportunities to eyeball Evan.
Evan, Kayleigh and even the punk's FRIENDS look on helplessly when TWO SECURITY GUARDS SEIZE TOMMY.
Tommy valiantly struggles against them at first.
But the moment he realizes it's hopeless, he allows his body to go slack.
As Tommy is being dragged away, he turns to Evan, a sick smile on his face.
Evan and Kayleigh look back, speechless.
Andrea drives through the winding roads.
Andrea's eyes.
Tormented.
REVEAL she's driving Evan and Kayleigh home.
Evan's up front and Kayleigh sits behind them.
Everyone silent.
Andrea stares through the rearview mirror into Kayleigh's eyes.
Probing.
Searching.
ANDREA So how was the movie?
KAYLEIGH Okay.
Andrea watches Kayleigh.
A calculated beat.
ANDREA Any exploding mailboxes?
Kayleigh flinches at the question.
And Andrea catches it.
Evan can't help but look back at Kayleigh.
Oh my god, she knows.
KAYLEIGH What do you mean?
Andrea pulls the car over and stops.
After a moment, Kayleigh realizes she's at her house.
She exits the car in a hurry.
ANDREA Goodnight.
Andrea stares at Evan, who keeps his eyes facing dead ahead.
She finally shifts the car into gear.
ANDREA We're moving.
Evan says nothing.
A "For Sale" sign is now planted on the front lawn.
Andrea, in her nurse uniform, exits the house to her car.
Evan discreetly watches her leave through the window.
Grabs his coat and exits frame.
Kayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house.
EVAN I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me.
EVAN He knows I'm moving away, right?
KAYLEIGH He's been acting real strange lately.
KAYLEIGH He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
EVAN Duck, here they come.
As a station wagon rolls up the street, Evan and Kayleigh duck in nearby bushes.
KAYLEIGH Did your mom say if Lenny was...
KAYLEIGH okay?
EVAN He must be.
EVAN They're letting him go, right?
The station wagon finally heads into the driveway.
Evan puts on a smile and charges the car, pounding the window.
EVAN Welcome home, Lenny!
Inside the car, Lenny jerks back in horror.
Mrs. Kagan looks angry as she rolls the window down.
MRS. KAGAN I think your little homecoming's in bad taste.
The smile fades from Evan's face.
Kayleigh hangs back.
EVAN Sorry?
MRS. KAGAN Lenny's been through a hell of an ordeal no thanks to you.
Evan and Kayleigh look guilty as the garage door opens up and Mrs. Kagan continues into the garage.
Alone, Lenny concentrates on a MODEL AIRPLANE.
There is a sudden KNOCK at the window.
Lenny's head jerks around to see Evan and Kayleigh smiling through the window.
Evan and Kayleigh stand on the ivy-covered trellis.
EVAN Welcome home.
EVAN Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
KAYLEIGH Hi, Lenny.
Lenny twitches ever-so-slightly.
LENNY Is Tommy with you guys?
Evan shakes his head "no".
EVAN It's cool.
Lenny looks back at the model airplane.
Needs to think.
Evan, Lenny and Kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods.
KAYLEIGH So what did you do in there?
LENNY It was awful.
LENNY You can't sleep 'cause everyone's screaming all night long.
LENNY I never want to go back.
As Evan and Kayleigh absorb this in silence, they see a column of smoke billowing in the horizon.
KAYLEIGH Do you see that?
Evan and Kayleigh run toward the smoke.
Lenny nervously follows behind.
They exit the woods to find:
Tommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses with lighter fluid.
Next to a campfire.
EVAN Crockett!!
Evan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog.
Tommy is ready for them.
He drops the lighter fluid, picks up a wooden plank and SWINGS!
Evan ducks back at the last minute and Tommy accidentally connects with Kayleigh's head.
Knocking her unconscious.
TOMMY Look what you made me do!
EVAN What's wrong with you?!
Tommy, enraged, fakes a high swing, then goes for Evan's knee cap.
BASH!
Evan doubles over in pain and falls to the ground, clutching his knee.
Tommy moves to the fire, Crockett squirming inside the bag and picks up the lighter fluid.
Evan painfully looks up from the ground and his eyes dart from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped in the tied gunny sack.
EVAN Kayleigh!
EVAN Wake up!
No response.
TOMMY Why don't you fucking kiss her, Prince Charming!
Tommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a flaming fuse from the campfire to the fluid soaked dog.
As the flames near Crockett, Evan, seething with rage, stands up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy at FULL SPEED --
Evan comes to in an unfamiliar place.
Still in running mode.
His body contorts spastically like a fish on land, since he is now lying face down on the ground.
Evan regains himself and sits up painfully.
His face is badly bruised and he clutches his battered ribs.
EVAN How long was I out?
He gets no answer from Lenny, who stands in the exact same spot.
Tommy is nowhere in sight and the sound is of Kayleigh weeping.
Evan spins to face her.
EVAN Kayleigh?!
EVAN Are you okay?
EVAN Where's Crockett?
Kayleigh, her knees drawn tightly to her chest, is unable to answer through her tears.
Evan struggles to rise but he becomes dizzy and falls back to the ground.
Evan takes a quick glance toward the gunny sack, smouldering then moans and buries his head in his hands.
A small neighborhood CROWD has gathered to watch an ambulance with the SUNNYVALE insignia take an entranced Lenny away.
Mrs. Kagan is about to climb in the rear when she stops and turns to Evan.
MRS. KAGAN Do you know what you are?
MRS. KAGAN A monster.
Evan stands there, speechless.
A packed U-HAUL sits in front of Evan's house.
Andrea shifts the small truck into gear and slowly pulls out.
Outside the truck, Kayleigh waves to Evan, tears spilling shamelessly down her cheeks.
Evan reaches behind his seat and opens a large cardboard box.
It is filled with past journals.
He finds the most recent journal, uncaps a pen and writes something.
Finished he presses the journal to the window.
"I'll come back for you."
Evan waves back to her, trying nonchalantly to wipe away his own tears as she fades into the distance.
When Kayleigh disappears from sight, Andrea looks over to see what he's written.
ANDREA I'm sorry.
Evan returns the journal and begins writing furiously.
Evan, twenty now, continues writing in a college Blue Book.
He is older, dressed down in worn jeans, T-shirt and plaid flannel.
He closes the Blue Book with a cocky grin just as PROFESSOR CARTER, 40, calls out to the class:
PROFESSOR CARTER Time!
PROFESSOR CARTER Please place your blue books on my desk before you leave.
Evan grabs his psychology textbook from under his seat, gets up and turns in his exam.
PROFESSOR CARTER How'd you do, Evan?
Evan flashes a confident smile.
EVAN I'm not sure.
EVAN I might have gotten some stories mixed up.
EVAN Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
PROFESSOR CARTER Typical psych major.
PROFESSOR CARTER A complete wise ass.
PROFESSOR CARTER And how's your project coming?
PROFESSOR CARTER Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
EVAN Hey, I got no choice.
Professor Carter nods solemnly, obviously in the know.
Evan bikes past students.
Evan bikes past some obnoxious GREEKS.
Evan docks his bike and carries his knapsack inside.
Evan's dorm is cluttered "double" whose walls are adorned with head-shop posters of Gothic rock bands.
By Evan's bed is a bookshelf filled with books on amnesia, memory loss, fugues, hypnotism and other related bands.
Evan's roommate, THUMPER, 19, is a completely punked out Gothic boy who weighs 300 pounds.
He currently hands a black lacy dress to CRICKET, 17, a pierced Goth co-ed.
She slips the tattered dress on as Thumper wipes his post-coital self off with a black tee-shirt.
Evan barges through the door, throwing his pscyh books on the bed and politely looking away from the half-naked girl.
EVAN Whoa.
EVAN Smells like patchouli and...
EVAN ass.
Evan opens the window and checks out his Psych project: a small maze has several flatworms at one end and a bowl of cornflakes at the other.
THUMPER Cricket, meet my well-mannered roommate, Evan.
Cricket puts on her Doc Martens as Evan watches the worms.
CRICKET Yeah, you're the one who fucked up the bell-curve on my Anthropology final.
CRICKET Later, Thumper.
EVAN Nice to meet you, too.
As she leaves, Thumper takes the black T-shirt by his wallet and throws it on Evan's bed.
THUMPER Here, bro.
THUMPER Found your T-shirt.
Evan nods thanks, picks up his journal.
Reads something and smiles.
EVAN Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
THUMPER I thought you were a December baby.
EVAN This is bigger.
EVAN Seven years to the day.
EVAN No blackouts.
Thumper pulls out a bong.
THUMPER Let's do this.
A popular watering hole.
A dark rustic interior, blasting alternative rock.
Plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their tables.
Evan and Thumper play pool against two young women.
HEIDI, beautiful, wears ripped jeans, no make up.
She sinks the eleven ball off the rail.
KRISTEN coolly smokes a cigarette, confident that she and Heidi will hold the table.
KRISTEN So...
KRISTEN which one of you has a pet worm?
Thumper proudly steps forward.
THUMPER Worms, plural.
KRISTEN That's so gross.
Thumper steps back, points to Evan.
THUMPER Talk to him about it, he's got the fetish.
Heidi sinks another ball and looks up at Evan strangely.
EVAN Actually, they're for a psych project.
EVAN A study on memory.
Heidi misses her shot and passes the cue to Evan.
HEIDI Shit, better explain before all the excitement gives me a heart attack.
Evan speaks as he knocks the one-ball in the corner pocket.
As he talks, at a table behind them, some obnoxious Greeks, including HUNTER, SPENCER, and GWEN make fun of Thumper.
EVAN It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze.
EVAN You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it.
EVAN Then you put a new flatworm in the maze.
EVAN He's clueless.
EVAN Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
THUMPER Like Ozzy.
Gwen giggles as Spencer throws popcorn at Thumper's head.
SPENCER Ten bucks says he eats it off the floor.
Thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks the three-ball in the side.
EVAN You chop up the smart flatworm and feed it to the dumb one and presto, the dumb one suddenly knows the maze inside and out.
Evan walks past Heidi, putting his hand on her shoulder to squeeze by.
The hand lingers longer than necessary and Heidi doesn't mind.
He sinks another ball.
EVAN Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
THUMPER That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
A handful of popcorn hits Thumper's face.
They all try to ignore Hunter and Spencer's jeers.
HEIDI So what's the point?
EVAN Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Another barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket.
Although his hand clenches on the cue.
He meekly shuffles away to the opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks.
HEIDI So are you planning on becoming a doctor or something?
Thumper casually takes the pool cue from Evan.
EVAN No, I just don't want to lose my mind.
As Heidi digests this, Thumper carefully lines up his shot...
The eight ball.
CRASH!!!
The cue ball intentionally jumps the table, rocketing into the pitcher of beer on the Greek's table.
They're all soaked with beer and debris.
Just as they begin to rise, Thumper smashes the cue stick on the table, WHISTLING innocently (while now brandishing a spear).
They sit the fuck down.
Kristin, impressed, casually wraps her arm around Thumper's waist.
He smiles coolly, it's nothing.
EVAN I think that's your game.
Evan and Heidi, making out, burst through the door and fall on the bed.
Evan's shirt is unbuttoned and Heidi strokes his chest.
Suddenly Heidi stops and sniffs the air.
HEIDI Smells like sex in here.
EVAN Thumper had a busy afternoon.
HEIDI You're kidding.
HEIDI He's so...
HEIDI big.
Evan drunkenly crosses the room, grabs two beers from the mini-fridge.
EVAN Charisma and eyeliner go a long way, I guess.
EVAN Wanna beer?
Heidi takes one.
Looks under the bed.
HEIDI Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are...
HEIDI comp books.
EVAN Yeah.
EVAN I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
HEIDI Wow...
HEIDI read something.
Evan chugs his beer and sits next to her on the bed and puts his arm around her.
Very drunk.
EVAN No way, I'd be too embarrassed.
Heidi teasingly runs her fingers over his smooth torso.
HEIDI Then keep drinking, worm-boy.
HEIDI You're too uptight.
Evan stops short.
EVAN Freeze!
EVAN No "worm-boy".
EVAN No "Mr.
EVAN Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it.
EVAN And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
HEIDI Deal.
HEIDI Now read me something.
Heidi hands him a book marked "AGE 13".
He flips it open to a random place and takes the beer from her hand.
EVAN For courage.
Evan takes and finishes her beer and begins reading.
As he reads, he seems more and more on the verge of passing out.
EVAN It's like my mind refused to believe what it was seeing.
EVAN Hearing Crockett make those awful screams...
EVAN Just writing about it gives me the shivers.
Color drains from Evan's face as he realizes what he's reading.
He looks over at Heidi, who kisses him.
HEIDI Come on, go on...
EVAN It was like Tommy was possessed or something.
EVAN There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
As Evan reads, the world seems to ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY VIBRATE around him LIKE A TUNING FORK.
His voice becomes distant and SOUNDS ECHO around him like distant memories resurrecting themselves...
Evan is THIRTEEN again.
The scene begins exactly where Evan's blackout occurred as a child.
Tommy has just knocked Kayleigh unconscious with a wooden plank, Lenny is frozen at the sight of Crockett in the fluid-soaked gunny sack.
And Evan, seething with rage, stands up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy at full speed.
Evan looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings.
EVAN What the hell is going on?
Before an answer comes, Tommy smiles at his good fortune and swings the plank, hitting Evan's head.
Evan is sent sprawling backwards, his forehead bleeding freely.
Tommy knocks Evan hard in the ribs with his boots.
Evan writhes in agony, his face against the ground.
Lenny moves toward the gunny sack, lifts it and tugs desperately on the rope that traps Crockett inside.
LENNY I can't undo the rope!
Tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile.
TOMMY Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
As if on cue, Lenny does exactly as he's told.
His eyes begin to glaze over.
Evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of strength, grabs Tommy's foot and holds on.
EVAN I got him, Lenny.
EVAN Help Crockett!
Lenny remains frozen in place.
Tommy yanks his leg back, breaking Evan's grip.
Evan groans on the ground in a writhing heap.
Tommy's voice hitches.
His eyes water from pent up frustration.
TOMMY Listen to me good, Evan.
TOMMY There's a million other sisters in the world.
TOMMY You didn't have to fuck with mine.
Tommy smiles viciously at Lenny, traumatized to watch Tommy pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the campfire to the soaked gunny sack.
And Evan passes out.
Evan comes to with Heidi slapping him awake.
EVAN Oh my God!
EVAN No!
EVAN No!
Heidi rolls her eyes.
HEIDI Wake up, idiot.
HEIDI It was just a dream.
She stands and angrily puts on her jacket.
EVAN It didn't feel like a dream.
HEIDI Maybe because they never do.
HEIDI So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Evan doesn't even hear her.
After getting his bearings, he grabs his jacket and exits, leaving her dumbfounded.
Evan drives...
Evan, exhausted, finally pulls into Lenny's driveway.
Very little has changed in the past seven years.
Now 20, making a model airplane.
He's still overweight and looks like his mother dresses him.
The room is filled with model airplanes.
Hundreds of them.
A KNOCK on Lenny's bedroom door.
Mrs. Kagan, grayer, fatter, opens the door and escorts Evan inside.
She glares at Evan while pretending to be cheerful.
MRS. KAGAN I've got a surprise for you, Lenny.
MRS. KAGAN You'll never guess who's here.
Lenny looks up to see Evan, his jaw drops.
Looking around, shocked to see:
Nothing has changed in the past seven years.
The same kids' toys, posters and comic books.
We see he's working on the model again, in his own world.
The window of opportunity for conversation has closed.
EVAN Hey, uh, it's me.
EVAN Evan.
Silence.
Lenny frowns.
EVAN What's that you're working on?
EVAN A model?
Nothing.
EVAN Well, you look busy, so maybe I should make this quick.
EVAN I'd totally understand if you didn't want to get into this right now, but that day at the junkyard, could you help me remember what happened?
EVAN Any details?
No response.
Evan picks up a model airplane from the desk.
LENNY I couldn't cut the rope.
EVAN Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
LENNY Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Evan, startled, drops the model on the desk.
An epiphany.
EVAN Jesus Christ.
EVAN It really happened.
Lenny stares out the window.
EVAN What if I can get back all my lost memories with my journals.
With lightning speed, Lenny jumps from his desk and unexpectedly shoves EVAN IN TO THE WALL.
Squadrons of hanging planes crash to the floor.
Lenny digs his fingers into Evan's shoulder.
LENNY Make one peep and I swear it'll be your last, motherfucker.
Evan is terrified.
Then Lenny suddenly moves back and begins working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away.
Evan is speechless.
The door bursts open.
Mrs. Kagan looks at the smashed model airplanes by Evan's feet.
Evan ignores her accusing stare.
EVAN Well, thanks for seeing me, man.
EVAN I shouldn't have waited so long.
When Lenny doesn't respond, Mrs. Kagan hustles Evan back into the hallway.
Evan pulls a dozen journals from beneath his bed and begins pouring over them.
Nearby, Thumper empties a can of hairspray into his Mohawk.
THUMPER You really think he wanted to kill you?
EVAN All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
He finds something he's looking for, marks the page with a yellow post-it note marked, BLACKOUT and sets the book in a separate pile.
As he sets the next journal on the bed, it automatically opens up to a place where the spine was bent.
Staring up at him is the message:
"I will come back for you."
Evan looks overcome by guilt.
Later that evening:
Evan has now organized a pile of five journals.
He selects an entry, begins reading and suddenly closes the journal.
Fear covers his face.
He holds one of his hands up and isn't surprised to see it trembling.
He opens his journal again and reads out loud.
EVAN The last thing I remember before the blackout was holding my hands over Kayleigh's ears...
EVAN I think I was more focused on her hands on mine than the mailbox across the street...
His own words grow reverberant, distant.
Furthermore, the walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before.
Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy, all thirteen, watch the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation.
When Evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt,
The mailbox...
tick-tock, tick-tock...
Like a staring contest.
LENNY Maybe it went out.
LENNY Should someone check it?
TOMMY Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls into the driveway.
MRS.
HALPERN, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of the car and walks to the mailbox.
Across the street, Tommy digs his fingers into the nerves of Lenny's shoulder.
TOMMY Make one peep and I swear it'll be your last, motherfucker.
Tommy's words make Evan flinch.
From inside the car, a BABY begins to cry.
Mrs. Halpern walks back to the car.
Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the lit cigarette to the ground.
He pulls up his shirt revealing a fresh BURN MARK on his stomach.
MRS. HALPERN How's my sweet girl?
MRS. HALPERN Awww, you need a change, don't you honey?
Mrs. Halpern picks her up and carries her to the house.
As the mother unlocks the front door to the house, the kids break into wide smiles of relief.
But wait...
The mother remembers the mail and carries the baby back to the mailbox.
Now Tommy is the only one left still smiling.
MRS. HALPERN You want to open the door, honey?
The baby fumbles with the mailbox's door handle for a moment --
The blast is deafening.
Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny watch the results in stunned horror.
TOMMY C'mon!
TOMMY Run!!
Evan and Kayleigh slowly back away in shock and begin to run a few steps when they realize that Lenny isn't with them.
TOMMY Lenny?
TOMMY Come on!
KAYLEIGH Oh my God oh my God...
Lenny doesn't seem to hear, his eyes fixated on the crimson road.
Evan and Tommy double back and grab him.
They try to make him break out into a run, but Lenny's feet drag limply against the ground.
Both Tommy and Evan grab an arm and begin to run with Lenny through the woods.
Evan comes to.
Lurches his body over the bed and vomits.
Sounds of squeaky bed springs fill the room.
Looking sick and pale, he lifts his shirt to see a NEW SCAR from the cigarette burn.
EVAN What the hell?
In the next bed, Thumper's head, wrapped in a blanket, pops up from above a NAKED GESELA'S waist.
THUMPER Christ, man.
THUMPER You wanna clean that up before I lose my appetite here?
Evan sits upright in bed and begins writing in the margins of the journal.
The lobby is decorated with colorful streamers, balloons, posters and banners announcing PARENTS' WEEKEND.
Carefree STUDENTS and their parents carry shopping bags toward the bustling elevators.
Evan leans against the side of a pay phone, holding his ear to drawn out the noise.
EVAN Yes, hello, uh, Mrs. Kagan, this is Evan Treborn.
EVAN I know.
EVAN I'm sorry about that.
EVAN But I really need to speak with him.
She's obviously hung up on him.
Suddenly, a HAND grabs his shoulder.
It's PROFESSOR CARTER.
PROFESSOR CARTER Whoa!
PROFESSOR CARTER Didn't mean to scare you, Evan.
PROFESSOR CARTER Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
EVAN Oh, fine I guess.
EVAN It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
PROFESSOR CARTER I know, I know.
PROFESSOR CARTER Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
Evan shrugs and forces a smile.
PROFESSOR CARTER Just don't drop the ball, okay?
EVAN I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Carter waves to another student and her parents and walks away.
A waiter clears the dishes away from Evan and Andrea's table.
Her hair now has gray streaks.
As she signs for the bill, she leans over and kisses Evan on the cheek.
EVAN Please, mom.
EVAN People will talk.
ANDREA I can't help it.
ANDREA I'm just so proud of you.
ANDREA You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
EVAN Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
ANDREA Please.
ANDREA He got straight A's without ever touching a book.
ANDREA That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
EVAN Ma?
EVAN Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
Andrea's smile fades.
ANDREA Why do you ask?
EVAN No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
ANDREA When he was around your age...
ANDREA almost exactly your age.
ANDREA He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
Evan tries not to react.
ANDREA I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms.
ANDREA You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
EVAN Sure...
ANDREA And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
EVAN What?
EVAN What could he do?
Andrea shakes her head.
ANDREA Forget it.
ANDREA It's nothing.
ANDREA He was far too sick by then.
Evan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface.
Evan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room looking for a certain book.
Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly watches Evan with growing concern.
EVAN I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
THUMPER What the fuck are you doing?
EVAN Shhh!
EVAN I need quiet for this.
Thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away.
THUMPER Are you stupid or what?
EVAN What?
THUMPER Shucks, I dunno.
THUMPER But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
Thumper begins scanning the journal entry.
A bitter laugh.
THUMPER Yeah, man.
THUMPER I'd think twice about this.
THUMPER You could wake up a lot more fucked up than you are now.
He hands the journal back to Evan.
Evan opens it and begins reading it silently.
His hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in defeat.
Evan, looking haggard and frail, wipes the greasy hair from his eyes and punches the accelerator.
His teeth are clenched and he hammers his fist on the dashboard.
Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner.
He eyes a piece of paper with an address scrawled on it and gets out.
A run-down greasy spoon.
Filled with a number of TOWNIES and TRUCKERS.
The place is stale with cigarette smoke and appears decorated in grime motif.
Evan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of the kitchen with a tray full of food.
Kayleigh, now twenty, looks pale and sickly thin.
She bangs her hip on the swinging door and an order of food crashes to the floor.
Her BOSS stares back in aggravation.
BOSS Can we get through one goddamned day without you breaking something?
Kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up the order.
She is humiliated and Evan leans back against a pay phone so that she can't see him watching her.
As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a CUSTOMER pinches her ass.
Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense.
She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the customer.
Evan backs out uncomfortably.
Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she exits.
Evan steps out of the shadows.
She's startled at first, but eventually recognizes him.
A smile flickers across her face and she allows herself to be hugged.
KAYLEIGH God, Evan!
KAYLEIGH I never thought I'd see you again.
KAYLEIGH How've you been?
EVAN Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
KAYLEIGH No, Evan.
KAYLEIGH I don't know.
KAYLEIGH It's been a long time.
KAYLEIGH Fill me in.
EVAN I'm going to State now.
EVAN Things are going okay.
EVAN I guess.
EVAN Mom's good...
Kayleigh nods and they walk down the street.
She reaches into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes.
EVAN Not since we were kids.
KAYLEIGH I've stopped a hundred times.
EVAN So how's Tommy?
KAYLEIGH They kept him in juvy for a few years.
KAYLEIGH Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question.
EVAN You still live with your dad?
Her face is betrayed by a slight tick.
KAYLEIGH No.
KAYLEIGH I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
EVAN Wow.
EVAN That must've taken some courage.
KAYLEIGH Not if you remember my dad.
EVAN Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
KAYLEIGH She had a new family.
KAYLEIGH Not enough space for me.
KAYLEIGH Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids.
KAYLEIGH But...
KAYLEIGH whatever.
They walk in silence for a moment.
EVAN Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
KAYLEIGH Me?
KAYLEIGH Are you kidding?
KAYLEIGH Why?
EVAN Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
KAYLEIGH Of course.
EVAN Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular.
EVAN It'd be a big help.
KAYLEIGH Well, sure.
KAYLEIGH I'll try to remember.
KAYLEIGH Shoot.
EVAN When we were kids.
EVAN Your dad was making a movie.
EVAN Robin Hood or something?
KAYLEIGH What do you want to know, Evan?
EVAN It's just...
EVAN did he...
EVAN what happened in the basement?
KAYLEIGH It was a long time ago.
EVAN I know, but...
KAYLEIGH Is that why you came all the way back?
KAYLEIGH To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
EVAN No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
Kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette.
KAYLEIGH Is there a point to any of this?
Evan's features shift from inquisitory to tenderness.
He steps closer to Kayleigh and softly strokes her face.
She flinches at first, but remains in the same spot.
EVAN Whatever happened, it wasn't our fault.
EVAN You know we couldn't have stopped it.
Kayleigh begins to tremble.
Tears flow.
EVAN Look, Kayleigh.
EVAN This may sound like bullshit coming from a guy who hasn't spoken to you in seven years...
She moves her face away from his hand.
EVAN But you were seven years old and there's nothing you could've done to deserve...
Her face collapses and she turns away.
KAYLEIGH Just shut up, Evan.
KAYLEIGH You're wasting your breath.
EVAN You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
KAYLEIGH Who are you trying to convince, Evan?!
KAYLEIGH You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!?
KAYLEIGH You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now?
KAYLEIGH Well fuck you, Evan!
KAYLEIGH Nothing's gonna be all better!
KAYLEIGH Okay?!
KAYLEIGH Nothing ever gets better!
Kayleigh runs, stops and turns back to Evan.
KAYLEIGH If I was so wonderful, Evan, why didn't you ever call me?
KAYLEIGH Why'd you leave me here to rot?!
She turns and runs away.
Evan looks sick with guilt.
A few GREEKS play frisbee and talk trash.
Evan, tired and depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn scar on his belly.
Contemplating...
Evan enters his dorm.
He ignores Thumper, who sits on Evan's bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong.
He chokes out a message.
THUMPER Some dude left a message for you.
Evan puts a towel under the door.
EVAN You can smell it all the way in the bathroom.
Evan hits "play" on the answering machine.
ANSWERING MACHINE Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter.
ANSWERING MACHINE Just wondered why you didn't hand in your essay this afternoon.
ANSWERING MACHINE I was a bit concerned.
ANSWERING MACHINE Call me to schedule a make-up.
BEEP.
Thumper offers Evan a magnified frown of disapproval.
ANSWERING MACHINE What did you say to my sister motherfucker?!
ANSWERING MACHINE Last night she cried on the phone for over an hour to me.
ANSWERING MACHINE She said you came and saw her last night.
Thumper coughs accidentally, tips the bong over on Evan's bed.
Reacting quickly, he grabs a towel from under the door and wipes off Evan's comforter.
ANSWERING MACHINE She...
ANSWERING MACHINE she fucking killed herself tonight.
ANSWERING MACHINE She's dead.
ANSWERING MACHINE And so are you.
BEEP.
Evan stares dumbstruck at the machine.
THUMPER Whoa, bad news, bro.
THUMPER I don't think this is gonna come out.
Evan, dressed in black, gets out of his car at the edge of the cemetery.
A small cluster of friends and family gather at the grave.
Evan grabs a bouquet of roses and begins walking to the grave.
When he suddenly spots Mr. Miller and Tommy.
Evan's hands tense up into fists.
He becomes weak in the knees and stops walking.
After an uncomfortable moment of standing still, he retreats to his car and watches the ceremony from the driver's seat.
The last of the mourners are filing away.
Evan exits his car and walks to the deserted grave.
He drops the roses on the casket and turns to make sure nobody is watching.
Evan reaches into his pocket and pulls out a sheet of paper.
He unfolds it and leaves it on her gravesite:
"I'll come back for you."
He makes a weighty decision and gets up.
He hastily hunts through his journals, looking for a certain book.
Evan opens his journal marked "Age 7".
He plops on his bed and starts writing sideways in the margins.
EVAN (V.O.) It's been said that a person's life is little more than the sum of his experiences.
EVAN (V.O.) If that's true, then I'm not sure I know who I am anymore.
EVAN (V.O.) I definitely never knew Kayleigh.
He turns the page and begins reading the journal.
As he mouths the entry to himself, the resonance of an older man's voice seems to REVERBERATE throughout the room and the WORLD behind his head FAINTLY VIBRATES.
Mr. Miller plays with his camera and the kids are excited about playing Robin Hood in a movie.
MR. MILLER Shut up moron.
MR. MILLER Now get in your costume Evan.
Evan slowly nods and begins to strip out of his clothes.
Mr.
Miller takes a quick peek at him.
MR. MILLER I've got an idea.
MR. MILLER Let's go downstairs, it'll look more like a dungeon down there.
Mr. Miller puts the camera on a tripod in the basement.
Kayleigh and Evan sit on folding chairs in front of the camera.
Tommy stands at the top of the basement stairs, looking down.
MR. MILLER What did I say about keeping that door closed, stupid?
TOMMY But I wanna see!
MR. MILLER You're gonna see my fist in about two seconds unless you do what I tell you.
Tommy sulks and closes the door.
Mr. Miller lowers his voice and speaks to Evan and Kayleigh.
MR. MILLER Now in this part of the story, Robin Hood just married Maid Marian and they have to kiss and stuff like grown-ups do.
Kayleigh giggles and covers her mouth with her hand.
Evan looks skeptical.
MR. MILLER So take your clothes off Kayleigh.
Kayleigh stops giggling.
Evan says nothing.
MR. MILLER Come on, like when you take a bath.
MR. MILLER Don't make a deal out of it.
MR. MILLER You too, Evan.
Mr. Miller gets behind the lens.
The room is dead silent.
MR. MILLER Let's go.
Who silently opens the door at the top of the basement stairs and watches with horror.
Evan's face is flushed with rage.
He walks behind Kayleigh and cups his hands tightly around her ears.
She can't hear anything now.
EVAN What time is it?
MR. MILLER It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
EVAN Wrong answer, fuckbag.
EVAN This is the very moment of your reckoning.
EVAN In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors.
EVAN The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
The mature speech seems completely surreal coming from a seven-year old.
Mr. Miller looks around the room as if he's the butt of some sick joke.
MR. MILLER What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
EVAN It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father.
EVAN Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide.
EVAN Nice work, daddy.
MR. MILLER Who -- who are you?
Evan impatiently waves the question.
EVAN Let's just say you're being closely watched, George.
EVAN Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like...
EVAN oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter.
EVAN Sound okay to you, Papa?
MR. MILLER ...yes.
EVAN Listen close then, fuckbag.
EVAN You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
The impact of the last sentence isn't lost on Mr. Miller.
EVAN One last thing.
Evan leans over to whisper in Kayleigh's ear.
Kayleigh stares at the floor, then looks up at her father and shivers.
Kayleigh looks into Evan's eyes for support.
Evan nods go on.
His confidence brings a boldness to her lips.
KAYLEIGH Don't you ever touch me again.
MR. MILLER I -- I won't.
Kayleigh summons her own new courage.
KAYLEIGH I'm cold.
KAYLEIGH And I'm putting on my clothes.
As he leaves to pick up her clothes, Evan grins.
EVAN What you need to do is discipline your son Tommy, because the kid's one sadistic pup.
Hiding at the top of the basement stairs, Tommy recoils in horror and picks up one of his sister's dolls and begins twisting the head back and forth...
A broad smile lines Evan's face as he slowly wakes up from his slumber.
He suddenly grabs his head as if suffering from a pounding migraine.
Quick cuts and flashes of Evan and Kayleigh growing older -- she seems more carefree now, full of life and less self- conscious.
Evan pulls Kayleigh around in a little red wagon.
Evan and Kayleigh play in a tub of balls in the playroom.
Kayleigh pushes Evan on a tire swing.
Tommy, glaring at Evan, thrashes the Teen Punk.
Burning sack in flames.
QUICK FLASH of the U-Haul driving away.
At thirteen, Kayleigh spunkily hops off a GREYHOUND BUS and runs into Evan's arms.
Still thirteen, Evan peddles his bike by his new house, Kayleigh riding on the handlebars.
More memory flashes of Evan and Kayleigh throughout the teen years, they grow up as lovers now:
Evan and Kayleigh have romantic picnic on a rowboat.
Evan and Kayleigh watch the sunrise after senior prom.
Finally the memory assault is over.
Evan groans in pain as blood trickles from his nose.
An arm reaches over and touches his shoulder.
KAYLEIGH Honey, are you all right?
Evan whips around to see Kayleigh watching him.
Not only is Kayleigh alive, but she's a ravishing beauty.
Evan lurches back from the shock of seeing Kayleigh and falls to the floor.
She sees Evan's nose bleed and her eyes go wide.
KAYLEIGH Oh my God, Evan.
KAYLEIGH You're bleeding!
KAYLEIGH Look at you!
Evan, still stunned, can do little but stare from the floor.
EVAN Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...
EVAN Incredible.
KAYLEIGH Mmmm...
KAYLEIGH You give good compliment.
KAYLEIGH Clean up and come back to bed.
He stands in the middle of her bedroom, surrounded by sorority plaques and pink preppy decor.
Evan, hardly able to take his eyes off her as she hands him a tissue.
He reaches for his clothes at the foot of the bed and comes up with a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and brown suede jacket.
EVAN Where...
EVAN where are my clothes?
KAYLEIGH Those are your clothes, silly.
Evan frowns with distaste, grabs a towel and heads out.
At the sink, Evan washes the blood off his face and looks at his reflection in the mirror.
A nearby shower SHUTS OFF.
EVAN This is too amazing!
EVAN Un-fucking-real!
WOMAN'S VOICE I wish I could get so excited about a nose bleed.
Evan turns around and sees Gwen, one of the sorority brats from the bar, exit the shower naked.
EVAN Whoops.
EVAN Sorry.
EVAN My bad.
Evan blushes and turns back to the mirror through which Gwen dries herself with a towel while staring flirtatiously back at Evan.
EVAN Hey, you were with those assholes who threw popcorn at Thumper.
Evan holds his temple in pain as another memory comes to him.
EVAN And your name is...
EVAN Gwen!
GWEN Seriously, Evan.
GWEN Lay off the blow.
She pats his ass and exits the bathroom.
Kayleigh, wearing a long skirt and tight red sweater, catches the eye of every guy on campus.
She and Evan stroll arm in arm through the quad.
Somehow, the world seems brighter now.
Even the colors seem more vibrant when compared to the somewhat grimmer world we've known.
MANY STUDENTS wave to Evan and call his name.
He can't remember all their names but it's kinda cool being the BMOC.
Evan takes a long look at her and becomes curious.
EVAN Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
KAYLEIGH Well I remember he had one...
KAYLEIGH but he, like, put it away after the first day.
KAYLEIGH Why would that freak me out?
EVAN I dunno.
EVAN Just being weird.
Kayleigh playfully sweeps her leg around to kick him on the ass, then smiles as if a ghost must have done it.
KAYLEIGH Such a goofus.
KAYLEIGH See you tonight.
Kayleigh gives him a big unexpected kiss and walks away.
After a moment of wow, Evan runs off to class himself.
Evan inserts his last quarter into the lobby pay phone and dials a telephone number.
EVAN Come on, Mom, be there!
ANSWERING MACHINE Andrea,
ANSWERING MACHINE Evan, (a strange, older man's voice) And Chuck,
ANSWERING MACHINE Aren't home right now.
ANSWERING MACHINE You know what to do.
EVAN Hi, Mom and, uh, Chuck.
EVAN Just calling to say hi and well, call me.
Evan hangs up the phone, then checks his watch.
No, wrist.
At that moment, Thumper passes Evan in the lobby.
EVAN Thumper!
EVAN What time is it, man?
Thumper eyes this strange preppy kid with distaste.
THUMPER Whasamatter?
THUMPER Lost your Rolex?
EVAN Huh?
THUMPER Fuck off, frat boy.
Thumper walks away, leaving Evan dumbfounded.
Evan runs into the lecture hall and gets in line behind other STUDENTS who are taking No.
2 pencils from a box on Professor Carter's desk.
Evan hears PEOPLE he cannot see calling his name.
Somehow, it's more creepy than cool.
The Professor makes a loud announcement.
PROFESSOR CARTER Remember, everyone!
PROFESSOR CARTER Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
EVAN I still owe you an essay from last week.
EVAN Is there any way I could get an extension?
PROFESSOR CARTER And you are...?
EVAN Evan Treborn.
PROFESSOR CARTER The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn.
PROFESSOR CARTER Now take a seat.
PROFESSOR CARTER The exam's about to begin.
Evan walks up the aisle and takes a seat.
As he sits down, someone puts his ARM menacingly around Evan's throat.
Evan flinches, turns around and sees Hunter, the frat guy Thumper assaulted the other night at Dirty Hank's bar.
EVAN Leave me alone, asshole.
EVAN I didn't lay a hand on you, okay?
Hunter bursts out laughing.
HUNTER Evan, you're hysterical.
HUNTER You study for this?
EVAN We'll find out soon enough.
HUNTER Me neither.
Hunter surreptitiously hands Evan a cheat-sheet to the exam.
Evan's face brightens.
EVAN You're kidding.
EVAN Are these the answers?!
HUNTER Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
EVAN Thanks.
EVAN Wow.
EVAN Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow.
EVAN If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
HUNTER I'd say blow me.
HUNTER Get the pledges to do it.
Evan nods and smiles as exams are passed down his row.
Evan and Kayleigh have just finished having sex.
She seems incredibly satisfied, but he looks slightly uncomfortable.
KAYLEIGH Oh my God, that was good.
KAYLEIGH Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
EVAN So it didn't feel...
EVAN weird?
KAYLEIGH Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
She giggles and snuggles into him.
He's grateful for her affection, but still looks uneasy.
The PHONE RINGS and he automatically answers it.
EVAN Yellow.
Silence on the other end.
More silence.
KAYLEIGH Fuck 'em.
As Evan hangs up, he and Kayleigh share a giggle and he resumes snuggle position.
EVAN What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect?
EVAN Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
KAYLEIGH As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you.
KAYLEIGH What's he gonna do to me?
Evan smiles to himself.
And hugs her tighter.
EVAN You think we'll always be together?
For the first time she looks at him with concern.
KAYLEIGH That is the plan, right?
KAYLEIGH Hell or high water?
He's in heaven, but plays it cool.
EVAN Just making sure.
The pledges of Theta Chi busily gather around Evan, their clothes covered in dirt, food and what might be vomit.
Evan, now dressed like his usual self, bangs a wooden spoon on a metal salad bowl that a poor THETA CHI PLEDGE wears as a hat.
EVAN Order, order.
EVAN So all you rushes know what you've got to do for me?
THETA CHI PLEDGE Pledges, Sir Brother Evan, Sir.
EVAN Pledges, rushees, same difference.
EVAN Now this is a one-time deal.
EVAN You do all this for me and I'll never give you shit again.
EVAN Promise.
A buzz of excitement runs through the pledges.
It's peaceful now.
Evan covers Kayleigh's eyes with his hands as he leads her through the attic hallways.
Both are dressed to the nines.
KAYLEIGH I don't understand, where are you taking me?
EVAN You'll see.
The wooden door to the rooftop swings open, revealing Kayleigh and Evan.
Kayleigh is dazzled by what she sees:
The entire roof is decorated with fairy-lights, Chinese lanterns and hundreds upon hundreds of candles.
And elegant romantic table for two awaits them, flanked by twelve FORMALLY DRESSED SERVANTS (previously seen pledges) who respectfully stare ahead with the utmost class.
Two pledges immediately pull out two chairs and stand by.
Kayleigh applauds and laughs with delight.
KAYLEIGH I don't know what to say.
KAYLEIGH It's beautiful.
EVAN Go on.
EVAN Sit down.
As she takes a step toward the table -- FLOWER PETALS shower down on her.
She looks up to see TWO MORE PLEDGES standing on ladders, delicately tossing pedals.
Kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down.
KAYLEIGH Why are you doing all this for me?
EVAN Simple math.
EVAN When I woke up this morning and saw your smile...
EVAN I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely.
Her eyes tell him she feels the same way.
A magical moment.
And they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it might as well be their first ever --
Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time.
HUNTER We been lookin' all over for you, man.
SENIOR BROTHER Someone trashed your car.
The moment's gone.
Evan and Kayleigh exchange worried looks.
Evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked at the bottom of the hill.
His face collapses.
Evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass.
The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the roof.
The most unnerving thing, however, is a SPIKED LEATHER DOG COLLAR hangs off the rearview mirror.
By now a crowd has gathered.
Evan runs up to people.
EVAN Did you see who did this?
EVAN You see anyone?
No one will answer with anything more than a shrug.
HUNTER Probably them Pika fuckers.
But Kayleigh knows better.
She stares at the collar.
EVAN How could he get away with this?
EVAN Right in front of the goddamn frat house!
A SENIOR BROTHER angrily calls him from the lawn.
SENIOR BROTHER Frat house?
SENIOR BROTHER Hey man, would you call your "country" a "cunt"?
Kayleigh shudders and Evan puts his arms around her.
KAYLEIGH Don't.
KAYLEIGH He's probably watching.
Evan leads Kayleigh into his bedroom and shuts the door.
Evan can't help but look under the bed.
No one.
He then locks the door, reaches into his desk and finds a tiny canister of Pepper Spray.
KAYLEIGH It's my fault.
KAYLEIGH I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
EVAN Might'a been nice.
EVAN Like this is gonna do any good.
EVAN Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
KAYLEIGH Please, Evan.
KAYLEIGH Don't even joke.
KAYLEIGH He wouldn't hurt you.
KAYLEIGH He's just trying to scare you away from me.
EVAN Yeah, right.
EVAN Tell that to Crockett.
KAYLEIGH It's not his fault, Evan.
KAYLEIGH You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
EVAN Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
KAYLEIGH My father never laid a hand on me.
KAYLEIGH It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
Evan sits in silence for a moment, contemplating this.
Kayleigh's eyes plead for him to have compassion.
EVAN Fine, then.
EVAN We'll let campus security deal with him.
Kayleigh and Evan walk through the all-but-deserted campus.
Evan seems especially paranoid.
In the distance, some guy vomits loudly.
KAYLEIGH Are you okay?
EVAN What do you mean?
KAYLEIGH It's just...
KAYLEIGH you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
EVAN Like how?
KAYLEIGH I don't know.
KAYLEIGH You seem...
KAYLEIGH different.
KAYLEIGH You make weird jokes.
KAYLEIGH Your accents changed.
KAYLEIGH You don't even walk the same.
EVAN I walk differently?
KAYLEIGH I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off.
KAYLEIGH Even the dinner tonight.
KAYLEIGH It was beautiful, but...
EVAN I know I've been actin strange lately.
EVAN It's just that...
EVAN I don't want anything to happen to us.
The guy along the path gags loudly into the bushes.
Kayleigh and Evan instinctively avert their eyes.
Suddenly, Kayleigh's ears perk and she stops walking mid-stride.
KAYLEIGH Wait.
KAYLEIGH Something's not right.
KAYLEIGH Isn't that your jacket?
EVAN What?
The guy, wearing Evan's brown suede jacket, suddenly springs to his feet, revealing his face for the first time.
KAYLEIGH Tommy.
Tommy has grown in the last seven years.
He has long, greasy hair and some tattoos.
He holds a TIRE THUMPER (a short, steel bat for truckers) menacingly in his right hand.
Evan stands frozen in fear, his hands rooted in his coat pockets.
EVAN Leave us alone you sick fuck!
TOMMY Get this "us" shit.
TOMMY As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister.
TOMMY You've done nicely for yourself, Evan.
TOMMY Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister.
TOMMY Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
KAYLEIGH Shut up, Tommy!
TOMMY Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Tommy takes a few practice swings with the tire thumper.
EVAN What the hell are you doing?
TOMMY It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
EVAN No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
TOMMY Right, Evan.
TOMMY I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Tommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in the shoulder and ribs.
Evan goes down.
As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face.
Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free hand.
Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy, keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with Pepper Spray.
Kayleigh screams.
Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly swinging the tire thumper.
Evan charges forward in an uncontrollable rage, rips the weapon out of Tommy's hands and sprays a lethal dose of pepper spray into Tommy's open mouth.
KAYLEIGH Evan, stop!
KAYLEIGH You're gonna kill him!
EVAN He's a fucking maniac!
Evan knocks Tommy down with the tire thumper.
Kayleigh screams and tries to hold Evan back, but he easily wrestles free of her.
She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad.
EVAN He ruined Lenny's life --
Evan kicks Tommy hard in the ribs.
Kayleigh pushes a button on the "Blue Light" lamp post and an ALARM WAILS.
EVAN He killed Crockett --
EVAN Murdered that woman and her baby!
EVAN And he's trying to kill me, Kayleigh!
EVAN He's trying to fucking kill me!
Evan raises the tire thumper for a final attack and swings down OFF CAMERA.
Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified.
Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother.
And stops cold when she sees the damage to Tommy.
Evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a crablike fashion.
SIRENS come racing to the quad.
Evan looks away from Tommy's limp body.
Collapses to the ground and begins to weep.
A SECURITY VEHICLE pulls through the ominous metal gates of the large state prison.
The vehicle stops and Evan, along with nine other convicts, exit in leg and hand restraints.
Evan, now wearing his standard issue inmate uniform, enters the General Population area of the prison.
PRISONERS begin screaming vicious taunts and catcalls at the fresh batch of new inmates.
Evan tries to keep composed and walks toward his cell.
Evan looks up to see one of the men leaning over the second tier, KARL, a huge muscular con with tattoos of swastikas and other Nazi symbols on his arm, blows a kiss at Evan and winks.
Evan enters a dimly lit cell plastered with pictures of Jesus Christ and various Saints.
Burning flames on open cans of shoe polish serve as candles to the large shrine.
There is a stained bare mattress on the top bunk.
Sitting on the bottom bunk is CARLOS, 30s, a massive Hispanic convict covered with faded Indian ink jail tats of Christ in agony.
Carlos stares at Evan disinterestedly as Evan makes up his bed on the top bunk.
CARLOS First time?
Evan nods glumly.
CARLOS Best not bitch up.
CARLOS Wind up someone's luggage that way.
EVAN Can you protect me?
CARLOS Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood.
CARLOS When they come, just put your mind in another place, man.
CARLOS Be somewhere else.
A BUZZER SOUNDS.
Carlos leaves the cell without another word.
Evan sets his tray down at a table filled with Carlos and some other INMATES.
No sooner has he sat down to eat, do eager forks reach onto his tray and steal his food.
Carlos shrugs at Evan and offers him a roll.
Andrea sits across from Evan in the visitor's chamber.
Her hair is now bottle-blonde.
Four inches of Plexiglas separate the two and they talk on monitored phones.
Andrea, frazzled, twirls an unlit cigarette.
ANDREA ...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal.
ANDREA He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
EVAN How long will I be in here?
ANDREA I don't know.
ANDREA These things take time.
EVAN How's Kayleigh doing?
EVAN She all right?
Andrea's look tells him to look for hope elsewhere.
EVAN What about my journals, Mom?
EVAN Did you bring the ones I asked for?
Andrea nods, holding up two comp books.
"AGE 7" and "AGE
ANDREA I found these.
ANDREA The others are still in storage.
EVAN Damn it, Mom.
EVAN I told you I need them all!
ANDREA Fine.
ANDREA You'll get them, Evan.
ANDREA But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
Evan looks as if he's about to disagree with her, but he closes his mouth and placates her.
EVAN Sure, Mom.
EVAN You're right.
EVAN Just try to tell Kayleigh I'm sorry.
And officer signals Evan and points to his watch.
ANDREA I'm not gonna lose you, kiddo.
ANDREA Promise me you'll hang on, Ev.
They look at each other and Evan slowly lowers the phone.
He hangs up, Andrea still pressing her phone to her ear.
Evan walks closely behind Carlos through a corridor, clutching his journals.
As he passes Karl, the Neo-Nazi, Karl reaches over and firmly grabs Evan's crotch.
Evan, totally violated, turns white with rage.
KARL Shit on my dick or blood on my knife.
Evan stands there, stunned, unable to react when --
Another Neo-Nazi, RICK, swats Evan's journals out of his hands and onto the floor.
Life springs back into Evan as he rushes for the journals.
He and Rick grab the journals at the same time.
A minor tug of war.
EVAN Let go!
EVAN They're mine!
Rick tears them away, Evan coming up with only a few torn pages.
Evan sees the damage and goes mental.
EVAN Motherfucker!
Evan swings at Rick and misses.
INMATES CHEER!
It's on!
Rick lunges for Evan, a brief and painful scuffle ensues, the journals getting trampled.
Suddenly -- The sounds of COCKED RIFLES echo through the air.
The fight stops instantly as Rick and Evan look up to see --
OFFICER STATION.
Officers aim rifles at the pair.
From an upper tier, even more officers with more rifles.
Their barrels sight directly at Evan.
Rick steps away, quick to maliciously scoop up Evan's torn journals.
KARL We'll be comin' for you tonight, sister.
Evan catches his breath, then looks at the remaining few pages on the floor.
Evan enters the cell with a few entry pages.
He looks through them.
Nothing there.
Evan nods depressed, then sees the page from his "Age 7" journal, grabs Carlos' duct tape and tapes the page over his bed.
Evan, walking toward some White Supremacists, flinches whenever the occasional INMATE brushes against him.
Evan is completely paranoid, waiting for an inevitable attack.
Karl makes himself visible among them, holding a journal.
He reads:
KARL Today I found my grandfather's death certificate.
KARL He died in a nut house, just like my father.
KARL Mom denies it, but she thinks I'm gonna end up the same way...
The other Supremacists start laughing and calling "looney" and "nut job."
Evan rushes past them and they make chicken clucks at him.
Evan and Carlos sit on BLEACHERS that overlook the other prisoners working out.
Evan closely watches Karl and Rick who stare daggers at him from across the yard.
A SKINHEAD PASSES SOMETHING with a white-taped handle to Karl but no officers seem to notice.
Evan slides closer to Carlos and stares at the Jesus Christ tattoos all over Carlos' back.
EVAN You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
CARLOS Straight up.
EVAN Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose.
EVAN For you to help me.
CARLOS Shit.
CARLOS I knew you were crazy.
EVAN I ain't bullshitting.
EVAN Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
Carlos scoffs whatever.
EVAN Pack of smokes says I can prove it to you.
Carlos is suddenly interested.
Evan holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and finishes up a conversation.
Carlos looks dumbfounded.
EVAN So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
CARLOS You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Their conversation stops when a convict rolls a mail cart by, Evan looking up expectantly.
EVAN Anything today?
CONVICT Yep.
CONVICT Just not for you.
Disappointed, Evan turns back to Carlos.
Holds up his journal entry.
EVAN Just tell me if anything weird happens.
CARLOS Weirder than this?
EVAN Marks, scars, I dunno.
EVAN Anything could happen I guess.
Evan studies the page.
"On Wednesday I got in trouble for a drawing that I didn't do.
Mommy wont let me see it."
Then as he starts reading it to himself, the bars behind him almost imperceptibly VIBRATE --
Evan, seven, COMES TO in an old familiar place.
WE are back in Mrs. Boswell's first grade class.
All of the children draw colorful pictures.
Evan sees some paper spindles sitting on Mrs. Boswell's desk.
As he heads over to them, Mrs. Boswell firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own desk.
MRS. BOSWELL No monkey business, Evan.
MRS. BOSWELL Sit still and finish your drawing.
Evan, defeated, looks over at his blank piece of paper.
He smiles mischievously, and grabs some colored pencils.
MRS. BOSWELL That's great everyone!
MRS. BOSWELL Just imagine anything you want to be.
MRS. BOSWELL There are no limits.
Soon enough, an image emerges: Evan holding a knife, stands over a heap of several dead inmates Karl and Rick.
When done, he sneaks over to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where the two paper spindles sit.
The metal needles reach up and skewer a number of paper notes and messages.
Evan looks over to see Mrs. Boswell holding up his drawing, horrified.
EVAN Oh, Mrs. Boswelllllllll?
She looks over in time to see Evan using all of his seven- year old strength to WHIP his hands down toward the spindles!
The moment before his palms reach them there's a brief instant where SOUNDSCAPES COLLIDE and the world behind him VIBRATES.
Evan comes to as ECHOES OF SCREAMING CHILDREN FADE.
Alertness slowly creeps back up on him as he hears:
CARLOS Oh sweet Jesus.
CARLOS It's true.
CARLOS It's a miracle!
CARLOS A miracle!
Evan looks up to see Carlos staring at him with reverence.
CARLOS Your hands.
CARLOS The stigmata!
Evan looks to see two scars in the center of each palm.
EVAN What did you see?
EVAN What did it look like?
CARLOS Signs of the Lord.
CARLOS They just appeared out of nowhere.
CARLOS I thought you were loco!
EVAN So you believe me?
Carlos simply stares at him, awestruck, and hands over a box of cigarettes.
Evan nervously approaches.
A CREW of Aryans block his path.
EVAN I want to make a deal.
The Aryans laugh, make discrete eye contact with Karl, who grins and signals to let Evan pass.
Karl and Rick wait expectantly as Evan nervously enters.
They say nothing, relishing the fearful silence.
EVAN Look.
EVAN I'm new to all this but I think I get how things work.
EVAN You gotta join a gang or else end up dead meat.
They continue to stare.
EVAN Well it sure ain't gonna fucking be with no niggers or spics.
EVAN So how do we do this?
EVAN You gotta work your way up, and I'm the new guy.
EVAN So...
EVAN should I...
EVAN I mean, do I suck your dicks right now?
Karl and Rick exchange looks.
KARL Is your blood pure?
EVAN I ain't no fucking kike if that's what you mean.
Rick stands.
All muscle.
RICK Let's see what you got.
RICK And watch the fucking teeth or you'll be leaving without 'em.
Evan nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees.
Karl and Rick lower their pants to their ankles.
Evan looks miserable, about to do the deed when -- CARLOS bulldozes past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch!
Rick instantly charges Carlos, but trips on the pants around his ankles.
Evan, anticipating Rick's fall, stomps Rick's face before snatching his journals from Karl's shelf.
Evan frantically flips through them, hunting for something, as the other WHITE SUPREMACISTS charge the cell.
EVAN Carlos!
Carlos drops Karl's writhing body to the floor and presses his girth against the cell door.
Evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as the other supremacists force the door open -- Evan focuses on the words.
Chanting quickly.
EVAN We took the woods behind the junkyard just to make sure we wouldn't bump into Tommy.
EVAN We hadn't seen the smoke yet.
WORDS from the entry begin to SHIMMER.
REVERBERANT SOUNDS OF BARKING break the sound barrier and the image of Aryans storming the cell behind him become a FRENETIC BLUR
Evan, thirteen again, comes to in the woods.
Evan stumbles at first, then rights himself.
He seems strangely exhilarated.
A sinister victory smile.
EVAN Rot in hell you fucking animals.
Kayleigh and Lenny, walking by his side, do a double take.
Evan shrugs "just kidding" and looks around, getting his bearings.
He whips his hand out and stops them.
EVAN Wait.
EVAN Before we --
He suddenly notices Kayleigh who now no longer looks an awkward and unkempt tomboy, but rather a vibrant and feminine young girl.
Whereas her clothes were loose and unflattering before, she is now radiant and wears fashionable styles.
Evan remembers his mission and darts over to a JUNK PILE.
EVAN We need something to cut open the sack!
Kayleigh and Lenny stare at him, concerned for his sanity.
Evan roots through the trash until he finds something: a razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long.
Evan offers it to Lenny.
EVAN I want you to take this, Lenny.
EVAN Today's your day of atonement.
EVAN I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
KAYLEIGH Evan.
KAYLEIGH Stop it.
KAYLEIGH It's not the time.
EVAN Now's the only time!
EVAN Today you get a chance to redeem yourself.
EVAN Start over with a clean slate.
EVAN Tabula rasa --
LENNY What are you talking about?
KAYLEIGH You're acting crazy!
EVAN Please.
EVAN If you've ever trusted me before, trust me on this one.
Evan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand.
EVAN Cut the rope.
Lenny slowly follows Evan as he bolts away.
Evan groans on the ground, writhing.
Tommy's voice hitches, eyes watering from pent up frustration.
TOMMY Listen to me good, Evan...
EVAN I'll do whatever you want.
EVAN You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine.
EVAN Just let Crockett go.
EVAN Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure.
EVAN And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Evan's words hit home and Tommy's anger slowly dissipates.
A look of understanding passes between them.
Gratitude, even.
Tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it.
Lenny comes screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell!
With all of the force he can muster, he jams the metal shard all the way through Tommy's throat!
Tommy clutches his throat, gagging in blood.
Evan surveys the scene in shock:
EVAN Oh fuck, Lenny, no!
Lenny drops to the floor, Indian style, wipes the dirt in his hands and freezes up completely.
Kayleigh wakes up and SCREAMS when she sees blood spurt from Tommy's throat.
Meanwhile, Crockett escapes from the sack.
Lenny, silhouetted by the sky, seems to vibrate violently as if operating a jack-hammer.
Evan comes to in a familiar place.
His original college dorm -
EVAN Christ.
EVAN Help me.
He sits upright in bed and takes in his surroundings.
When suddenly, Evan clutches his head in severe pain.
Color memories of Kayleigh's sorority fade to BLACK and WHITE and dissipate.
Memories of Evan's vandalized car fade to BLACK and WHITE and dissipate.
The faces of Karl and Rick all turn grainy...
As new images of THUMPER become more BRILLIANT.
A new image overwhelms the others: Lenny, 13, with dark, soulless eyes wearing a straight-jacket in a padded room.
Evan's eyes roll back in his head.
He shakes uncontrollably and blood pours from his nose.
Thumper opens the door, sees Evan convulsing and jumps back in horror.
He scans the hallways for assistance.
THUMPER Someone call 9-1-1!
Evan lies on an examining table undergoing another series of CAT-scans.
The machines are now state of the art and the lab room has been redecorated.
Andrea nervously chews her fingernails as she watches Dr.
Redfield post CAT-scan results on the light box.
A young nurse pushes Evan, in a wheelchair, into the doctor's office.
EVAN Okay, doc.
EVAN What's the damage?
EVAN How much time have I got?
ANDREA Cute, Evan.
DR. REDFIELD It's a little complicated.
DR. REDFIELD I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
EVAN Are you sure?
EVAN Not even with my father?
Dr. Redfield and Andrea exchange looks.
DR. REDFIELD Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
ANDREA So what did you find.
Dr. Redfield points to the CAT-scan slides, specifically, to the outer lining of Evan's brain.
DR. REDFIELD This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging.
DR. REDFIELD The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
EVAN Lemme guess.
EVAN Would that be where the memories are stored?
Dr. Redfield stares ahead.
Transfixed by the slides.
DR. REDFIELD I've never seen anything like this.
DR. REDFIELD I've compared these to the ones taken last year, and there's evidence of severe hemorrhaging and massive neural reconstruction.
Andrea stares at him blankly.
Evan impatiently "pops wheelies" in the wheel chair.
ANDREA What does that mean for Evan?
EVAN He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year.
EVAN Overload city.
EVAN 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Dr. Redfield nods, awed by Evan's effortless interpretation.
Evan springs out of the wheelchair and stretches his legs.
EVAN Mind if I wait in the car?
EVAN The lighting here bugs my eyes.
Andrea nods.
Evan shakes Dr. Redfield's hand.
EVAN Well, it's nice seeing you again.
EVAN But you know, people to see, things to read...
Andrea shoots Dr. Redfield an apologetic look.
Evan heads out the door, accidentally knocking Dr. Redfield's jacket to the floor.
He shrugs apologetically and re-hangs it.
Outside the office, Evan inspects Dr. Redfield's KEYS and attached SECURITY CARD and smiles.
Evan covertly winds himself through the maze of corridors, careful not to be seen by the staff.
He finally sees a wing marked "CRIMINALLY INSANE".
Evan looks around to make certain he's not being watched, then uses the security card to open the door.
He looks in every room of the wing until he finds --
Evan unlocks the door and is moved by what he sees.
Lenny is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in tight leather restraints.
The dark five o'clock shadow and his malicious grin radiate evil.
His black and haunting eyes personify hate and murderous intent.
Lenny seems neither surprised or happy to see Evan.
That is, if he's aware of Evan's presence at all...
EVAN Is there anything you need?
EVAN Anything I can get you?
Nothing from Lenny.
EVAN What about the models, man?
EVAN Bet I can get you a shitload of models up in here.
Still nothing.
Not even a glance in his direction.
Evan sighs and gives up.
EVAN Okay, Lenny.
EVAN Just wanted to say "hi".
Evan turns around to leave.
LENNY You knew the whole time, didn't you?
LENNY When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen.
LENNY Didn't you?!
EVAN Y...
EVAN yes.
EVAN I guess I did.
Lenny's eyes seethe with hate.
LENNY Then you should be where I am.
LENNY You should be where I am.
Evan backs away, face guilt-stricken.
Evan enters his dormroom (where everything's backwards), reaches under his bed and is relieved to find the journal marked "AGE 7".
Evan is ignored by several Theta Chi pledges as he plops himself by a tree and hunts through his journal to find the entry from when he was seven and visited Jason at Sunnyvale.
"Today I get to mete my father.
His name is Jason and he is crazy.
I hope he lets me call him dad."
Evan takes a calming breath and begins reading.
EVAN Today I get to meet my father.
EVAN His name is Jason and he is crazy...
Evan gets some strange looks, but continues.
As he does, the trees and frisbee-playing students behind him VIBRATE and
Seven-year old Evan comes to during the time he first met his father, Jason.
Jason waits patiently for young Evan to finish his sentence.
JASON Are you okay?
JASON You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
EVAN Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
Jason is completely thrown.
JASON I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
EVAN But it didn't.
EVAN And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
JASON There is no "right".
JASON When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
EVAN Who's to say you can't make things better?
Jason seems extremely upset to hear Evan say this.
JASON You can't play God, son.
JASON It must end with me.
JASON Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
EVAN Bullshit.
EVAN I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Jason launches himself across the table, shackles and all, and grabs hold of Evan's throat.
As Jason looks down at us, frothing at the mouth, there's a trick of the light where Jason's head seems to VIBRATE against the ceiling.
Evan's hands instinctively reach for his throat, then he realizes his surroundings.
Heartbroken, he shuts the journal and stands up shakily.
Evan eats in the same diner where Kayleigh used to work.
As he eats, his arm sits in front of his plate, protectively.
Guarding his food.
WAITRESS Just get out, didja?
EVAN Huh?
WAITRESS Nothing.
WAITRESS Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
EVAN I come from a big family.
WAITRESS Meant no offense.
EVAN None taken.
EVAN Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
WAITRESS Sorry.
WAITRESS Never heard of her.
Evan slowly walks up the driveway, which is now a dilapidated mess.
Garbage litters the front lawn and paint chips rot off the sides of the house.
Inside, Mr. Miller yells at someone.
MR. MILLER Just shut the hell up already!
MR. MILLER Can't a man get a little goddman peace in his own home!
MR. MILLER Oh, for Christ's sake, now what?
Mr. Miller opens the door and sees Evan.
MR. MILLER Don't suppose you're here to sell cookies?
In a blur, Evan grabs Mr. Miller's shirt and violently shoves him through the house and into a wall.
EVAN Good guess, fuckbag.
EVAN Remember me now?
EVAN We had a great chat once when I was seven.
Mr. Miller goes slack, his eyes wide with horror.
EVAN One question, fuckbag.
EVAN Where can I find your daughter?
Evan walks past some junkies and enters.
Evan steps over some passed out bodies that litter the hallway of an incredibly seedy motel.
The kind with hourly rates.
He knocks on a door.
Kayleigh, now haggard, strung-out junkie, opens the door and immediately the contempt for Evan grows in her eyes.
She puts out an expression of disappointment.
KAYLEIGH Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock.
KAYLEIGH Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
EVAN Nice to see you, too.
EVAN Can I come in?
She looks around, waves him in.
KAYLEIGH If I knew you were coming I'd have cleaned the stains off the sheets.
The room is dirty and sparse, excepting charred-bottom spoons, yellowed cotton balls and brown-spotted squares of tin foil.
Evan doesn't hesitate to sit on the "soiled" bed.
KAYLEIGH What do you want?
Evan can't speak.
His eyes begin to water.
EVAN I just needed to see...
EVAN a friendly face.
His sincerity touches her.
KAYLEIGH Well, time is money, Evan.
KAYLEIGH So you...
Evan reaches for his wallet and throws it on her dresser.
Kayleigh eyes the wallet.
But makes no move to pick it up.
KAYLEIGH Well, I guess I can spare ten minutes for an old friend, right?
Tears fall freely from Evan's eyes.
KAYLEIGH So how's tricks?
KAYLEIGH Sorry, occupational humor.
EVAN I get it.
EVAN You can drop it now.
KAYLEIGH Oh, I'm sorry.
KAYLEIGH Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
EVAN No.
EVAN Just that you need to hurt me with it.
EVAN I've been where you've been.
KAYLEIGH Ha!
KAYLEIGH Where's that?
EVAN The bottom.
EVAN When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Kayleigh watches Evan silently.
KAYLEIGH What's happened to you?
EVAN You wouldn't believe me.
EVAN I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
KAYLEIGH I've seen some sickening shit.
KAYLEIGH I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
EVAN Why's that?
KAYLEIGH Because you're...
KAYLEIGH different.
EVAN Different?
EVAN How?
KAYLEIGH Let me ask you a question.
KAYLEIGH Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
EVAN Yeah?
KAYLEIGH On the bridge.
KAYLEIGH How did you know that Tommy had your dog?
KAYLEIGH That was no fucking hunch.
EVAN Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
Evan continues and Kayleigh listens with a mixture of intense interest and matched skepticism.
Kayleigh finishes a plateful of food at a busy diner.
She lights up an after-dinner smoke.
KAYLEIGH You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
EVAN I never thought you would.
EVAN That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
KAYLEIGH I'm the only person you've told?
KAYLEIGH That's a great line.
KAYLEIGH Does that make other girls swoon?
KAYLEIGH Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
EVAN I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
KAYLEIGH Oh?
KAYLEIGH There's proof now?
EVAN Shit.
EVAN I dunno.
EVAN How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
KAYLEIGH Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
EVAN Then forget that.
EVAN How about...
EVAN you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
Kayleigh's jaw drops.
EVAN Oh!
EVAN And when you orgasm, your toes go numb.
EVAN I'm sure your clientele aren't privy to that one.
Kayleigh tries to conceal the surprise in her eyes.
EVAN I just thought you should know.
KAYLEIGH Know what?
EVAN That I didn't leave you there to rot.
Kayleigh flinches as if her should had been invaded, then her eyes fill with distrust and contempt.
KAYLEIGH There's one major hole in your story.
EVAN Which is?
KAYLEIGH There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
She opens Evan's wallet and leaves a twenty on the table.
KAYLEIGH Sure you don't want your wallet?
EVAN Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
KAYLEIGH Off to change everyone's life again, is that it?
KAYLEIGH Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
EVAN I'm over it.
EVAN Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
KAYLEIGH Well, don't give up now, Slick.
KAYLEIGH You've already done so much for me.
KAYLEIGH Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby.
KAYLEIGH Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
She gets up and puts on her coat.
KAYLEIGH Oh, here's one!
KAYLEIGH Go back when I'm seven and fuck me in front of Daddy's handicam, you know, straighten me out a bit...
She tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him and leaves.
Evan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar sounds of Thumper having sex with another naked GOTHIC CO- ED.
On Evan's bed.
EVAN Get out.
EVAN Both of you.
THUMPER Sorry, dude.
THUMPER Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
Evan's temper flares and he picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a wall above Thumper's head.
EVAN I'm not saying it again.
Thumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets and leave.
Alone in the room, Evan looks under his bed and breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals are intact.
He sifts through them again.
He finally finds the passage he needs.
Something catches the corner of Evan's eyes and he turns to examine it.
To the left of Thumper's Buddha statuette sits a large VOTIVE CANDLE that bears a portrait of Jesus Christ.
EVAN Lord give me the strength and guidance I need to set things right.
As he begins reading a passage to himself, SOUNDS ECHO backward at us from another time and place.
And the entire ROOM SHIMMERS around him --
Evan comes to as he, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy -- all thirteen -- watch Mrs. Halpern carry her baby back to the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation.
Evan suddenly comes to life and makes himself visible, running across the street shouting.
EVAN Lady, stay back!
EVAN Don't go near the mailbox!
Mrs. Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically as she absently continues toward the mailbox.
EVAN I mean it, woman!
EVAN Get the hell back!
Lenny comes running across the street to Evan's aid, and Tommy shrugs and follows after him.
LENNY There's a bomb in the mailbox.
LENNY Get away!
Tommy, still running, cringes to hear Lenny's stupid confession and rolls his eyes at the situation.
Evan positions himself between Mrs. Halpern and the mailbox, frantically waving his hand at her to stay back, because she's STILL
TOMMY I'll save you lady!
Tommy takes a running dive at Mrs. Halpern, perhaps a bit too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt, but no major injuries.
Seeing things are safe, Evan backs away from the mail --
The blast is deafening!
Evan's body is hurled backwards dramatically.
Evan comes to back in his dorm, the same posters are on the wall, the sheets are the same.
Even the familiar sounds of Thumper having sex under the covers.
EVAN I thought I told you two to beat it.
Evan's face falls as he hears a familiar voice, but not Thumper's.
LENNY What?
LENNY Hey, sorry, man.
LENNY We wake you up?
Evan is confused by Lenny's presence, but smiles to himself and shakes his head "no".
EVAN No, it's cool.
EVAN Really cool.
Evan yawns, bringing his hand to his mouth, but there's no hand.
No arm, really, either.
Just two FLESHY STUMPS!
Evan bolts upright in bed and stares down at his amputations.
We see countless and brief image flashes of Evan growing up from the age of thirteen with NO ARMS, and requiring a
Tommy and Kayleigh load popcorn and drinks onto Evan's lap as Lenny pushes the wheelchair.
Evan celebrates his 14th birthday and blows out the candles.
Andrea, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny all clap.
Tommy pushes Evan to church.
Evan screams as blood pours from his nose.
Lenny is out of bed at once to help him...
as is KAYLEIGH!
(Now beautiful and natural looking).
Lenny and Kayleigh, as teens, sit together with Evan at the far end of the boat.
Evan looks on longingly as Lenny and Kayleigh become lovers in high school.
A campfire.
Evan sips from a BEER CAP as Lenny and Kayleigh make out in plain sight with Tommy's bashful approval.
Evan's in agony as Kayleigh opens a series of dorm doors and Lenny rushes Evan's wheelchair through.
Kayleigh carries a pair of prosthetic arms in her hands.
Evan moans and tries to rub his temple with his stump.
EVAN Where are we going?
KAYLEIGH We have to get you to Sunnyvale.
KAYLEIGH You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
EVAN Stop!
EVAN Take me back!
LENNY Sorry, tough guy, no can do.
LENNY Your mother would kill me.
Evan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of the wheelchair.
Lenny must halt in order not to crush Evan.
As Evan writhes about on the floor, his legs paralyzed, a
Evan focuses on Lenny, but it's hard to ignore the crowd that titters and snickers in the background.
EVAN Take me back, Lenny!
EVAN You owe me that much.
Kayleigh turns to face the jeering crowd.
KAYLEIGH What are you geeks looking at?
KAYLEIGH Must be nice to be so goddamned perfect, huh?
KAYLEIGH Fucking losers.
The crowd breaks up and leaves.
It's calm now.
Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair around the quad.
Evan now wears prosthetic arms.
Random PEOPLE call out to Lenny.
He's extremely popular in this world.
LENNY 'Sup, Sheila!
LENNY We missed you at the party!
LENNY Don't even think I'm giving you my lab notes either!
LENNY Think I like getting up for "eight thirty's"?
Lenny pushes Evan past Thumper and Cricket.
Their conversation stops and they stare at their feet as Evan gets wheeled by.
Evan boils to be treated as if he were non-existent.
LENNY Hey, there's Tommy.
Evan spins around in fear.
He sees Tommy, clean-cut, and handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads "Campus Crusade for Christ."
Tommy seems good-natured now, working hard and soliciting names for his list.
He looks up as Evan rolls along and his eyes brighten to see Evan.
TOMMY I did what you said, man!
TOMMY We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
EVAN Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Tommy frowns and exchanges glances with Lenny, who shrugs and nods back to him.
LENNY Uh, we should be getting to class now.
EVAN Forget it.
EVAN What's the point of Psych now?
EVAN Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Another exchanged glance.
Kayleigh looks at Evan.
KAYLEIGH Let's go for a stroll.
Evan allows Kayleigh to roll him away from the others.
To the very spot where Evan once killed Tommy.
Evan stares at his prosthetic hand which he can "magically" will to open, close, open, close...
EVAN So Tommy's really into this Jesus kick, huh?
Kayleigh looks at him curiously.
KAYLEIGH You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
EVAN He saved Mrs. Halpern?
EVAN Please, the twisted fuck.
Kayleigh, now by a bench.
Stops and sits.
As she casually uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a granola bar and hands it to him.
His prosthetic hand crushes it.
It crumbles to dust.
She seems more confused.
KAYLEIGH Is something the matter?
EVAN Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
She leans into him, gently feeding him her remaining bar.
EVAN Kayleigh?
EVAN Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
KAYLEIGH Sure, Evan, why not?
KAYLEIGH You were the first person I really ever cared about.
EVAN I was?
KAYLEIGH That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
EVAN I don't get it.
KAYLEIGH When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with.
KAYLEIGH I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
EVAN I never knew that.
EVAN So then you still sometimes think of us...
EVAN together?
KAYLEIGH It's crossed my mind from time to time.
EVAN And...?
KAYLEIGH Well a lot of things cross my mind.
KAYLEIGH I've always been a fast thinker, Ev.
KAYLEIGH I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second.
KAYLEIGH Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit.
KAYLEIGH It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
EVAN Then you think it might have worked out?
KAYLEIGH Why not?
KAYLEIGH But that's not how things wound up.
KAYLEIGH I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend.
KAYLEIGH And there it ends.
She looks into his eyes and shrugs almost apologetically.
Tears streak down Evan's face as he speaks in a pleading tone.
EVAN Would it make any difference if I told you that no one could possibly love anyone as much as I love you?
Kayleigh shakes her head sadly, then suddenly looks up.
Evan turns to see Lenny waving her over.
She puts her hand on Evan's shoulder, stands and goes to Lenny.
Evan can't take his eyes off her.
Lenny kissing Kayleigh.
In painful slo-mo.
Evan turns away, utterly heartbroken.
Evan's stump turns on a BATHTUB FAUCET.
Evan, fully clothed, lies in a bathtub that's filling with water.
Beside the tub, the wheelchair has been tipped over.
The water rises past his mouth, to his nostrils -- Evan makes his peace and takes a final breath.
And the water spills over the side of the tub.
All Evan can do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose.
A beat.
Then the door opens.
TOMMY ENTERS.
Immediately sizing up the situation.
TOMMY You forgot to put the toaster on the edge.
Tommy casually turns off the water, then pops open the DRAIN.
The water level lowers to Evan's mouth.
EVAN But you, Kayleigh and Lenny like toast.
EVAN And that's really all that matters now.
Tommy feels Evan's anguish and plops his ass on the wet floor by the tub.
He lays his head onto Evan's shoulder.
Evan bristles at first, but finally gives in to his hatred, ultimately resting his own head against Tommy's.
Taking the comfort offered.
TOMMY I'll get you changed.
TOMMY Visiting hours are almost up.
Tommy rolls Evan through a quiet hospital corridor.
EVAN What, did mom get transferred again?
Tommy frowns, confused, then rolls Evan into --
Evan is startled to see Andrea hooked up to several IV's, an oxygen tank and a respirator.
Several oxygen hoses connect to a tracheotomy tube.
Tommy smiles and kisses Andrea on the cheek.
She tousles his hair in return.
Evan can hardly speak.
As Tommy begins to wheel Evan's chair closer to Andrea's bedside, Andrea utters a faint whisper.
ANDREA Looking.
ANDREA Good.
ANDREA Kiddo.
Evan eyes her MEDICAL CLIPBOARD as he's wheeled by.
EVAN Lung cancer?
TOMMY Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Andrea flinches to hear this.
Evan stares at her, eyes wide.
EVAN Right...
EVAN You started chain smoking after I blew myself up.
Evan suddenly seems sick with guilt.
EVAN There must be a way to fix this.
ANDREA Fix?
EVAN I just need the entry about the blockbuster.
EVAN Wait, shit, no arms.
EVAN I never even got the chance to write it.
A flicker of recognition registers in her eyes.
ANDREA Is Evan...
ANDREA different?
TOMMY He's just going through some tough times.
EVAN Mom.
EVAN Don't cry.
EVAN I can change this.
TOMMY I think I'll go check out the chapel.
ANDREA You're.
ANDREA Acting.
ANDREA Like your father.
EVAN Come on, Mom.
EVAN Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
Andrea is shocked.
ANDREA How.
ANDREA Did you.
ANDREA Know that?
EVAN You told me that on Parents' Weekend.
EVAN Remember?
EVAN Wait, that wasn't me.
EVAN Or you.
She uses her left hand to pinch off the air to her oxygen tube and forces herself to speak in a sick, GRAVELY manner.
ANDREA Just.
ANDREA Like.
ANDREA Jason.
EVAN Don't worry.
EVAN I'm gonna get you out of here.
He pushes a lever and the mechanical wheelchair rolls itself out of the room.
Andrea forces her loudest raspy scream.
ANDREA Stop him.
ANDREA Stop him.
ANDREA Stop him...
Lenny tears through old cardboard boxes in Evan's closet.
Evan watches nearby.
LENNY Are you sure you even packed it?
EVAN My mom packed for me.
EVAN I think she sent everything I ever owned.
EVAN So we'll see.
Evan watches Lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of Evan's junk on the floor.
Old report cards, books, toys and photo albums fall on the floor.
LENNY Is this it?
Evan beams when he sees Lenny holding his old journal.
AGE 7.
LENNY What do you need it for?
LENNY I don't get you lately.
EVAN Duly noted.
EVAN Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
LENNY What?
EVAN Shhh.
EVAN I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
LENNY Destroy it?
EVAN If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place.
EVAN Now shhhh.
Lenny, utterly baffled, sits back in silence and watches Evan begin reading his journal to himself for a beat.
As new sounds ECHO BACKWARD.
There's a --
Evan comes to in his childhood kitchen.
He is only seven years old.
He coughs up Lucky Charms that have "magically" appeared in his mouth.
On a journal before him is the recently written passage:
"Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayley and Tommy.
I will mete there father and see what a real dad is like."
Andrea is nowhere in sight.
Evan springs to his feet and flexes his real hands triumphantly.
EVAN Yes.
EVAN Now how do I destroy the blockbuster?
He rummages through the utensil drawer and pulls out a large butcher knife and grabs it.
He tucks it into his sock but it won't fit.
He's still debating what to do when:
ANDREA WALKS IN and is startled by the unexpected sight of Evan holding a huge knife.
Evan sees her but remains expressionless.
Andrea's face blanches.
ANDREA Evan?
ANDREA What are you doing with that knife?
Evan comes to to find Lenny still staring at him.
Waiting for something big to happen.
EVAN Well, that didn't work...
Evan flips a single page of his journal and tries again.
He reads to himself, then relaxes his head --
Evan, seven again, stands in the basement dressed in his Robin Hood costume as Mr. Miller prepares for the sex scene.
MR. MILLER Now in this part of the story, Robin Hood just married Maid Marian and they have to kiss and stuff like grown-ups do.
Kayleigh giggles.
There seems to be a new glint of intelligence in Evan's eyes as he adjusts to his new surroundings.
EVAN Wait!
EVAN I need my belt!
Mr. Miller is puzzled, but watches Evan SKIP to the fireplace.
EVAN Loo loo, skip to my loo.
EVAN Loo loo, skip to my loo.
Mr. Miller puts his eye back to the viewfinder as Evan quickly finds Mr. Miller's old army thermos in the bottom drawer of the dresser, opens it and shakes out the blockbuster.
EVAN Loo, loo, skip to my loo.
He tries to crack it with his own hands, but his seven-year old body is too weak.
MR. MILLER Hey kid, don't bother with the belt.
Mr. Miller finally turns around and sees Evan banging the blockbuster on the table.
Shock registers in Mr. Miller's eyes and he takes a step towards Evan.
EVAN Back off, fuckbag!
Mr. Miller freezes on that, and Evan smiles at him.
EVAN Amazing.
EVAN That word never fails to make an impression with you...
Mr. Miller takes a slow, non-threatening step toward Evan.
MR. MILLER Easy does it, Evan!
MR. MILLER Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
EVAN And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors.
EVAN One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Kayleigh's mouth hangs open with utter amazement at the scene.
Tommy, hiding at the top of the stairs, slowly creeps down to get a better view.
Evan rummages in the bureau and finds the wooden "strike anywhere" matches used at thirteen to light his cigarettes.
MR. MILLER That's dangerous!
MR. MILLER You could blow your hands off!
EVAN Been there, done that.
Evan, standing near the fireplace, defiantly strikes the match with this thumb and lowers the flame to the short fuse.
Mr. Miller charges Evan just as the fuse is lit!
Mr. Miller knocks the blockbuster from Evan's hand and it rolls towards the other side of the room, resting peacefully against the video camera.
Kayleigh's eyes are dazzled by the sparkling fuse and she bends down to pick it up --
MR. MILLER/TOMMY/EVAN Kayleigh!
MR. MILLER/TOMMY/EVAN NOOOOOooooo!
BOOM!
The blast is deafening.
Evan, twenty, wakes up with a bloody nose.
EVAN Oh God, Kayleigh...
Evan gets a new series of QUICK IMAGES and FLASHED FACES.
Evan (now seven) is institutionalized before a judge.
Evan (seven through twelve) GROWS UP in an institution.
Evan undergoes years of therapy under Redfield's care.
Evan lies in a room, same posters from college adorn the walls.
Blood flows freely now.
EVAN Kayleigh...
EVAN no!
EVAN You can't die again!
EVAN I won't let this happen.
EVAN I won't!
Evan fights off the pain and looks under his bed for something.
EVAN Where are they?!
His journals are missing!
He runs from the room.
Evan runs into Dr. Redfield's office just as another patient is leaving.
DR. REDFIELD Hey, Evan.
DR. REDFIELD What's the big rush?
DR. REDFIELD We don't meet for another hour.
EVAN Where are my goddamn books?
DR. REDFIELD Books?
EVAN My journals!
EVAN Where are they?
The doctor looks heartbroken, as if Evan has had a relapse.
DR. REDFIELD It kills me to have to go through this again.
DR. REDFIELD There are no journals.
DR. REDFIELD There never were.
DR. REDFIELD It's part of this fantasy world your mind created to cope with the guilt of killing...
Evan looks stunned.
Refusing to believe it.
DR. REDFIELD Think Evan.
DR. REDFIELD You've invented a disease that doesn't exist.
DR. REDFIELD Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
EVAN But I...
EVAN I need those books.
DR. REDFIELD You remind me of your father.
DR. REDFIELD He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
EVAN Photos?
Evan's eyes roll back and he collapses lifelessly to the floor.
Evan lies on a platform and gets another series of CAT-scans.
Evan, no longer incapacitated, stares out the window into the darkness.
Alone.
Trapped.
Hopeless.
Later that day, Dr. Redfield posts the new CAT-scan slides on the light box and shudders when he sees the results.
Andrea looks on anxiously.
DR. REDFIELD Jesus, no.
Andrea, biting her nails, is unable to conceal her fear.
ANDREA No dances, just tell me.
DR. REDFIELD The hemorrhaging...
DR. REDFIELD the neural damage is irreparable.
DR. REDFIELD I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
Andrea begins to break down in tears.
Evan secretly listens in from the hallway.
His gaunt face looks deep in thought.
He takes a breath and enters the lab, making sure not to look directly at his weeping mother.
EVAN Hey, Mom, didja remember to bring those goofy old home movies we used to make?
Andrea wipes tears away, nodding in advance.
Evan sees no one is watching him in the institution corridor as he throws his weight into the door of the doctor's office, breaking it open.
Sporadically, severe VIBRATIONS invade Evan's environment, threatening to distract him from his mission.
Evan enters the office and tears the file cabinets apart, looking for something.
His nose bleeds profusely and he repeatedly wipes the blood off his face with irritation.
Evan sees a cardboard marked TREBORN, E. Grabs it and hides under the doctor's desk.
FLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting for him.
An ALARM SOUNDS.
GUARDS are shouting.
Evan, under the doctor's desk, grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand.
EVAN If anyone finds this, then I guess my plan didn't work and I'm already dead.
Again, the world flutters as if it were attached to a paint- shaker.
He takes a deep breath.
EVAN But I -- I can just go back to the beginning of all this, I might be able to save her.
Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing...
Dr. Redfield catches up with the rest of the guards.
DR. REDFIELD He's not in his room.
DR. REDFIELD Search the grounds.
The cardboard box is overturned.
Evan finishes threading a SUPER-8 film projector and turns it on.
Careful not to let any light spill against the wall, Evan projects it at the underside of the desk.
We see familiar home movie footage from his childhood: Lenny, 5, has a birthday party.
Kayleigh is there.
Getting lost in the memory.
CHAOTIC NOISES of CHILDREN'S PARTY bleed into Evan's reality.
The world SHUDDERS UNCONTROLLABLY.
Evan, 5, comes to at a birthday party.
He's unexpectedly gently prodded forward by Andrea.
ANDREA Go on, Evan.
ANDREA Introduce yourself.
Evan slowly approaches Kayleigh, only five.
She smiles bashfully at him.
An old memory comes back to him.
KAYLEIGH (V.O.) When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with.
KAYLEIGH (V.O.) I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I lived with my mom, I'd never see you again...
Evan slowly looks around the yard, taking in the reality of this distant memory.
He even inhales the aroma of the place.
Savoring the moment.
He locks eyes with Kayleigh.
ANDREA He's not usually this shy.
It's time.
Evan leans over to Kayleigh as if he's about to kiss her.
Then whispers in her ear:
EVAN I hate you.
EVAN If you ever come near me again, I'll kill you and your whole family.
Kayleigh reacts predictably.
Bursting into tears and runs into Kayleigh's mother's arms.
KAYLEIGH'S MOTHER What did you say to her?
KAYLEIGH'S MOTHER What happened?!
Evan ignores them.
He can't take his eyes off Kayleigh.
EVAN Goodbye.
His eyes well up.
Evan wakes up with a bloody nose.
He grabs a pillow and covers his head with it as a flood of memories seizes him.
Lenny (looking fit) grabs a towel from atop an award-winning flatworms project and hands it to Evan.
LENNY You alright?
LENNY Should I call the doctor?
Evan groans and shakes his head "no".
He rides out the pain like a seasoned pro.
When it finally subsides, he lowers the pillow and smiles feebly.
EVAN I'll think I'll be alright this time.
EVAN I really do.
Lenny nods, still concerned.
Evan opens the door to a concrete room with a large furnace.
He and Lenny carry cardboard boxes.
LENNY You sure about this?
Evan nods.
They silently dump tons of journals into the fire.
Evan steps outside and returns with a box of home movies, photo albums, old report cards, etc.
In they go.
Burning journals.
Evan, a suit now, walks down a city street cradling a cell phone to his ear.
EVAN Yeah, Ma.
EVAN I'm running a little late for lunch.
EVAN One of my patients had a breakdown.
EVAN Anyway, order some soup in the meantime.
EVAN See ya soon.
As he clicks off, an attractive woman wearing a power suit approaches from the other direction.
Evan has to look closely, but it's Kayleigh.
A mature woman, now.
He stumbles slightly, caught off guard.
As she passes, her eyes linger on his a little longer than necessary, but there's no recognition.
Evan watches her continue past him and down the sidewalk.
After a hesitant beat, he takes a breath, turns around and follows her.
