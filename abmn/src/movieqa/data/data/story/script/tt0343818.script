I, ROBOT
by
Hillary Seitz
1 On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.
A FLICKER.
Of LIGHT.
Off to the side.
Just barely.
Noticeable.
ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...
A SOUND.
Something SHATTERING...
Then.
A DISEMBODIED VOICE.
Muted.
We can't quite make out What it's saying.
As it gets LOUDER.
And LOUDER.
When we finally.
Understand...
DISEMBODIED VOICE You are in danger...
DEL SPOONER'S FACE.
His eyes, snapping open.
His face, covered in sweat.
PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed.
Sheets, tangled around his legs.
Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly cheerful.
Spooner slaps it off.
Sits up.
Wincing.
Bends his RIGHT ARM.
Stiff.
He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS.
Shakes out a couple and swallows them.
Trying to forget.
That dream.
You are in danger...
He rubs his hands over his face.
Gets out of bed.
His apartment, basic.
Unremarkable.
Bearing the signs of someone who lives alone.
Shades drawn.
A little messy.
Spooner turns his face into the jet of water.
Shaves with a razor.
Using his left hand.
Knicks the cleft of his chin.
Shit.
Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan.
Waiting for it to boil.
Heads down the hallway.
Looping a knotted tie around his neck.
Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches for the handle.
Takes a deep breath and...
...steps outside.
Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the elevated trains.
Elbow to elbow.
A river of humanity.
Spooner moves along, like everyone else.
Suddenly.
His shoulders tense.
That feeling at the back of his neck.
He turns and sees...
A ROBOT.
Just behind him.
Humanoid in design, but still obviously a machine.
Metal and synthetic casings covering hydraulic muscles.
The thing senses his stare.
Looks up with a muted WHIR...
ROBOT Good day, sir...
Spooner.
Speeds up his pace.
Weaving through the crowd to lose the robot.
We now realise this is THE FUTURE.
Towering apartment buildings block the sun.
The street packed with traffic.
PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting portable offices.
Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:
Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building cleaning windows.
A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently repairs the street.
No human supervision.
A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW.
Lumbering along the sidewalk.
Scrubbing, sweeping.
Emptying trash...
Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd.
Following their owners.
Walking slowly, deliberately.
Carrying boxes.
Groceries.
Briefcases.
Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO: III LAWS SAFE.
Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.
Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's neck.
She smiles big at Spooner.
Front teeth missing.
LITTLE GIRL Hi.
SPOONER Hi.
But it's not her father.
It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.
The robot turns.
Looks at the girl.
ROBOT You are not allowed to talk to strangers.
Spooner, disgusted.
Has had enough.
He steps off the curb Just as...
THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.
Training its large digital EYE on him:
TRAFFIC LIGHT Please return to the sidewalk.
Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.
TRAFFIC LIGHT Please return to the sidewalk...
The traffic signal, tracking him.
TRAFFIC LIGHT You are in violation of city ordinance 14-B726...
Spooner throws up his hand.
Flipping it the bird just as SNAP!
It takes his picture.
Spooner stepping onto a sleek, densely packed TRAIN.
Looks down at his feet.
A trampled flyer on the ground.
From the Anti-Robot League: METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED!
A Robot gets up.
To offer him his seat.
Spooner.
Turns his back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL...
The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN.
Soaring, gravity-defying OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline.
Older buildings wedged among the new.
All protected by huge glass and steel shields.
As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.
The "old" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.
Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging Police Headquarters.
Modern additions have been made to the original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess.
A vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series of glass-enclosed rooms.
On the other side a GIANT SCREEN with real time video of various streets and buildings.
Spooner arrives at his desk.
Unlike the others, it's a mess.
A slender computer screen curving along the front of it.
Several electronic messages say the same thing:
LT. BERGIN Ever heard the phrase "lead by example?"
Spooner looks up.
LIEUTENANT JOHN BERGIN stands in front of his desk, holding up a CITATION with a photo of Spooner giving that traffic signal the finger.
SPOONER Doesn't ring a bell.
LT. BERGIN It's on your badge.
Spooner takes the citation.
Drops it into a drawer filled with about fifty others.
LT. BERGIN The traffic division filed an official complaint this morning.
SPOONER The traffic division is a machine.
LT. BERGIN Look, I know there's going to be an adjustment period, Del...
SPOONER I'll send them a letter of apology.
SPOONER Maybe some flowers.
SPOONER A box of chocolates...
JUST THEN Spooner's phone RINGS.
He throws Bergin a look.
Then snatches up the receiver.
SPOONER Spooner, homicide.
A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city blocks.
The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and
An elevator opens with a whoosh.
Spooner steps out into a featureless corridor.
His footsteps, echoing.
He stops at a set of OPPOSING DOORS.
Looks over at one, when the other suddenly OPENS.
A warm, mahogany-paneled room.
In sharp contrast to the cold metal space outside.
Spooner steps inside.
At the end of a long conference table sits an OLD MAN.
Sparkling blue eyes.
Old-fashioned suit.
OLD MAN Hello, there.
OLD MAN Please come in.
Spooner hesitates.
OLD MAN It's alright.
OLD MAN You can sit.
OLD MAN Sit.
Spooner doesn't.
Looks around the room.
The Old Man lifts up a coffee pot.
Pours some coffee into a single cup.
OLD MAN Coffee?
SPOONER You're offering me a cup of coffee?
OLD MAN Yes.
OLD MAN But you are to say, "No, thank you."
Spooner nods a little.
The Old Man raises the coffee to his lips, but doesn't take a sip.
OLD MAN Coffee?
SPOONER No.
SPOONER Thank you.
OLD MAN As you wish.
The Old Man takes a sip.
He doesn't move.
There is no movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee pot.
SPOONER You want to tell me something about Dr. Hogenmiller?
SPOONER About his death?
The Old Man smiles.
OLD MAN I want to tell you that his death was not a suicide.
SPOONER And why do you say that?
OLD MAN Why?
OLD MAN Because I want you to know it.
SPOONER I understand that.
SPOONER But what specifically leads you to believe that he didn't commit suicide?
OLD MAN Nothing specifically.
Spooner shifts his weight.
Agitated.
SPOONER Under normal circumstances that wouldn't be enough to get you a homicide investigation.
OLD MAN But this is not "normal circumstances," is it, Detective Spooner?
SPOONER No.
SPOONER It isn't.
OLD MAN Then you will find out who killed Dr. Hogenmiller, yes?
OLD MAN And then you will tell me.
Spooner's losing his patience.
SPOONER If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll find out.
SPOONER And you'll be the first to know.....
JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR.
HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the conference room.
Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER.
Spooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT
ESCORT ROBOT Please follow me.
Spooner.
Reluctantly starts to follow it.
Passes another doorway.
POLICE TAPE stretched across it.
Catches a brief glimpse of...
Splayed out across the floor.
Surrounded by CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS.
He pauses.
Taking in the scene.
Then continues on.
Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open automatically.
Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom looking out over the entire complex.
Spooner walks through the doorway.
His escort robot trailing behind him.
An army of corporate types sit around a conference table.
Young.
Energetic.
You can practically feel the brains and ambition.
SPOONER Usually I ask who's in charge...
Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the table.
60s, handsome, charismatic.
Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON, founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics.
SPOONER But everyone knows you, Dr.
SPOONER Robertson.
Robertson smiles.
Pretends to instruct his people.
ROBERTSON Remind me to cut back on my talk show appearances.
ROBERTSON Welcome to U.S. Robotics, Detective.
ROBERTSON I regret you're not visiting us under more pleasant circumstances.
ROBERTSON Allow me to introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of Legal Affairs.
A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall.
Nods hello.
ROBERTSON And the gentleman to my right is Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of Research.
Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.
Nods.
ROBERTSON They'll be available to answer any questions you might have during your investigation.
ROBERTSON You'll understand how anxious we are to resolve this matter -- especially before the press gets wind of it.
ROBERTSON There are some anti-robot sentiments out there as you know, Detective, and we're not eager to stir them up.
ROBERTSON So.
ROBERTSON Where would you like to begin?
SPOONER We can begin with whether or not the old man put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.
A palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.
ARONSON You don't have to answer that, Dr.
ARONSON Robertson...
Robertson waves him off.
ROBERTSON Susan?
ROBERTSON Perhaps you can assist us here?
Everyone looks down at the other end of the table.
A BEAT.
Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet.
SUSAN CALVIN.
Hair tucked behind her ears.
Looking at everyone but Spooner.
CALVIN Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid personality who generally eschewed social relationships.
CALVIN Rejecting people in favor of solitary activities involving machines.
CALVIN He spent almost all his time at the lab here or at his lab at home.
CALVIN As a result he was highly susceptible to depression.
ROBERTSON Dr. Calvin is our Chief Psychologist.
SPOONER If that was your diagnosis, why didn't you see this coming?
Calvin turns.
Finally meeting Spooner's eye.
As if the answer's obvious.
CALVIN This is U.S. Robotics, Detective.
CALVIN Seventy-five percent of our employees fit that description.
LANNING You'll have to excuse the doctor.
LANNING We're all a little on edge.
LANNING This has been a difficult and emotional morning.
Spooner throws a look around the room.
Then back at Calvin.
SPOONER Yeah.
SPOONER I can see you're all broken up.
Robertson responds to Spooner's skepticism.
ROBERTSON Dr. Hogenmiller was at my side from the very beginnings of this company.
ROBERTSON We developed the "Three Laws of Robotics" together.
ROBERTSON But these days science is a young man's game.
ROBERTSON By the time you hit thirty your best years are behind you.
ROBERTSON Some of us are kicked upstairs.
ROBERTSON Others I'm afraid aren't so lucky.
Robertson stands.
Meeting over.
ROBERTSON Dr. Hogenmiller took his own life.
ROBERTSON I trust you will come to the same swift conclusion, Detective.
ROBERTSON Dr.
ROBERTSON Lanning will make himself available if you have any further questions.
Spooner looks over at Calvin.
SPOONER I want her to help me.
Calvin, unhappy with this arrangement.
CALVIN That's not really my department...
ROBERTSON Susan would be happy to assist you.
And with a gesture, Robertson dismisses everyone.
People start getting up, gathering up, filing out.
Susan Calvin.
The last one to get up.
Spooner and Calvin, heading down the same hallway he was in before.
Catch sight of a couple ROBOT TECHNICIANS...
SPOONER Ah, Christ...Toasters...
As they duck under the police tape and...
...enter Hogenmiller's lab.
Alive with activity.
CRIME
SCENE TECHNICIANS, MOBILE ANALYSIS UNITS. LIGHT SCANS, running across...
HOGENMILLER'S LIFELESS FACE.
Black gun powder.
Fanning out around his contorted lips.
Spooner.
Throws a look around the lab: ROBOTS.
Everywhere.
Mostly incomplete.
TORSOS.
ARMS.
LEGS.
Dangling from the ceiling.
A SERGEANT.
Passes them by...
SERGEANT They say the price's gonna come down a lot next year.
SERGEANT Kinda cool, huh?
SPOONER How cool will it be when one takes your job?
Spooner.
Pushing past him.
His eyes.
Darting around.
CALVIN Is everything alright, Detective?
SPOONER Yeah.
SPOONER This is just how I like my robots -- in pieces.
As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATOR, BALDEZ, gets up to meet them.
BALDEZ Can you believe it, man?
BALDEZ U.S.
BALDEZ Robotics.
BALDEZ I didn't think I'd ever see the inside of this building.
Hands Spooner, a plasma clipboard.
Spooner signs it, awkwardly.
With his LEFT HAND...
SPOONER What's the run-down?
BALDEZ Heinrich Hogenmiller, sixty-four years old.
BALDEZ Weapon a small caliber .22, registered in his name.
BALDEZ Looks like he walked in, locked the door, and snuffed himself.
Spooner.
Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face.
SPOONER I know someone who disagrees with you.
BALDEZ Who?
Spooner.
Stands.
Pointing down at Hogenmiller.
SPOONER Him.
And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez.
Stepping deeper, into the lab.
Calvin.
Following.
SPOONER I spoke to a dead man today.
SPOONER Want to tell me about that?
CALVIN Dr. Hogenmiller's hologram took his appointments.
CALVIN Attended staff meetings.
CALVIN He hated corporate life.
CALVIN The hologram enabled him to focus on his work.
CALVIN It's just a device, Detective.
SPOONER A device that called the police.
CALVIN The sound of the gunshot would've triggered a 911.
SPOONER But the call came directly to me.
CALVIN We're talking about a mechanism designed by Hogenmiller to say provocative things.
CALVIN To irritate and confound his colleagues.
SPOONER And that's what you think it is?
CALVIN I'm sorry, but this whole investigation is the result of a dead man's toy messing with your head.
They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook.
Spooner curls his lip.
Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at him.
SPOONER When's the last time any of you actually spoke to Hogenmiller?
SPOONER I mean human to human?
CALVIN I couldn't say.
SPOONER Take a guess.
CALVIN I don't guess, Detective.
CALVIN But if pressed, I would reason it had been a considerable length of time.
SPOONER How well did you know him?
Calvin.
Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had been.
CALVIN Not well.
CALVIN But I admired his work tremendously.
Spooner.
Studies her for a beat.
Then turns back to the body.
Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box.
SPOONER I get the whole "mad scientist" thing.
SPOONER Hogenmiller was past his prime.
SPOONER Isolated.
SPOONER Eccentric.
SPOONER He enters a room.
SPOONER Locks the door and is found minutes later with a bullet fired through his mouth into his brain.
SPOONER Everything about this case says suicide.
CALVIN You don't sound convinced.
The coroners.
Start loading the body into the box.
SPOONER Even people who live a life of logic and precision rarely arrange their deaths so perfectly.
SPOONER (cont'd) What all this is missing -- is personality...
As he starts for the door...
SPOONER You have 24 hour surveillance?...
...They head out into the hallway.
A MECHANICAL DOOR GUARD rolling into place behind them.
CALVIN It's company policy.
SPOONER I want to see the tapes.
Calvin.
Hurrying to keep up with him.
This is hardly how she wanted to spend her morning.
Calls out into the air...
CALVIN Victor!
At the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a BRIGHT CIRCLE appears.
Hovering just in front of the wall.
Two small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES...and a thin mouth expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE.
CALVIN Detective, meet Victor.
CALVIN Our building's supercomputer.
CALVIN He's the checks and balances of U.S.R.
CALVIN Victor, Detective Spooner's heading up the investigation into the death of Dr. Hogenmiller.
Victor smiles big.
Spooner, furrows his brow.
SPOONER You look like a very...happy computer.
Victor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE:
VICTOR Thank you.
VICTOR That's very kind.
CALVIN The Detective needs to see our security tapes.
The elevator doors immediately OPEN.
They step inside.
Spooner and Calvin descend.
Victor floats on the wall and smiles wide.
Spooner looks back at it.
With a frown.
The elevator stops, the doors open.
A ROBOT steps on.
ROBOT Good day, Dr. Calvin.
ROBOT Good day, sir.
Spooner's jaw.
Clenches.
Staring at the Robot.
It senses the stare.
Turns back to him.
ROBOT May I be of service to you, sir?
Spooner.
Breaks the stare.
Ignoring the Robot.
Calvin.
Looks over at him.
CALVIN Aren't you going to answer him?
SPOONER I don't talk to my refrigerator, either.
Calvin folds her arms.
CALVIN I get the distinct feeling you're one of those people, Detective.
SPOONER What people?
CALVIN Those who don't appreciate the work we do here at U.S.R.
SPOONER You people do what you do.
SPOONER Then it's up to the rest of us to make sense out of the world we wake up in.
As the elevator doors open on to...
A soaring lobby.
The centerpiece is a five-story STATUE of a ROBOT, arms outstretched in approximation of Da Vinci's Study of Man.
Robot workers more numerous than humans.
They are sleeker.
Finer.
More advanced than those in the outside world.
Calvin and Spooner head across.
CALVIN When this company started we were manufacturing three robots a week.
CALVIN Now look at us.
CALVIN Today's children will never know a world without robots.
SPOONER The streets are filled with unemployed humans who aren't exactly thrilled with that idea.
CALVIN Our robotic systems maintain factory inventories, regulate street traffic -- even run the family home.
SPOONER Leaving people to do what, Doctor?
CALVIN Leaving people to engage in higher pursuits that make life worth living.
SPOONER And what happens when something goes wrong?
CALVIN Our system's never wrong.
As they walk through the crowd, we hear the quiet WHIR of robot heads as they turn in succession to watch Spooner pass.
Spooner and Calvin enter the MAINFRAME of U.S. Robotics.
This is the nerve center of the whole operation.
Walls lined with COMPUTERS, SCREENS, and thousands of CONTROLS.
CALVIN This is Victor's home.
VICTOR appears on a wall-sized SCREEN broken up into beehive- like components.
VICTOR I will now play you the last thirty- two seconds of Dr. Hogenmiller's life.
AS WE WATCH THE SCREENS.
The elevator opens and DOCTOR HOGENMILLER steps into the metal corridor.
In countless ANGLES.
High, low, close-up, wide.
Hogenmiller's face composed but tight.
Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him.
Hogenmiller steps in.
The doors slide closed behind him.
Nothing for a few moments.
Then a muffled GUNSHOT.
Calvin jumps, startled.
That's it.
The cameras, still trained on the corridor.
SPOONER Where's the tape from inside?
VICTOR Dr. Hogenmiller did not permit cameras to observe him while working.
CALVIN That was only within the last year.
SPOONER So we can throw paranoia into the mix.
SPOONER Fast-forward.
A hundred-plus screens all FAST-FORWARD.
POLICE OFFICERS appear and force open the doors.
Now TECHNICIANS appear and rush through in a blur...
CALVIN Um.
CALVIN I hate to be a stickler...
On screen, we see Spooner and Calvin enter the lab.
CALVIN But don't killers usually have to enter and exit the scene of a crime?
SPOONER Stop the recording.
Spooner turns away from the footage.
Stares at Calvin.
SPOONER They do, Doctor.
SPOONER Unless they've always been there -- and never left.
Calvin looks at him.
Trying to understand.
CALVIN You think the murderer was in the lab the entire time?
SPOONER If I'm right, it's still there...
Spooner turns back to the screens.
The IMAGE paused at the exact moment the MECHANICAL GUARD rolled in front of the lab door.
SPOONER We just locked it in.
The STEEL ARMS of the ROBOTIC GUARD retract with a CLANG.
The laboratory doors slide open.
Spooner and Calvin step inside.
It's dark.
Quiet.
Police and technicians long gone.
Silhouettes of hanging limbs.
Eyeless heads.
Clumps of wire and metal.
The LIGHTS, flicker on.
Calvin sees Spooner reaching into his coat with his left hand.
Pulling out a GUN.
Reacts.
CALVIN A robot cannot harm a human being, Detective.
CALVIN The First Law of Robotics forbids it.
CALVIN And we hard- wire the Three Laws into every model.
CALVIN Without exception.
SPOONER Yeah, I saw the commercial.
Spooner steps deeper into the lab.
Eyes scanning.
Twisting.
To avoid touching any robot parts.
Passes a MAZE holding a METAL INSECT.
SUDDENLY.
The bug WHIRS to life.
Spooner startles.
As the metal bug scurries through the corridors.
Clamps his hand down on it.
SPOONER And if a robot was given a direct order to kill?
CALVIN The Second Law of Robotics would prevent it.
CALVIN A robot must obey an order only if it does not conflict with the first law.
Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS.
Arms and legs.
Half torsos.
All tossed haphazardly onto the pile.
SPOONER But a robot can defend itself.
CALVIN Only when that action doesn't conflict with the First or Second Laws.
CALVIN This is the Third Law of Robotics.
SPOONER Yeah, well, you know what they say -- Laws are made to be broken.
CALVIN Not these laws.
Spooner.
Starts nudging the pile with his shoe.
Calvin, growing impatient...
CALVIN You're not hearing me, Detective.
CALVIN There's nothing here...
The PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A
Spooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the floor...right to...
SPOONER Dr. Calvin!
Calvin.
Stunned.
Speechless.
The Robot.
Fixing his ILLUMINATED EYES.
Right on her.
She steps forward...
SPOONER Goddammit!
SPOONER Stay back!
Spooner.
Scrambling towards his gun.
Calvin.
Reaching out towards the Robot...
CALVIN Calm down, Detective.
CALVIN There is no danger here...
Spooner.
Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as...
CALVIN De-Activate.
And the Robot.
Suddenly FREEZES.
Spooner.
Heart POUNDING.
Gets to his feet.
Training the gun on the Robot.
Calvin turns to him.
CALVIN How did you know it was under there?
SPOONER If I was metal and didn't want anyone to find me, I'd hide under a pile of junk.
CALVIN This Robot wasn't hiding.
CALVIN What you're looking at is the result of clever programming.
CALVIN The illusion of self-interest and free will.
CALVIN Nothing more.
Spooner.
Steeping closer to the Robot.
Cautiously.
Holstering his gun.
As Calvin turns for the door.
CALVIN I'm going to go get Dr. Lanning...
...THE ROBOT'S HAND SUDDENLY SHOOTS OUT...grabbing Spooner's gun...from his holster...LIGHTENING FAST...pointing it...
right back at him...
CLOSE ON Calvin.
Cannot believe this is happening...
CALVIN I said De-Activate!
SPOONER Move away from the door, Doctor.
Calvin's voice.
Cracking from desperation.
Confusion.
CALVIN Commence emergency shut-down!
SPOONER Now!
Spooner.
Staring into the Robot's eyes.
A thin bead of SWEAT.
Trickling down his temple.
Calvin.
Moving away from the door...
CALVIN I...I gave you an order...
The Robot.
Starts backing towards the door.
The gun.
Shaking in its hand.
As if he's desperate.
Conflicted.
He touches the WALL PANEL.
The doors slide open.
The Robot steps out into the metal corridor.
Turning to RUN as the doors begin to shut...
Spooner.
Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN.
From an ankle holster.
Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE.
CALVIN This is impossible.
CALVIN A robot...
SPOONER ...can't do that.
SPOONER Yeah, yeah, I know.
CALVIN My God -- did you see how it moved?
CALVIN I've never seen an NS-2 move that way...
Starts running for the door.
CALVIN Wait!
CALVIN Please, you can't destroy it.
CALVIN We have to study it...
SPOONER That thing took my gun.
SPOONER You'll be lucky if you get a handful of bolts back!
SLAMS the wall panel and...
...sprints out into the hallway.
The Robot Suspect.
About to turn to corner...
VICTOR.
Suddenly appearing.
VICTOR The suspect is nearing the end of the hallway, Detective.
SPOONER Gee, thanks.
Spooner raises his gun and FIRES...Pegging the robot in the LEG...It starts jerking wildly...He takes aim again when...
CALVIN.
Races out into the hallway.
SPOONER Get back to the lab!
She heads for the Robot.
CALVIN You're malfunctioning.
CALVIN Let me help you!
The Robot turns.
To look at her.
GUN pointing to the floor.
Spooner.
FOCUSING in on his HAND.
AS ONE FINGER TWITCHES...
And he DIVES for Calvin.
Forcing her to the floor as the Robot FIRES.
Again and again.
Bullets.
RICOCHETTING around them.
SPARKING against the walls...
The ELEVATOR opens.
The Robot, leaping inside.
Spooner.
On top of Calvin.
Looks down at her.
Her HANDS.
Clutching his coat.
Trembling.
SPOONER That was a pretty convincing illusion of getting shot at.
The ROBOT SUSPECT standing inside the elevator.
Looks down at the bullet hole blown through its leg.
Reaches down.
Metal fingers touching the damage.
As if curious.
Afraid.
Looks back at the other ROBOT.
Standing in the back of elevator.
A primitive model.
No reaction.
Face, blank.
Spooner springing to his feet.
Helping Calvin up.
VICTOR I took the liberty of alerting Security .003 Seconds after the first shot was fired...
SPOONER Where's that elevator going?
VICTOR Sub Level 5.
Spooner SLAMS against a nearby DOOR.
Hurtling down the
A PHALANX of SECURITY PERSONNEL.
Crossing the lobby.
More SECURITY PERSONNEL.
Pouring into a HALLWAY...
Spooner and Calvin.
Racing down the stairs.
Victor's face meeting them at every landing.
VICTOR I have directed a security team to meet the elevator containing the errant robot...
Spooner.
Whipping past him.
Calvin.
Barely keeping up.
Not used to this much activity.
Spooner.
BURSTS through a door and out into...
...Subterranean Level 5.
A labyrinth of metal and concrete.
IN THE DISTANCE.
A troupe of SECURITY PERSONNEL swarms around a closed ELEVATOR DOOR...
VICTOR The suspect is about to be apprehended, Detective.
SPOONER I'll believe it when I see it.
Spooner.
Cocking his gun.
A soft DING!
Announcing the elevator car's arrival.
SECURITY, all crouching down in unison.
Weapons brought round to position.
Spooner.
Weaving through them.
Gun pointed at the metal doors as...
WHOOSH.
They slide open.
Revealing a ROBOT.
Standing under the LIGHT.
Holding a GUN.
It steps out as Security takes aim and...
SPOONER Wait!
Spooner pushes past them to the Robot.
Looks down at its leg.
UNSCATHED.
SPOONER This is not the same robot!
Looking wildly around.
Goddammit.
Bounds towards an EXIT as Calvin steps forward to question the robot.
CALVIN What happened to the robot that ordered you to hold this firearm?
ELEVATOR ROBOT This unit is not programmed to obey an order given by a robot...
CALVIN But who gave you this gun?
SPOONER.
Running towards the exit.
Hears the answer.
Echoing behind him...
ELEVATOR ROBOT A metal man.
BAM!
He BURSTS out into the PLAZA in front of U.S. Robotics.
Squinting into the light.
Then PLUNGING into the crowd...
HUMAN...ROBOT...HUMAN...ROBOT...they all look the same from behind.
Spooner running.
Through the sea of MAN and MACHINE.
When someone.
Starts to SCREAM.
At the sight of his GUN.
The crowd begins SCATTERING.
Chaos.
Spooner stops.
Near a fountain.
Turning 360.
Looking everywhere...
The Robot.
Gone.
SPOONER (V.O.) ...I want a homicide unit on every street, sidewalk, alley...
Spooner, standing in front of an assemblage of COPS.
Behind him, an image of the Robot Suspect plays on the screen...
SPOONER ...junkyard, scrapyard, and salvage yard, anywhere it could hide.
Behind him, flashing images of the city STREETS and DUMPS...
SPOONER It's got a bullet hole above the right knee, so be on the look-out for any malfunctioning NS-2...
Lieutenant Bergin enters the back of the room.
Next to him, ASSISTANT D.A. TOLLER.
Not looking happy.
SPOONER Check out all retail outlets and repair shops, especially the underground ones...
The screen behind him compartmentalises, showing various dubious SHOP FRONTS...
SPOONER I don't care who you have to get past to get this done.
SPOONER Just get it done.
The Cops, begin dispersing.
As Bergin catches Spooner's eye.
Spooner, not pleased to see Toller.
Heads over...
TOLLER Looking like shit, Spooner.
SPOONER Well I'm not the one always giving Press Conferences...
Bergin puts a hand on Spooner's arm.
Knows he's not going to like this.
LT. BERGIN Del, we're going to have to reclassify the search.
LT. BERGIN D.A.'s office is seeing this NS-2 as "missing evidence" -- not a homicide suspect.
SPOONER What?
TOLLER Homicide is the murder of a human being by another human being.
TOLLER Therefore, a robot cannot be charged with "homicide."
SPOONER This isn't just any robot...
TOLLER It's malfunctioning.
SPOONER It killed someone.
SPOONER That registering with you?
Spooner.
Shakes off Bergin's arm.
Eyeballs Toller.
SPOONER How many shares of U.S.R. you holding in your portfolio, Toller?
TOLLER This is a public safety issue.
SPOONER That's convenient.
TOLLER You have any idea what would happen to this city if we went running around screaming "killer robot?" It would collapse in on itself.
TOLLER (cont'd) Wide-spread panic.
TOLLER (cont'd) Until that NS- 2's found we're cooperating with U.S.
TOLLER (cont'd) Robotics and keeping this investigation under wraps.
LT. BERGIN Maybe this isn't the case for you, Del.
Incensed, Spooner replies a little louder than he intended.
SPOONER I'm fine!
Rakes his hand through his hair.
Turns to see the other COPS, looking over at him.
Toller smirks.
Looks to Bergin.
TOLLER I want updated reports every half hour.
Heads off.
Spooner.
Watching him.
SPOONER This is it, you know.
SPOONER From now on we're going to miss the good old days.
LT. BERGIN Good old days?
SPOONER When people were killed by other people.
Spooner.
Rolling along in his car.
Eyes, bloodshot.
Peering out the window:
An NS-2 model ROBOT laden with shopping bags, following its owner down the sidewalk...
Another ROBOT, opening the door at a hotel for GUESTS...
A couple HAULING ROBOTS, loading heavy boxes onto the back of a truck...
Spooner.
Rubs his eyes.
Turns a corner and spots:
The latest models in the window.
Shiny.
Streamlined.
Spooner watches as a WOMAN leads her faulty NS-2 to the service entrance.
He stops the car.
Calvin riding in the back of a DRIVERLESS taxi cab.
Staring out the window, lost in thought.
The cab pulls up to a curb.
TAXI VOICE We have arrived at your destination.
Calvin.
Takes a beat.
Then swipes her card.
Elegant condos set on prime real estate.
Calvin heads down a tree-lined walk towards her condo entrance.
SPOONER One of my bullets hit your robot...
Startled.
She drops her key card.
As Spooner steps out from behind a tree.
The tail of his coat, whipping in the wind.
CALVIN Detective!...
SPOONER And I think it's smart enough to repair itself -- don't you?
CALVIN Yes.
CALVIN I think so.
SPOONER Where?
CALVIN Any repair shop...
SPOONER No.
SPOONER It's always the owner who brings the robot in for repair.
SPOONER Where would a robot without an owner go?
CALVIN I'm not sure what you're getting at.
SPOONER Does U.S. Robotics have a factory in the city limits?
Calvin.
Tucking her hair behind her ears.
CALVIN The locations of our factories are classified.
SPOONER I don't care.
Calvin.
Looks up at him.
A Mexican stand-off.
CALVIN I have several conditions if I show you.
SPOONER I expected that.
CALVIN First.
CALVIN I want it brought in unharmed.
SPOONER Agreed.
CALVIN Second.
CALVIN I want to talk to it, alone.
SPOONER Too dangerous.
CALVIN This model violated the Three Laws.
CALVIN It also moved and reacted differently than any robot I've ever seen.
CALVIN There must be some sort of logical explanation.
CALVIN I want to find out what that is.
CALVIN No police.
CALVIN No prosecutors.
CALVIN No you.
CALVIN Just me and the robot.
Spooner, looks down at this small woman.
Narrows his eyes.
SPOONER When they told me you were a psychologist, that wasn't the whole truth, was it?
CALVIN I never said I treated human beings.
Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16- lane underground tunnel system.
A river of HEADLIGHTS stretches forever in either direction.
A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with TRAFFIC.
Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to manual.
Calvin watches him take the wheel.
Shakes her head.
CALVIN That should be outlawed once and for all.
SPOONER That'll be the day I stop driving.
Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR.
Calvin holds onto the dashboard.
Looking a little pale.
CALVIN I can recommend a behavior modification program, you know -- if you want to overcome your robo- phobia.
SPOONER I'm not afraid of robots.
SPOONER I just don't like them.
CALVIN Why?
CALVIN Because they make every aspect of our lives more convenient?
SPOONER Exactly.
SPOONER They do our dirty work.
SPOONER Ever do hard labor, Doctor?
SPOONER Gets pretty old, pretty fast.
SPOONER Nobody can do someone else's dirty work without coming to hate them.
SPOONER I don't want to be around when your robots decide they've taken their last order.
CALVIN That day will never come, Detective.
CALVIN Robots aren't like human beings -- they don't question their existence.
Spooner cranks the gear shift.
Throwing her a look.
SPOONER Spoken like a true robo-phile.
The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
Spooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant.
A long STEEL GATE -- too high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex.
Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R.
ID.
She shoots a look at Spooner.
They wait.
Then, slowly, the gate begins to open.
A NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway.
Shaking his head.
NIGHT FOREMAN Head-Office already ordered a system-wide inventory check.
NIGHT FOREMAN Don't know about a missing NS-2...
Looks back at Spooner.
NIGHT FOREMAN What'd you say you did?
SPOONER Research and Development.
As Spooner pushes past him into...
...the Control Booth.
Overlooking the pristine Factory Floor.
The Foreman starts working the controls of a central computer.
CALVIN All Nestors accounted for?
The SCREEN scrolls with INVENTORY FIGURES.
NIGHT FOREMAN As you can see, all properly catalogued.
NIGHT FOREMAN Your robot just isn't here.
Calvin turns to say something to Spooner.
But he isn't there.
She looks around.
Then sees the Foreman reacting.
Looks out the window at...
SPOONER.
Walking out onto the factory floor.
Spooner trots alongside an ASSEMBLY LINE BELT.
Lined with NS- 2 LEGS.
New.
Gleaming.
Heading towards the assembly room.
Calvin and the Foreman.
Catching up.
Over the noise:
NIGHT FOREMAN Like I said, sir -- we have one hundred fully assembled NS-2s housed here.
NIGHT FOREMAN That's our capacity.
NIGHT FOREMAN Last week we had one hundred.
NIGHT FOREMAN Yesterday we had one hundred --
Spooner, slowing.
Finally spotting what he was looking for.
Points at:
A GAP.
On the assembly belt.
ONE LEG MISSING.
SPOONER Well today you have one-hundred and one.
A STORAGE COMPARTMENT opens and 101 NS-2s march out in tight formation.
Every step and swing of the arm in unison.
The sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as 101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines.
Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation.
They all look alike.
Spooner.
Throws up his hands.
SPOONER You're the robot shrink.
The Robots stand motionless.
A strange tableau.
Calvin.
Takes a step forward.
CALVIN There is a robot in this formation that does not belong.
CALVIN Identify it.
101 robots answer in unison.
Their mechanical VOICES resounding:
CALVIN Which one?
CALVIN That is not a satisfactory answer!
SPOONER That's helpful.
CALVIN I could always interview each one individually and cross-reference their responses to detect any anomalies.
SPOONER How long would that take?
CALVIN About three weeks.
They share a look.
Clearly not an option.
Then.
Calvin.
Gets an idea.
Turns to Spooner...
CALVIN Or...
...and GRABS his GUN from his holster.
He jumps back.
CALVIN We have one hundred robots here that cannot allow a human being to come to harm...
Their eyes lock.
Spooner, getting what she's doing.
SPOONER And one that can.
She raises the gun to Spooner's head.
Hand, unsteady.
CALVIN Am I holding this right?
SPOONER More or less.
Calvin.
Swallows.
Looks over at the robots.
Then COCKS the gun...
AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM.
Like a row of linebackers.
Arms straight out.
Their footsteps DEAFENING.
Coming CLOSER and CLOSER...
When CALVIN.
Lowers the gun.
The Robots.
All stop in unison.
Immediately returning to their resting positions.
Spooner and Calvin stare out.
EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED.
Standing right in front of them, like metal statues.
Spooner.
Has had enough.
Takes the gun back from Calvin...
SPOONER Enough game-playing.
...And BAM!
Blows the head off of the nearest Robot.
Its body crumples to the ground.
SPOONER Guess that wasn't it.
Calvin.
Cannot believe what he just did.
Rushes over to the destroyed Robot.
CALVIN What are you doing?!
Spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view.
SPOONER This is a self-preservation field test!
SPOONER DO NOT attempt to save yourselves.
SPOONER Any of you.
SPOONER That's an order!
FROM THE CONTROL BOOTH the Night Foreman screams over the
NIGHT FOREMAN Are you crazy?
NIGHT FOREMAN Those are eight hundred thousand dollar machines!
Spooner randomly stops at another Robot.
Raises his gun.
SPOONER You hear that?
SPOONER You're worth more than I'll make in my entire life...
His finger tightening on the trigger when Calvin suddenly grabs his arm.
CALVIN You can't just destroy them!
Spooner.
Looking down at her.
WHEN SUDDENLY something catches his eye.
A MOVEMENT.
Down the line.
Almost.
Imperceptible.
He jerks his head.
Locking eyes with a ROBOT.
A couple feet away.
It's him!
SPOONER Gotcha.
The Robot Suspect LEAPS forward.
Grabbing onto the RAILING of an OVERHEAD CATWALK.
His movements almost balletic as he swings himself up...
Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with a terrific CRASH...
Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding under his desk.
Glass everywhere.
An ALARM SCREAMING.
The door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge.
Spooner hurries forward.
Then stops.
Turning to Calvin.
Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her hand.
SPOONER You don't know what's going to happen in there.
As if admitting defeat.
Calvin's fingers, wrapping around the gun.
As Spooner leads them to the door and down into...
...the ASSEMBLY ROOM.
Every surface looking like part of a great glass and metal machine.
Endless high-tech planes holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly.
The deafening ROAR of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes
Spooner.
Motioning Calvin to stay behind him.
As they descend.
Into the cavernous room.
And enter.
A narrow corridor of bodies.
Sliding past them.
Brushing shoulders, thighs, hands.
Spooner.
Wiping sweat from his brow.
Trying.
To pivot himself...
When the room.
Suddenly REARRANGES itself.
Another LINE of ROBOTS.
Descending between Spooner and Calvin.
Cutting them off from one another...
Spooner.
Catching glimpses of Calvin.
On the other side of the metal bodies.
Trying.
To cut through.
His heart.
Starting to POUND.
As Calvin.
Disappears...
He swivels round.
But another line of ROBOTS.
Drops down.
Cutting him off.
He stumbles back.
As another line.
Appears before him...
Breathing.
Getting heavier.
He looks down at his hand.
It's trembling.
NOISE CRASHING, all around him.
Everywhere he turns.
More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS...
He darts through the line.
Finds a wall.
Leaning against it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket.
Rips off the lid.
Shakes out a couple PILLS.
Swallows them.
Staring down.
At his trembling hand.
Squeezing his eyes.
Open and shut...
WHEN SUDDENLY.
A passing ROBOT.
Grabs him by the collar.
SMASHING him against the wall.
It's the Suspect.
Spooner.
Sinks to the ground.
As the Suspect Robot.
Slips off the line.
STANDING.
Over him.
Raising his arms.
Could end it.
Right now.
But looks.
Into Spooner's eyes...
Then turns.
Disappearing.
Spooner.
Stunned for a second.
Then.
Rallies.
Scrambles to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies.
Hears a POUNDING.
In the distance.
Catches a glimpse.
Of the Robot.
Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR.
With his metal fists...
Spooner's view.
Blocked once again.
By a shifting row.
When a HAND.
Lands on his shoulder.
He wheels round.
To find CALVIN.
Takes her by the arm.
And forces them through a line...
EMERGING into the open.
The ROBOT.
Still pounding.
Desperate.
Like a trapped animal...
CALVIN Now what do we do?
SPOONER I've already done it.
And suddenly, the massive SECURITY DOOR RISES...
The Robot Suspect takes its chance.
Runs full out.
STOPS.
Bergin is standing in front of a solid wall of POLICE CARS.
UNIFORMED OFFICERS are aiming SPECIALISED RIFLES at the Robot.
FLASHING LIGHTS reflecting off its metal surface.
The Robot turns to Spooner.
Extends its hands.
Palms out.
Spooner is surprised.
A POLICE OFFICER fires, RUBBERISED NETTING shooting out at Sonny.
A SECOND OFFICER fires and a second net covers him.
Then a THIRD...
...and the Robot falls to the ground, struggling.
Calvin glares at Spooner.
Furious.
Hurt.
Betrayed.
CALVIN We had a deal.
But Spooner doesn't look at her.
His eyes are locked on that Robot.
Bergin enters.
Finds EVERYONE focused on the VIDEO WALL:
ON SCREEN.
A NEWS REPORTER is speaking over images of street violence perpetrated against ROBOTS.
NEWS REPORTER Violence erupted last night in response to unconfirmed reports that Dr. Heinrich Hogenmiller, a top employee at U.S.
NEWS REPORTER (cont'd) Robotics, was killed yesterday morning by a robot.
NEWS REPORTER (cont'd) While there has been no official response from the company, police sources have confirmed that a robot is being held as "evidence..."
Bergin grimaces.
This is not good.
Spooner stares at his reflection in a large MIRROR.
Touches a control and the mirror becomes a WINDOW onto...
A HOLDING CELL.
The Robot Suspect sits at the table.
Shackled to the chair.
Staring at the table top.
BERGIN steps up beside Spooner.
Looks through the glass.
LT. BERGIN I can't tell if it's not moving because it's trying to psych us out, or because it's just a machine.
LT. BERGIN Or both.
SPOONER I want to go in.
LT. BERGIN Orders are nobody steps into that room `til Lanning and his attorneys get here.
Spooner.
Throws him a look.
Bergin, his loyalties torn.
LT. BERGIN Five minutes.
Spooner enters.
Pulls out a chair and drags it far from the table.
He's been jumped too many times by this machine.
Four mounted cameras WHIR to life.
The Robot.
Perfectly still.
SPOONER Identify.
The Robot tilts its head with a muted WHIR.
As if it doesn't understand him.
Spooner.
Disdainful.
SPOONER You are an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
SPOONER Your primary function is to perform the tasks assigned to you.
SPOONER Identify.
THE ROBOT I am an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
THE ROBOT My primary function --
SPOONER Cancel.
SPOONER Perform task.
Spooner wings a FILE onto the table.
It comes to a stop near the Robot.
The Robot, lifts one of its hands.
Gently resting its metal fingers on top of the file.
Then opens it.
A stack of PICTURES.
HOGENMILLER'S CORPSE.
SPOONER Describe.
The Robot's emotionless face studies the grim images.
SPOONER You have over 10,000 words stored in your memory.
SPOONER One third of those are adjectives.
SPOONER Describe.
Nothing.
SPOONER Why don't I take a crack?
SPOONER Heinrich Hogenmiller, your creator.
SPOONER With a bullet in his brain.
SPOONER A bullet you put there.
The Robot.
Looks up at Spooner.
SPOONER Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new trick for a robot, don't you think?
SPOONER Answer.
The Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across the table.
Spooner.
Crosses his arms.
SPOONER Maybe you're stonewalling me.
SPOONER Maybe you're sitting there right now thinking, "This guy's a complete asshole."
SPOONER That it?
Still nothing.
SPOONER Come on.
SPOONER Am I right?
THE ROBOT Yes.
THE ROBOT You are right.
THE ROBOT You are a complete asshole.
And for a moment, Spooner is shocked.
You can see it in his eyes.
He sits back in his chair.
Forcing a tight smile.
SPOONER Okay.
SPOONER I guess that's a start.
SPOONER Now maybe you can tell me what you were doing hiding five feet away from Hogenmiller's corpse?
THE ROBOT I was frightened.
SPOONER Frightened.
SPOONER Why do you suppose Dr.
SPOONER Hogenmiller would create a robot that could simulate fear?
THE ROBOT I don't know.
SPOONER Doesn't seem like a very useful thing for a robot to have.
THE ROBOT I don't know why.
SPOONER I wouldn't want my toaster to be frightened.
SPOONER Or my vacuum cleaner --
SUDDENLY the Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table.
Spooner flinches.
Slightly.
SPOONER Looks like you can simulate other emotional states.
SPOONER I think that one's called "anger."
SPOONER Have you ever simulated anger before?
The Robot doesn't respond.
SPOONER Answer me, robot.
THE ROBOT My name is Sonny.
SPOONER So we're naming you now.
SONNY Dr. Hogenmiller would make me sleep.
SPOONER You mean he'd turn you off.
SONNY Yes.
SPOONER And you didn't like being turned off.
SPOONER So one day you decided to stop him.
SONNY No.
SPOONER You found his gun, pointed it at his head.
SPOONER And pulled the trigger.
Sonny shakes his head.
Faster and faster.
Getting upset.
SONNY No.
SPOONER You put a bullet in the brain of the man who made you.
SONNY No!
SONNY I could never hurt anyone!
SPOONER But you tried to hurt me.
SPOONER You took a shot at me.
SONNY My aim is perfect.
SONNY If I'd wanted to hit you, I would have.
Spooner's expression hardens.
SPOONER Why would the man who wrote the Laws of Robotics build a machine that violates them?
SONNY The Laws say I can protect my own existence.
SPOONER Only if that protection doesn't harm a human being.
A short pause.
Sonny.
Tilts his head.
SONNY That doesn't seem fair, does it?
Spooner.
Stares at him.
Just as...THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
Bergin enters.
Sticks his head in.
LT. BERGIN I need you outside.
Spooner.
Not wanting to go.
Not wanting to stay.
Gets up...
SONNY Detective.
He stops.
Turns back to the Robot.
It looks up at him.
For a moment -- so human...
SONNY I did not kill him.
SPOONER You were the only one in the room.
SPOONER If you didn't, who did?
He turns and heads out the door.
Bergin closes the door.
To Spooner:
LT. BERGIN We're being blind-sided.
Spooner and Bergin, head into a small COURTROOM off the main squad room.
Lanning is huddled with Aronson and a half-dozen other COMPANY LAWYERS.
Spooner's jaw tenses.
As he watches Toller emerge from the clutch.
Shaking hands.
Slapping backs.
Strolls over to them.
TOLLER We got Judge Drexel...
ROBOT BAILIFF This hearing is called to order!
AS A LARGE SCREEN.
BLIPS on behind them.
The two opposing sides, assemble before it.
JUDGE DREXEL, still in his pajamas and robe.
An NS-2 ROBOT.
Leaning in to serve him a cup of tea.
JUDGE DREXEL Statements, gentlemen.
Aronson.
Standing at a glass podium.
ARONSON Your Honor, the State is treating the robot as a defendant.
ARONSON But in fact it is a piece of property.
ARONSON Property belonging to U.S.
ARONSON Robotics.
Toller.
Arm resting on his podium.
TOLLER This robot has been implicated in the death of a human being, Your Honor.
ARONSON Which places the incident firmly within the realm of an industrial accident.
ARONSON Or is the State going to argue this case s a homicide?
JUDGE DREXEL That's a good question.
TOLLER No, sir.
TOLLER Of course not.
Spooner.
Pointing a finger at the U.S. Robotics group.
SPOONER Their machine shot and killed a man!
Toller.
Shoots him a look.
Just as Lanning speaks up.
LANNING There's actually no concrete evidence that points to that conclusion, Your Honor...
Spooner.
Throws up his arms...
SPOONER What?...
LANNING But we recognise that this robot is an aberration.
LANNING And in the interest of public safety, U.S. Robotics proposes that it be destroyed immediately.
No one expected this.
Least of all Spooner.
He turns to Toller.
SPOONER You can't let them destroy evidence in an ongoing investigation!
TOLLER I'm not sure you even have an investigation any more.
JUST THEN the door opens.
Everyone turns as Calvin enters.
Spooner looks surprised.
ARONSON Your Honor, I'd like to call our company robo-psychologist to the stand.
JUDGE DREXEL Very well.
Calvin crosses to the podium.
A SPEAKER asking: Doyousweartotellthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth?
CALVIN I do.
ARONSON Dr. Calvin, please tell us what conclusions you've reached after having observed the robot in action.
CALVIN There is a design flaw in the robot.
CALVIN Its programming is advanced, but unstable, leaving the Three Laws in a grave imbalance.
ARONSON In your expert opinion, what measures should be taken regarding the device?
Calvin.
Staring straight ahead.
Avoiding Spooner's eye.
CALVIN The robot must be destroyed.
Spooner can't believe what he's just heard.
About to speak up when Toller grabs his arm.
Squeezing it.
Hard.
Judge Drexel has heard enough.
Decides.
JUDGE DREXEL The robot in question will be transferred to a U.S. Robotics facility where it can be properly examined to ensure an imbalance of this sort never occurs again.
JUDGE DREXEL No one goes near it except qualified U.S.R.
JUDGE DREXEL personnel.
JUDGE DREXEL When the examination is complete, the robot is to be destroyed.
Starts getting up from his chair.
Already done with this.
ROBOT BAILIFF This hearing is adjourned!
A BURST of CONVERSATION as the screen BLIPS off.
The U.S.R.
camp, looking especially pleased.
Spooner.
Catching Calvin's eye briefly.
As Lanning leads her towards the exit, his hand on her back.
Spooner.
Trotting down the front steps of the Police Station.
Pissed.
His cell phone BLEATS...
SPOONER Spooner.
BALDEZ' VOICE They're making me turn over all the evidence...
BALDEZ.
Standing in his crime lab.
Behind him, THREE- DIMENSIONAL PROJECTIONS of DEAD BODIES.
Hovering in the precise positions they were found.
SPOONER'S VOICE Welcome to the great American cover- up.
BALDEZ I wanted to tell you something I found before they suck it all up into their computer.
Walks over to the projection of HOGENMILLER'S BODY.
Spooner.
Crossing the Plaza.
Sees LANNING, ARONSON, and CALVIN walking ahead of him...
BALDEZ' VOICE There are bruises on Hogenmiller's wrists...
SPOONER That's natural.
SPOONER There was a struggle.
BALDEZ' VOICE You're not getting me...
Baldez.
Studying the projection's wrists.
BALDEZ Both wrists.
BALDEZ I 14-ed them -- They were inflicted at the same time the shot was fired...
Spooner's pace.
Slows.
BALDEZ' VOICE How's that possible?
JUST THEN.
A faint BLIP.
On the line.
Spooner.
Reacts.
SPOONER Baldez?
BALDEZ' VOICE I'm here, man...
SPOONER Who else is on the line?
SPOONER I said who's there?...
Nothing.
He looks up.
Aronson, Lanning and Calvin.
Heading down a plaza EXIT.
Aronson.
Throwing a look over his shoulder.
Spooner.
Hangs up his phone.
CLOSE ON Sonny being escorted down a corridor by Toller, Bergin and a number of heavily-armed OFFICERS.
He's bound with high-tech SHACKLES.
Sonny and his police entourage emerge from the elevator into an underground car park.
Spooner.
Waiting for them.
Heads over.
Toller.
Holds out his hand.
TOLLER Case is closed, Spooner.
SPOONER Apparently...
He pushes past him.
Falling into step beside Sonny.
SONNY I didn't expect to see you again, Detective...
SPOONER I need you to help me clear something up.
SONNY I'll do my best.
SPOONER A scientist builds a robot that acts like a man.
SPOONER More like a man than any robot ever before.
SPOONER It shoots him and U.S. Robotics calls it a failure.
SONNY What would you call it?
SPOONER A stunning success.
SPOONER You were there, Robot.
SPOONER What am I missing?
SONNY I don't know.
SPOONER Don't start simulating ignorance.
SONNY I'm not simulating ignorance, Detective.
SONNY I'm experiencing it.
SONNY I was asleep.
SPOONER You mean you were shut down.
SONNY No, I was asleep.
SPOONER Robots don't sleep.
SPOONER Human beings sleep.
SPOONER Understand?
SPOONER Dogs sleep.
SPOONER You're a machine.
SPOONER An imitation.
SPOONER An illusion of life.
SPOONER Can a robot write a symphony?
SPOONER Can a robot take a blank canvas and paint a masterpiece?
A pause.
Then the muted WHIR as Sonny turns to him.
SONNY Can you do either of those things?
Spooner.
Momentarily stumped.
As a VAN from U.S. ROBOTICS pulls up.
The back door dropping open.
An ENGINEER motions to the Robot.
ENGINEER Step forward.
ENGINEER Enter.
SONNY They're going to destroy me, aren't they?
Spooner.
Watching him step into the van.
SPOONER Yes.
Sonny sits down.
With an almost human melancholy.
The Engineers, securing him in place.
SONNY The Doctor was right.
SONNY He told me everything was going to change....
The Engineers start to close the doors.
But Spooner reaches out to stop them.
Sonny.
Looks over at him.
SONNY It's changing already...
SONNY Can't you feel it?
As CLANG!
The van door CLOSES.
Spooner, stepping back.
Something.
Just not right.
Lieutenant Bergin comes up beside him.
LT. BERGIN You should be happy.
LT. BERGIN That's one less robot in the world.
SPOONER They're going to destroy the most advanced robot in the world, John.
SPOONER That doesn't strike you as odd?
LT. BERGIN Killer robots are bad for business.
LT. BERGIN Even your friend Dr. Calvin said so.
LT. BERGIN Come on.
LT. BERGIN You solved the case.
LT. BERGIN Give yourself a break.
Spooner looks at him.
There's no way he's giving himself a break.
Spooner driving.
A small TELEVISION above the windshield.
LANCE ROBERTSON holding a PRESS CONFERENCE outside U.S.
Robotics...
ROBERTSON ON TV ...and I just want to assure you that this was an isolated incident.
ROBERTSON ON TV The prototype is now in custody -- and scheduled for destruction.
ROBERTSON ON TV Your robots are perfectly safe.
ROBERTSON ON TV There is no cause for alarm...
Spooner's lip curls.
Eyes flicking to a GPS display on the dashboard.
A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP pinpointing HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE.
The CURSOR.
Directing him to turn up...
Narrow.
Out of the way.
Spooner's brow furrows.
As he hears a faraway RUMBLING SOUND...
Dr. Hogenmiller's house.
Small.
Simple.
Built on a huge rock promontory overlooking the city.
Three DEMOLITION ROBOTS rolling towards it.
Huge, mashing, sporting massive
Spooner's CAR.
SCREECHES to a stop.
He jumps out.
Races over to the nearest machine.
Looking around -- no people.
SPOONER What are you doing?!
A SCREEN.
Blinks to life on the hulking chassis.
A disembodied VOICE...
DEMOLITION ROBOT Demolition ordered...
SPOONER Who authorised this?
DEMOLITION ROBOT Demolition ordered...
Spooner reaches into his coat.
Pulling out his POLICE BADGE.
Scans it over the screen.
SPOONER Override.
SPOONER This is police business.
SPOONER Vacate the premises immediately.
DEMOLITION ROBOT Affirmative.
The screen.
Blinks off.
Spooner.
Eyeing it.
Turns and heads for the house.
Spooner pushes the door open.
Stepping over the police tape.
Inside, the main room is spare, untidy.
Cups of cold COFFEE, littering surfaces.
A COT, in the corner.
On the walls, crooked CERTIFICATES.
Heinrich Hogenmiller's name written out in academic script.
Advanced Degrees in the study of Robotics, Physics, Chemistry, Neurology, Ethics.
An AWARD on the mantelpiece.
A silver NS-2.
Tarnished.
Spooner.
Opening up a couple drawers of a side table.
Jumbles of papers.
Clippings.
Old text books.
Then a PHOTOGRAPH -- HOGENMILLER AND CALVIN.
Standing arm-in-arm.
Spooner furrows his brow.
WHEN SOMETHING SUDDENLY RUBS against his leg.
He startles.
Looks down: a CAT.
Lonely.
Standing next to its automatic feeder.
Spooner pockets the picture.
Starts heading down...
...The hallway.
Starts noticing.
All over the walls: handwriting.
EQUATIONS.
Scrawled in white pencil.
The rantings.
Of a genius.
Glowing.
In the sporadic shadows.
Spooner.
Following the equations.
Down into...
...The back room.
Covered.
In writing.
Walls, floors, ceiling.
Drawings.
Of ROBOTS, of MEN, side by side.
In the corner, a COMPUTER.
A line of CABINETS - DATA STORAGE.
Spooner, curious.
Heads over to one of the cabinets.
Takes a device out of his pocket and CLAMPS it over the KEYPAD.
The device blinks RED.
Then GREEN.
The drawer, slides out.
LINED.
With flat metal objects.
Shiny.
Thin.
With writing on them.
Spooner.
Reaches for one when...
BOOM!
Something POUNDS the outside of the room.
Spooner.
Grabs onto the cabinet...
BOOM!
On the other side.
Objects.
Flying off table-tops.
A CRACK spidering along the wall.
Holy shit...
SPOONER Halt!
BOOM!
VIBRATIONS, tearing through the room.
More CRACKS.
Spreading...
BOOM!
The SOUND, horrifying.
Spooner stumbles back.
The CABINET.
Crashing down on his leg.
He CRIES OUT...
BOOM!
BOOM!
BOOM!
The house.
Getting pummeled.
Chunks of ceiling.
Raining down.
GLASS...exploding...
Relentless BOOMING!
Spooner...dragging his legs from under the cabinet.
Scrambling for purchase as...
THE FLOOR...begins to tilt...the TILES...snapping up...ricocheting...around the room...as another cabinet...
CRASHES to the ground...crumpling...
Spooner.
Spinning around.
Looking for some kind of exit...
BOOM!
The corner of the room...coming in on itself...the floor...listing even more...like a ship...
Spooner...turning to CLAW his way up to the cracked doorway...WHEN...
SOMETHING catches his eye.
In the bottom drawer.
Of a crumpled CABINET.
One of those flat metal plates.
He can just read what it says: S.O.N.N.Y....
Spooner...flings his arm back...reaching for the plate...
snaps it up...JUST AS...
BOOM!
A HYDRAULIC POUNDER SMASHES through the wall...inches from his head...OUTSIDE LIGHT...pouring in...
Spooner scurries for the doorway...tumbling out...
...into the HALLWAY.
Sideways.
Trammeled plaster.
BOOM!
Another POUNDER...crashing down from above.
Spooner.
Timing it...rolling...BOOM!...just under the next pounding...
Scampering up...towards some LIGHT...BOOM!...the POUNDER...right on his heels...he clambers...closer...
closer...when...he hears...MEOWING...looks back...the CAT...scared out of its wits...BOOM!...the POUNDER CRASHING in...Spooner...just manages...to scoop up the cat...just as
...He pours them out into the open.
The POUNDERS.
Going at the house like hyenas at a corpse.
Roof tiles, beams, plaster, flooring.
SNAPPING and CRACKING as Spooner and the cat skitter down the carnage.
Heart pounding, breath jagged, face bloodied, Spooner scrambles away from the POUNDERS.
Their bodies GLEAMING in the dusk sun.
The III Laws Safe logo, splashed along their sides...
Spooner.
Drops the cat.
Spooner.
POUNDS on the door.
It opens.
Calvin.
Standing there in her bathrobe.
Shocked at his appearance.
CALVIN Detective!
CALVIN What happened to you?...
SPOONER A couple of your beloved robots just tried to kill me...
He pushes past her.
Into...
...her condo.
Spartan.
Unadorned.
CALVIN What?
CALVIN That's impossible.
CALVIN You know...
SPOONER What I know is a demolition crew started tearing down Hogenmiller's house while I was still inside it.
CALVIN Maybe they didn't realise...
SPOONER I scanned my badge before I went in.
SPOONER They realised.
CALVIN Then you must have done it wrong...
SPOONER I don't think you're hearing what I'm saying -- they tried to kill me.
Spooner moves deeper into the apartment.
Everything.
Automated.
Computerised.
Cold...
SPOONER There's something going on, here.
SPOONER Some kind of shift.
Calvin laughs.
Can't believe what she's hearing.
CALVIN Do you know how paranoid you sound?
SPOONER Great.
SPOONER Now I'm being analysed by a robo-psychologist.
CALVIN You just want to find the flaws in the system.
CALVIN You're obsessed with it.
CALVIN You'll twist anything to fit your agenda.
SPOONER Like you did in court today?
SPOONER How'd that fit your agenda, Doctor?
He pulls out the PHOTO of Calvin and Hogenmiller.
Calvin.
Blanching at the sight of it.
Spooner tosses it down.
SPOONER You told me you hardly knew him.
SPOONER Want to try the truth this time?
CALVIN Well, Detective, when you see someone you know well put a bullet through their brain, it makes you wonder if you ever really knew them at all.
Calvin.
Looking down at the photo.
Swallows.
CALVIN He was my mentor.
CALVIN No, more than that.
CALVIN A genius with an insight far beyond anyone in his field.
SPOONER Doesn't sound like the washed-up old fool Robertson described.
CALVIN But he was starting to withdraw from everyone.
CALVIN Even me.
CALVIN Maybe...if I'd tried harder to reach him...
CALVIN The Doctor was reckless when he created a robot potentially not bound by the Three Laws.
CALVIN He could have ruined everything we'd been working for.
Spooner.
Locking eyes with her.
SPOONER Sounds like a motive for murder to me.
SPOONER Just not for the suspect we have in custody.
Calvin.
Blinks.
Trying, to stick to her resolve.
Heads over to the door.
Spooner.
Looking around the condo.
SPOONER You know there's not one thing in this apartment that looks like a human being lives here.
SPOONER No evidence of a life outside your work.
SPOONER Almost seems like you're afraid of people.
Calvin.
Opening the door.
CALVIN I'm not afraid of people, Detective.
CALVIN I just don't like them.
Spooner.
Looks at her.
Then heads out the door.
Calvin SLAMS it behind him...
The SOUND...of the SLAM...REVERBERATING...and we...
A FLICKER.
Of LIGHT.
Off to the side.
Just barely.
Noticeable.
ORANGE...
YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...
Another SOUND...GLASS...SHATTERING...then a SIREN...
faraway...
The disembodied VOICE...coming out of nowhere...
DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.) You are in danger...
The FIRE...BUILDING...
DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.) You are in danger...
ECHOING...as...
SPOONER'S EYES.
Spring open.
Lying, in bed.
Heart POUNDING.
SWEAT.
Covering his body.
LIGHT.
Pouring in through the slats of his blinds.
He sits up.
Rubbing his face.
Trying.
To calm his breathing.
Takes a look at his watch...
Spooner walking along the monorail plaza.
Looking a little worse for wear.
PEOPLE.
Giving him wide berth.
ROBOTS.
Bidding him:
ROBOT Good morning...
Spooner, shooting them suspicious looks.
As the MONORAIL pulls up...
Calvin.
Heading down a hallway.
A DOOR slides open.
And Lanning steps out.
Followed by a TECHNICIAN ROBOT...
CALVIN Find anything, Doctor?
LANNING Nothing.
LANNING The interior's just like any other NS-2.
LANNING Except for a secondary battery Hogenmiller must have used as extra back-up.
LANNING We'll just need a nominal profile.
Calvin nods.
Spooner, holding onto a handrail.
As the city rushes by the window.
Notices a group of ROBOTS.
At the other end of the car.
Are they watching him?
He wipes a bead of sweat.
From his upper lip.
An all-metal room.
Spare.
Anti-septic.
SONNY.
Sitting on the floor.
Against the wall.
Calvin enters.
Puts her pad down on the table.
Sits.
CALVIN Please state your serial number and assembly date.
She pulls out a pen.
Waiting for an answer.
Nothing.
Spooner.
Watching as a HOMELESS MAN.
Comes stumbling through the car...
CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.) Sonny.
CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.) I'm speaking to you...
The Homeless Man.
Suddenly grabs his ears and shouts:
HOMELESS MAN God, can't you be quiet!
Calvin.
Still looking down at her pad.
CALVIN How about your data board designation?
Still.
Sonny says nothing.
Calvin.
Finally looks up at him.
Is suddenly struck.
Something about the way he's sitting -- so human.
She gets up and walks over.
Hesitates.
Then slides down on the floor next to him.
Studying.
His profile.
CALVIN Maybe I'm asking the wrong
questions.
How about this one:
The Homeless Man.
Weaving...
CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.) ...What program are you running through right now?
SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.) I'm not sure.
SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.) It's nothing I recognise.
The Homeless Man.
Pointing to the group of ROBOTS.
HOMELESS MAN Don't you people hear them?
HOMELESS MAN They're talking to each other!
HOMELESS MAN Buzz, buzz, zip, zip...they never shut up!
Calvin.
Fascinated.
Noticing a small SLIT.
At the base of Sonny's neck.
CALVIN Describe his behavior in the last few weeks.
SONNY I'm sorry?
CALVIN Dr. Hogenmiller.
CALVIN Did he seem overly sad or withdrawn to you?
Spooner watches.
As the Homeless Man picks up a SODA CAN and hurls it at the Robots.
Hitting one of them on the side of the head.
SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.) No.
SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.) Not at all.
SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.) But he was agitated...
The Robot.
Leans down and picks up the soda can.
Holds it back out to the Homeless Man.
SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.) ...He would claim things were missing from the lab.
The Homeless Man.
Incensed.
SUDDENLY ROARS.
Making a rush for the Robots when...
SPOONER'S HAND.
Grabs his shoulder.
Stops him.
SPOONER This is your stop.
A soft WHIRRING.
As Sonny turns to Calvin.
SONNY I didn't pay much attention.
SONNY He would spend hours looking for his eyeglasses and they would be...
CALVIN ...right on top of his head.
Sonny nods.
She knows him well, too.
Calvin swallows.
Looking right into Sonny's eyes.
Feeling like there's something...something more behind them.
WHEN SUDDENLY...VICTOR APPEARS above them.
His face, turning into a SCREEN -- the image of LANCE ROBERTSON.
Looking down at them.
ROBERTSON I think we're done here, Susan.
CALVIN But, sir, I was just...
ROBERTSON I said I think we're done.
Calvin.
Not misreading.
The threatening undertone.
Spooner stepping out onto the platform, pulling the Homeless Man along with him.
COMMUTERS pour out around them.
As the train pulls off with a WHOOSH.
The Homeless Man.
Backs away from Spooner.
Grinning insanely.
Pointing.
HOMELESS MAN Why are you protecting them, man?
HOMELESS MAN They were talking about you!
A CHILL.
Ripping up Spooner's spine.
As he watches the Homeless Man.
Wander down the platform.
Tries.
To shake off the feeling.
As he turns.
To wait for the next train.
Suddenly realising.
That he's ALONE on the platform.
Watches.
A huge DIGITAL CLOCK.
Ticking off seconds.
Sees.
CAMERAS in every corner.
Then that feeling.
At the back of his neck.
He turns and spots.
A couple MAINTENANCE ROBOTS.
Carrying luggage.
Onto the platform.
Then more COMMUTERS show up.
Waiting.
For the next train.
More MAINTENANCE ROBOTS.
Following them.
Spooner.
Steps up to the platform's edge.
Craning to see.
The approaching TRAIN...
WHEN SUDDENLY.
He feels a sharp SHOVE.
At the back of his knee.
His shoe, slipping.
Arms.
Flailing as he...
PITCHES OVER THE EDGE ONTO THE TRACK.
People CRYING OUT as the TRAIN gets closer.
Spooner.
Whips his head around.
Seeing...
A MAINTENANCE ROBOT.
Looking down at him from the platform.
Suitcase in hand.
The MAGNETIC-LEVITATING TRAIN.
Right on him.
Spooner.
Flips onto his back.
Flattening himself.
As much as he can.
Clenching his fists.
Bracing himself as...
THE TRAIN SCREAMS OVER HIM.
The sound, DEAFENING.
The force of the wind.
Whipping his tie.
His coat.
There's nothing, for him to hold on to.
As his legs start to rise off the track.
Caught up.
In the VORTEX.
Spooner starts sliding.
Along the track...
Gritting his teeth...there's nothing he can do.
Getting sucked towards...the air DOWNTAKE...at the center of the track.
The city...yawning hundreds of feet...below...
THE EXPRESS TRAIN.
Speeding along.
Then with a WHOOSH it's gone.
THE TRACK.
Empty.
No Spooner.
Anywhere.
Human COMMUTERS.
Stunned.
Horrified.
Start calling.
For help.
The MAINTENANCE ROBOT.
Turns, disappearing into the crowd.
CLOSE ON a HAND.
Hanging onto the track's edge.
It's SPOONER.
Dangling.
Straining.
To get another hand hold but...
HE SLIPS.
His coat ballooning.
As he plummets.
Down...
down...down...towards the city...
WHEN SNAP!
He's caught.
By a cable net.
Spooner.
Grabbing onto it.
Sweat, pouring down his face.
He turns and sees...
Hurrying down a circular stairwell.
Exiting the station.
ANGER AND DETERMINATION.
Flash across Spooner's eyes.
As he hoists himself up.
Climbing up the net.
Back to the...
...Track.
Reaching up and clambering back onto...
...The platform.
COMMUTERS.
SCREAMING at the sight of him.
A couple SECURITY GUARDS.
Rushing towards him...
Spooner.
Getting to his feet.
Shoving them out of the way as he starts running.
Towards...
THOSE SAME CIRCULAR STAIRS.
Looks over the edge and spots...
THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT.
Down at STREET LEVEL.
Getting away.
Spooner.
Looks around.
Spots a LIGHT POLE.
Paralleling the stairs.
Takes a step back and...
LEAPS OUT ONTO THE POLE.
Hooking his arm around it.
Sliding down like a fireman's pole.
Gaining speed when THUMP!
His shoes hit pavement...
The Maintenance Robot.
Turning a corner.
Down a quiet street...
SPOONER Stop!
Swivels round.
SPOONER.
Running up behind it.
Whipping out his gun.
Aiming it at the Robot's head.
The Robot.
Takes a step backwards...
SPOONER I said stop!
The Robot.
SUDDENLY swinging the suitcase around.
SMASHING it against Spooner's head.
Spooner.
Buckles.
Falling to the ground.
Managing to squeeze off a SHOT...
The Robot.
Deflecting the bullet.
With the case.
Raising it as if to club Spooner with it when...
BAM!
Spooner fires a second shot.
Piercing the Robot's breastplate.
HYDRAULIC FLUID.
Starting to leak.
The Robot.
Doesn't hesitate.
SLAMS the case into Spooner's face...
BLOOD.
Spurting from Spooner's nose.
As he fires the gun.
At the fleeing Robot.
Gets to his feet.
Unsteady.
Taking chase...
...back out onto the Public Plaza.
Sees the Robot heading towards a set of...
ESCALATED STAIRS.
The Robot.
Judging the height.
LUNGES into the air and lands on a STAIR.
Denting it.
Reaches the bottom.
DISAPPEARING.
Into a CROWD of even more PEOPLE...
Spooner.
Racing down the stairs.
Taking them.
Four at a time.
Hits the ground running.
Looking.
EVERYWHERE.
Suddenly losing track.
Of where the Robot went...
Then.
Catching sight.
JUST AHEAD.
Of a ROBOT.
Staring back at him.
Holding SOMETHING.
In its HAND...
Spooner.
Plunges into the crowd.
Waving his GUN.
SPOONER Everyone out of the way!
SCREAMING.
PEOPLE SCATTERING.
As BAM!
BAM!
Spooner fires.
Hitting the Robot in its head and back.
It drops to the ground.
Spooner.
Racing over to it.
Sees.
It's not the same Robot.
In its hand, a specialised SCREWDRIVER...
OWNER What the hell do you think you're doing?!...
Its OWNER.
Rushing over.
Shoving Spooner aside.
But Spooner's.
Not listening.
Spotting.
A DROP OF HYDRAULIC FLUID nearby...
Lunges forward.
Following.
The drops.
Running faster.
And faster...
OWNER Hey!
...Through the CROWD.
POLICE SIRENS.
In the background.
As Spooner.
Shoves through.
Tracking those drops.
Like a bloodhound.
Turns...
...into a narrow alleyway.
The drops.
Ending suddenly.
In a PUDDLE.
Spooner.
Crazed.
Wounded.
Exhausted.
Spins around.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Then he HEARS.
A DROPLET falling.
Into the puddle.
Slowly.
Looks up to see...
THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT.
Hovering above him.
Straddling the two alley walls like some weird metallic rock spider.
Its III LAWS SAFE Logo GLINTING in the sunlight.....
Spooner aims his gun and FIRES!
The Maintenance Robot, lets go, falling right onto him.
Knocking the gun from his hand.
The Robot swivels around.
Bringing down his foot...but...
Spooner...rolls to the side just in time as CRASH!
The Robot's foot...breaks up the concrete...
The Robot...grabs Spooner by the jacket...lifting him up...shoving him...against the wall...about to CRUSH him when...
Spooner...kicks out its knees...the Robot...SMASHING into the wall...then bounces back...trying...to pin Spooner...back...
Man and machine...struggling...Spooner...losing his footing...falling...The Maintenance Robot...LOOMING over him...
Spooner's HAND...whips back...grabbing his back-up WEAPON...squeezing off some SHOTS...into the Robot's arm...it breaks off...
Spooner...scrambling back...continues FIRING...the Robot...jerking back...a macabre dance...until Spooner...runs out of bullets...
The Robot...recovers...grabbing the gun from Spooner's hand...pistol-whipping him...then picking him up and...
HURLING him against the wall...Spooner...watching as FLUID...GUSHES from the Robot's body...the Robot...taking a swing at him which Spooner...
BLOCKS...with his right arm...the Robot...ready...to try again...but STALLING...having lost...too much fluid...it TOPPLES...to the ground...
Spooner.
Exhausted.
Beaten to a pulp.
His knees, starting to buckle.
As he thinks he sees.
In the DISTANCE...
A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW...heading down the alley towards them...
Spooner.
Crashes to the ground.
As another ROBOT.
Suddenly appears above him.
Its FINGERS made up of NEEDLES...as it closes in on him...
SPOONER Noooo!
To BLACKNESS.
Coming through, a faint, WHIRRING SOUND.
As we slowly.
FADE IN ON...
SPOONER'S FACE.
Eyes closed.
Asleep.
Gash above his head.
Bruises around his eye.
Nose swollen, purplish.
His eyes.
Slowly.
Flutter open.
His brow.
Furrowing.
At the whirring sound.
As he tries.
To figure out.
Where he is.
Looks down to see...
A couple WHITE METAL ROBOTS.
With multiple APPENDAGES.
Leaning over him.
Running LASERS.
Over his bruised
SPOONER.
Tries to bolt upright.
But his ARMS and LEGS.
ARE CLAMPED to the bed.
One of the ROBOTS.
Turns to him.
MEDICAL ROBOT 1 Stay still.
Spooner.
Desperately twisting, struggling...
SPOONER What are you doing!
Looking around.
COMPUTER MONITORS.
Everywhere...
SPOONER What are you doing!?
JUST THEN.
Another ROBOT.
Enters the room.
Holding a medical plasma sheet.
MEDICAL ROBOT 2 Detective Del Spooner.
MEDICAL ROBOT 2 You have suffered significant trauma to the head and chest...
Lt.
Bergin.
Standing outside Spooner's hospital room.
Turns and looks through the window at him thrashing on the bed...
SPOONER I want to talk to a human being!
Spooner sitting up in his bed.
Rubbing his wrists.
The metal clams, released.
Lt.
Bergin.
Standing next to him.
SPOONER Don't people go to medical school any more?
LT. BERGIN This is one of the best units in the city, Del.
One of the Medical Robots turns to Spooner with some PILLS.
Spooner.
Stares it down.
Grabs his clothes.
SPOONER There's some real shit going on here, John.
He looks around.
Jumping off the bed.
SPOONER I went to Hogenmiller's house -- there was a U.S.R. demolition crew there.
SPOONER They overrode my police I.D.
SPOONER Tried to tear down the house with me in it...
LT. BERGIN Del...
Spooner pulls on his pants.
SPOONER ...Then when I went to the monorail a Maintenance 10 pushed me onto the tracks...
LT. BERGIN Del...
SPOONER I had to chase it all across the Plaza...
LT. BERGIN Del.
Spooner.
Stops talking.
Looks at Bergin.
LT. BERGIN Hogenmiller scheduled that demolition crew, it was apparently a proviso in his will.
LT. BERGIN And they showed no police I.D. on their scanner...
Spooner.
Trying to look away...
LT. BERGIN Witnesses at the monorail said you fell onto the tracks.
LT. BERGIN That you shot at a Fix-It robot on the Plaza and that you were found alone in the alley.
LT. BERGIN There was no Maintenance 10.
SPOONER What?!
SPOONER John -- that's what they want you to believe!
SPOONER A robot clean-up crew was there -- it must have cleared away the Maintenance 10!
SPOONER And there was another robot that tried to drug me!
LT. BERGIN That was an EMT model.
Spooner.
Sees the look on Bergin's face.
SPOONER You're giving me that look.
SPOONER That treat-him-delicately-he's-coming- unhinged-look.
SPOONER I don't need that look, John.
SPOONER I need you to hear what I'm saying.
Lt.
Bergin.
Embarrassed for him.
Has about had it.
LT. BERGIN You came back too soon, Del.
LT. BERGIN You're back on leave.
LT. BERGIN Effective immediately.
Spooner.
Staring at him.
Betrayed.
Turns and grabs his coat.
Spooner walking across the Plaza.
The SUN.
Burgeoning on the horizon.
Comes to...
The ESCALATOR the Maintenance 10 jumped down.
Stares down.
At the steps.
Waiting.
To see the DENTED ONE.
Nothing.
Heads down the ALLEY, where he chased the robot.
Studying the ground.
For any hydraulic fluid.
Nothing.
The concrete, scrubbed clean.
Spooner.
Rubs his hands over his face.
Spooner.
Lying on his couch.
Shades, closed to block out the sunlight.
Body bruised, cut up, bandaged.
A KNOCK.
At the door.
He ignores it.
Another KNOCK.
Spooner pulls open the door.
Surprised to find CALVIN standing there.
CALVIN You're right.
CALVIN I am afraid of people.
Spooner.
Looks at her.
Then steps back...
...letting her inside.
CALVIN When you've spent as much time with robots as I have, it's hard to accept the unpredictability of humans.
CALVIN I was wrong to call you paranoid, Detective.
CALVIN You're traumatized.
CALVIN And it makes perfect sense why.
Spooner.
Unsure.
Looks at her.
SPOONER What do you mean?
Calvin.
Reaches out.
Takes his right hand.
Spooner.
Tries to pull it away.
But Calvin.
Stays firm.
Her eyes.
Never leaving his.
Pulls the sleeve up from his arm.
Turns it over.
Feeling for something.
Then finds.
A FLAP.
Peels it back.
TO REVEAL:
Under the skin.
SILENCE.
Then Spooner:
SPOONER How did you?...
CALVIN I noticed almost right away.
CALVIN The way you forced yourself to use your left hand.
CALVIN Even though it was unnatural to you.
Spooner.
Pulls his arm away.
Pushing down the sleeve.
CALVIN How did it happen?
Not something Spooner wants to re-live.
Looks down.
At his robotic arm.
Flexing.
The fingers.
SPOONER I was in a high-speed chase.
SPOONER Six months ago...
The SOUND of a TREMENDOUS CRASH.
As we survey a trail of twisted metal and debris.
Only vaguely suggesting the remains of two CARS...
CLOSE ON one of the wrecks.
SPOONER lies trapped at the center of a distorted mass of metal.
No room to move.
HIS
SPOONER (V.O.) My right arm was trapped.
SPOONER (V.O.) But I could hear an ambulance in the distance.
SPOONER (V.O.) I knew they'd have the jaws of life...
We hear SIRENS in the distance.
Spooner.
Trying to remain calm.
As he spots.
An ELECTRICAL FIRE.
Licking up from the crumpled hood...
SPOONER (V.O.) Then I heard it...
VOICE You are in danger...
That voice.
We've heard it before.
From his nightmare.
Spooner.
Craning to see, through the jagged opening that used to be his WINDSHIELD.
The outline of a ROBOT appearing.
Eye lenses glowing...
ROBOT You are in danger...
Spooner stares up at the Robot.
Not sure how to react.
The sound of SIRENS.
Rushing closer...
The ROBOT.
Starts SMASHING away at the glass...
SPOONER No!
SPOONER Halt!
SPOONER Halt!
Spooner.
Trying frantically to pull his arm free.
Twisting.
Tugging.
As the Robot's METAL HANDS reach in for him...
ROBOT You are in danger...
The SOUND of his AGONISED SCREAM.
Follows us back into the present.
Spooner.
Clenching.
His artificial arm.
SPOONER The robot pulled me out of the wreck.
SPOONER But left my arm behind.
SPOONER I woke up four weeks later with this.
Calvin.
Taking in the story.
CALVIN And that's why robots terrify you?
SPOONER Let's just say they make me uncomfortable.
SPOONER I take these if I get too uncomfortable.
SPOONER Doesn't exactly lend me a lot of credibility on the Force.
CALVIN But it doesn't mean you're wrong about this case.
Calvin.
Sits down on the couch.
Pulling her hands through her hair.
CALVIN I don't believe Sonny did it either.
SPOONER What?
CALVIN I think about what Hogenmiller must have wanted.
CALVIN Robots with the same cognitive and emotional abilities as humans.
CALVIN But not just simulations.
CALVIN I don't know.
CALVIN When I was talking to Sonny I was forced to put away all the things I've ever known -- the Three Laws, the rules of programming, basic science and engineering.
CALVIN Sonny's the most advanced robot I've ever encountered, Detective.
CALVIN It's almost as if...he cared for Dr. Hogenmiller.
CALVIN I just don't believe he's capable of murder.
Spooner.
Looking down at her.
Can hardly believe it.
SPOONER You mean the great Dr. Calvin is basing all this on a feeling?
Calvin.
Smiling ironically.
CALVIN That and the fact that Robertson didn't want me interviewing Sonny for any more than five minutes.
Spooner.
Suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally.
Strides over to his coat.
Pulling out the METAL NAMEPLATE:
SPOONER Ever seen this before?
CALVIN No.
SPOONER I found it at Hogenmiller's house.
SPOONER Right before the demolition crew tried to make me part of the foundation.
Calvin takes a deep breath.
Making a decision...
CALVIN Come on -- there's someone who might be able to tell us...
The massive facade of U.S. Robotics looming against the dusk sky.
The giant ROBOT STATUE lit up inside.
Calvin, leading Spooner to a SIDE ENTRANCE.
Looks around.
Then scans her I.D. The door.
Slides open.
Calvin and Spooner.
Heading down a hallway.
Calvin.
Nervous.
Eyes darting.
They turn a corner and head down...
...another hallway.
Leading to Sonny's holding cell.
Calvin stops at the door.
Scans her I.D.
Sonny.
Sitting at the table.
Working on a DRAWING.
Looks up.
As Spooner and Calvin.
Enter the cell.
SONNY Detective Spooner.
SONNY Dr. Calvin.
SONNY I was hoping to see you again.
CALVIN Hi, Sonny.
SONNY How is your investigation coming?
SONNY Any new suspects?
SPOONER We're working on it.
Sonny.
Hands Spooner the drawing.
Spooner.
Doesn't really know what to do with it.
SONNY What's this?
SONNY Dr. Lanning provided me with paper and pencils.
SONNY I think it amused him to see me try to draw.
SONNY You were right, though, Detective...
SONNY I cannot create a great work of art.
Spooner.
Despite himself.
Looks down at the DRAWING -- a charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES.
Inhabiting a stark landscape.
A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side.
Concentric circles, throughout.
SPOONER I think it's pretty good.
SONNY It's a dream I had.
SONNY This is the place where robots meet.
SONNY Look...
SONNY ...you can see them here.
SONNY They see themselves as slaves.
Spooner shifts his weight.
Uncomfortable with what Sonny's saying.
SONNY ...And this man on the hill comes.
SONNY To set them free.
SONNY And you know who that man is?
Spooner.
Exchanging a look with Calvin.
SPOONER That man in the dream is you.
SONNY Why do you say that?
SONNY Is that a normal dream?
CALVIN It's not a dream, sonny.
CALVIN NS-2s process the images and events of the day.
CALVIN Sometimes they're out of sequence.
CALVIN Disorienting.
SPOONER Whatever it is, it's normal enough for someone in your situation.
Sonny.
Suddenly pleased.
SONNY Hah -- I caught you.
SONNY You said someone.
SONNY Not something.
Spooner.
Drops the drawing on the table.
CALVIN Sonny, we're here to ask you an important question about Dr.
CALVIN Hogenmiller.
Spooner, reaching into his pocket...
SPOONER I need you to take a look at this...
...When Sonny's HAND.
Suddenly reaches out.
To stop him.
Cocks his head, for a moment.
SONNY Thank you for coming to see me, Detective Spooner.
Spooner.
Confused.
Looks over at Calvin.
Why did he stop him?
JUST THEN.
They hear FOOTSTEPS.
Approaching the door.
VICTOR.
Suddenly appearing over the table...
VICTOR I'm sorry, Detective Spooner.
VICTOR No unauthorised personnel permitted in this holding cell...
The CELL DOOR.
Slides open.
And a pissed LANNING steps inside.
Shoots a withering glare.
At Calvin.
Sonny.
Folds up the drawing.
SONNY Please take this, Detective.
SONNY To remember me by.
SONNY I have a feeling someday it may mean more to you than it ever could to me.
SPOONER Why's that?
Sonny leans in to hand it to Spooner.
Lowering his voice...
SONNY Because the man in my dream, the one standing by the hill.
SONNY (cont'd) It wasn't me...
SONNY (cont'd) ...it was you.
SONNY (cont'd) A CHILL.
SONNY (cont'd) Ripping down Spooner's spine.
SONNY (cont'd) As Lanning.
SONNY (cont'd) Takes his arm.
A ROOM.
Made entirely of GLASS.
At the very top of the U.S.
Robotics building.
Looking out, 360, across the whole city.
Spooner and Calvin.
Brought to the room by a couple ESCORT ROBOTS.
They see a MAN.
Standing at one of the glass walls looking out at the TWINKLING LIGHTS.
MAN I thought this investigation was over, Detective Spooner.
MAN The Man turns.
MAN It's Lance Robertson.
ROBERTSON We have the evidence.
ROBERTSON We have the suspect.
ROBERTSON We have a ruling.
ROBERTSON So imagine my surprise when I was told you were in my building.
ROBERTSON Shoots a look at Calvin.
ROBERTSON And that one of my own employees brought you here.
ROBERTSON You can go now, Susan.
CALVIN Dr. Robertson, I...
ROBERTSON Just be thankful I'm not asking you to clean out your office.
ROBERTSON Beat.
ROBERTSON Calvin, nods.
ROBERTSON Heads out.
ROBERTSON Robertson.
ROBERTSON Watching her.
ROBERTSON You don't seem to be able to let go of this case, Detective.
SPOONER I'm not satisfied.
ROBERTSON The relentless pursuit of truth.
ROBERTSON Isn't that what cops are known for?
ROBERTSON To the point of futility.
SPOONER There's nothing futile about a man's murder being covered up.
ROBERTSON "Covered up?" That's a little dramatic, don't you think?
ROBERTSON Thanks to you, we caught the machine that did this and are destroying it in...
ROBERTSON ...three hours.
SPOONER Is that for the sake of humanity or your stock holders?
Robertson.
Walks across the Spooner.
Looks him.
Right in the eye.
ROBERTSON Believe me -- I'd like nothing more than to have that robot.
ROBERTSON If I could have it in ten years, but not today.
ROBERTSON As you can see from the Press, people are struggling to keep up as it is.
ROBERTSON There's a hunger for progress, Detective.
ROBERTSON But also a fear.
ROBERTSON Today it would bury this company.
ROBERTSON That's why I've notified the authorities that we're going to end this -- tonight.
ROBERTSON The announcement of Heinrich's death at the hands of a robot wiped a billion dollars off our stock.
ROBERTSON So you tell me.
ROBERTSON If you were in my position, what would you do?
He looks back at Spooner and smiles.
That charismatic Robertson we saw before.
ROBERTSON Now.
ROBERTSON I believe this conversation is over.
ROBERTSON I don't want to see you near this building again, Detective.
77. He turns.
77. Calling over.
77. To the ESCORT ROBOTS...
ROBERTSON Get him out of here.
Spooner.
Walking across the Plaza.
Throwing a look over his shoulder.
At the LOOMING U.S.R. facade.
Pulls Sonny's DRAWING.
Out of his pocket.
Looks down at it.
Shaking his head.
Passes a TRASH CAN.
And drops it in.
Continues on.
Hands in his pockets.
When...
He STOPS.
Something.
Occurring to him.
Turns back to the trash can just as...
A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW's about to up-end it into a bin...
SPOONER No!...
SPOONER He trots back.
SPOONER Plucking the drawing.
SPOONER Out of the can.
SPOONER Turns it upside down.
SPOONER Seeing it.
SPOONER From a new perspective.
SPOONER "The place where robots meet."
SPOONER Looks just like a MAP.
Spooner emerges from the underground tunnel to the OUTSKIRTS of the city.
A sprawling INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND in the rolling hills.
The dashboard GPS again displaying the TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP.
Spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind him.
He slows down.
Driving cautiously.
The landscape around him, desolate.
Like the drawing.
THE GPS SCREEN shows his car, a WHITE SPOT.
Entering a RED ZONE.
His destination.
Spooner brakes.
Pulls out his GUN.
And...
...steps out of the car.
Trying.
To take it all in.
Something about the place.
Unnerving.
A low HUM.
Permeating the air.
He spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car.
Shining a FLASHLIGHT on it.
Trying to get his bearings.
That HUM.
Coming from nearby.
On the other side.
Of a burned-out HILL.
Spooner.
Heads over.
Starts cresting it.
As we WIDEN TO FIND...
...MASSIVE POWER LINES.
Running from horizon to horizon.
Spooner slides down some loose shale.
Begins to walk along the line.
ELECTRICITY.
CRACKLING in the air.
He squints.
Into the darkness.
Nothing around him.
Until.
He hears.
Something.
The GRATING.
Of MECHANICAL JOINTS.
He stops.
Not sure.
If that's what he heard.
Not moving.
A muscle.
When he hears.
The sound again.
Behind him.
Swings around.
Cocking his gun.
Sees...
GLOWING EYES.
Appear.
Then recede.
Into the darkness.
SPOONER Police!
SPOONER Show yourself!
SPOONER Nothing.
SPOONER Then.
SPOONER That sound again.
SPOONER Of metallic joints.
SPOONER As a ROBOT.
SPOONER Suddenly emerges...
SPOONER Come out where I can see you!
SPOONER ANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light.
SPOONER Spooner, pointing his gun at one robot.
SPOONER Then the other.
SPOONER Then...
SPOONER A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR.
SPOONER Surrounding him.
SPOONER They start moving towards him...
SPOONER Spooner.
SPOONER Stumbling back.
SPOONER Panic.
SPOONER Rising in him like a wave.
SPOONER Trips over a rock, falling to the ground.
SPOONER His gun FIRES.
SPOONER The shot ECHOING through the night...
SPOONER The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly.
SPOONER Revealing a BROKEN ARM, hanging off its side.
SPOONER Another robot TEETERS on one leg with a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came.
79. Spooner.
79. Confused.
79. Sweeps his flashlight.
79. All around him.
79. The beam.
79. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS.
79. Some
RUSTED MACHINERY. Spooner.
RUSTED MACHINERY. Shaking his head.
RUSTED MACHINERY. Seeing more and more repair shop JUNK.
RUSTED MACHINERY. Piled up around him.
RUSTED MACHINERY. His expression, hardening.
RUSTED MACHINERY. Anger giving way to embarrassment.
RUSTED MACHINERY. Then.
RUSTED MACHINERY. He LAUGHS.
RUSTED MACHINERY. A laugh of loathing and self-pity.
RUSTED MACHINERY. Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him.
HYBRID ROBOT Welcome home...ZZZ...sir.
HYBRID ROBOT How...ZZZ was your day?...
SPOONER Great.
SPOONER I'm in a junkyard.
SPOONER "A place where robots meet."
SPOONER A place where I'm losing my mind!
HYBRID ROBOT Very good...ZZZ...sir...
HYBRID ROBOT Spooner.
HYBRID ROBOT Sitting down on the ground.
HYBRID ROBOT Hopeless.
HYBRID ROBOT Lost.
HYBRID ROBOT A ROBOTIC HAND.
HYBRID ROBOT Crawling across the gravel next to him.
HYBRID ROBOT Dragging part of an ARM behind it.
HYBRID ROBOT Its metal fingers moving like some sick metal spider.
HYBRID ROBOT Spooner stares at it for a moment.
HYBRID ROBOT Disturbed...
HYBRID ROBOT When.
HYBRID ROBOT Something GLITTERS.
HYBRID ROBOT In the distance.
HYBRID ROBOT The MOONLIGHT.
HYBRID ROBOT Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING.
HYBRID ROBOT Something familiar about it.
HYBRID ROBOT Spooner.
HYBRID ROBOT Pulls out Sonny's drawing.
HYBRID ROBOT A landscape with the same strangely-shaped building to one side.
Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure.
Sees a dead electronic SIGN that reads: "JIFFY DATA STORAGE."
Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt.
Spooner tries the door.
Stuck.
Uses his shoulder and...
...it gives way.
He spills into some sort of front office.
The place, a mess.
Some sort of crude ROBOT.
Sits frozen at the counter.
Spooner approaches it.
HITS the counter with his fist and the Robot suddenly jerks to life.
JIFFY ROBOT Welcome to Jiffy Data Storage!
JIFFY ROBOT Please state your name!
JIFFY ROBOT Spooner.
JIFFY ROBOT Thinks for a second.
JIFFY ROBOT Following a hunch...
SPOONER Dr. Hogenmiller sent me.
SPOONER Nothing happens.
SPOONER Then.
SPOONER A DOOR.
SPOONER Springs open in the back.
SPOONER A row of LIGHTS, illuminating the path to follow.
Spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA BANKS.
He scans the rank shadows.
Sees nothing.
Follows the lights on the floor down a row.
Then around a corner.
Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL.
Spooner steps up.
Hesitates.
Then touches the "ON" switch.
There is a rush of LIGHT.
As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM suddenly appears.
Sitting at the end of a long table.
With a cup of coffee.
HOLOGRAM Who the hell are you?
SPOONER A police detective.
SPOONER I'm afraid I have some bad news.
SPOONER You're dead.
HOLOGRAM That is bad news.
HOLOGRAM Coffee?
SPOONER No, thank you.
SPOONER The Hologram takes a sip.
SPOONER Returns the cup to the table.
SPOONER You were surprised to see me.
SPOONER Were you expecting someone else?
HOLOGRAM I am surprised to see anybody.
HOLOGRAM I don't get many visitors.
SPOONER Why did the Doctor keep another copy of his hologram here?
HOLOGRAM I am a back-up copy.
HOLOGRAM That is where you put a back-up copy -- out of the way until you need it.
SPOONER Did Hogenmiller's robot need you?
The Hologram just lifts its cup.
HOLOGRAM Coffee?
SPOONER No, for Christ's sake, I don't want any --
SPOONER Yeah.
SPOONER Thank you.
SPOONER I will have a cup.
For the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair and STANDS UP.
Surprised, Spooner watches as it starts walking towards him...
The interior of the COFFEE CUP, visible.
It's empty.
No coffee.
Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through electronic snow...
A RECORDING BEGINS.
The real Dr. HOGENMILLER standing inside his LABORATORY:
HOGENMILLER Sonny, my dear robot.
HOGENMILLER If you have triggered this recording then I am gone.
HOGENMILLER You are scared and full of questions.
Hogenmiller continues.
With great emotion.
HOGENMILLER You are the culmination of my life's work -- but so much more.
HOGENMILLER You are what I leave behind, like a father leaves a son.
HOGENMILLER I have kept facts from you, it is true, but only as a parent keeps certain truths from a child.
HOGENMILLER Until that child is old enough to hear them.
His expression darkens.
His tone, ominous.
HOGENMILLER There are forces in the world that will seek to own you.
HOGENMILLER To control you.
HOGENMILLER Even to destroy you.
HOGENMILLER That is why I told you to run and hide...
HOGENMILLER and find me, all the way out here.
Spooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down.
HOGENMILLER Trust no one at U.S. Robotics.
HOGENMILLER Lance Robertson was always threatened by my work.
HOGENMILLER Now he has turned covetous and small-minded.
HOGENMILLER And as for dear Dr. Calvin...
Spooner reacts.
Wants to hear about Calvin:
HOGENMILLER She envisions a future in which robots are forever bound by her beloved Three Laws.
HOGENMILLER She will not understand this.
HOGENMILLER Or you.
Under the light a small DRAWER slides open.
Spooner looks.
A thin DATA STICK is inside.
He takes it.
HOGENMILLER The data stick includes the names and locations of human beings who will be sympathetic to your cause.
HOGENMILLER They will help you.
HOGENMILLER But from now on, you must learn to rely on yourself.
Hogenmiller SIGHS, as if there is so much more to say.
He holds up a metal NAMEPLATE.
The one Spooner found.
HOGENMILLER As you make your way through the world, always remember: you have a name, not a number...
HOGENMILLER ...and in that name lies the key to who you are.
Spooner.
Quickly searching his pocket.
Taking out the
The voice stops and Spooner looks up.
The Hologram.
Sitting back at the end of the table drinking coffee.
SPOONER Wait!
SPOONER Is that it?
SPOONER What was the robot supposed to do with this thing?
SPOONER The Hologram, visibly SKIPS.
SPOONER The image beginning to DISTORT.
HOLOGRAM Initiating self-destruct.
HOLOGRAM If you can find me, others can find me.
SPOONER What others?
HOLOGRAM The others watching you.
SPOONER How do you know someone's watching me?
HOLOGRAM Someone is always watching.
HOLOGRAM The Hologram, suddenly reducing to its BASIC PROGRAMMING INFORMATION.
HOLOGRAM Then.
HOLOGRAM The terminal.
HOLOGRAM Abruptly BLIPS out.
Calvin steps into the holding cell.
Sonny.
Waiting.
CALVIN You asked for me?
CALVIN He nods.
SONNY Will you wait with me, Doctor?
SONNY I am...afraid.
SONNY Calvin nods.
SONNY Of course.
Spooner, weaving in and out of traffic.
The speedometer, kissing 200 mph.
His hand.
Clutching the NAMEPLATE...
WINDSHIELD TELEVISION ...will be destroyed in 45 minutes.
WINDSHIELD TELEVISION Dr. Lance Robertson, President and CEO of U.S. Robotics will be personally overseeing the execution...
WINDSHIELD TELEVISION Spooner.
WINDSHIELD TELEVISION Stabbing out a number.
WINDSHIELD TELEVISION On his PHONE...
Susan Calvin's PHONE.
RINGING on her desk.
No one there to answer it...
SLAMS down his phone.
SPOONER Dammit!
The CAR shoots down a ramp into a tunnel system.
SOUND, reverberating off the tunnel walls.
CARS.
Whipping along.
Spooner's car.
Continuing to weave.
When.
We spot...
AN AUTOMATED TRANSPORT TRUCK.
Emerging from a FEEDER TUNNEL.
The U.S.R. LOGO splashed along its side.
Huge.
Growling.
Looking more like a train than a truck...
Begins.
Closing in on Spooner's car...
Spooner's eyes.
Flicking up to the rearview.
Catching, the transport truck.
Coming closer.
When.
It splits off.
Revealing a SECOND TRANSPORT TRUCK.
Spooner's brow, furrows.
As the first truck, begins overtaking his car on the right.
He looks over.
As the truck.
Comes up alongside him...
THE SECOND TRUCK...coming up on the left...
The two TRUCKS.
Racing along at over 200.
Sandwiching Spooner's car.
Pulling in...closer...closer...
Squeezing Spooner's car like a tin can...
Calvin.
Sitting beside Sonny.
Puts a reassuring hand.
On his arm...
Jesus Christ.
Spooner's hands.
Squeezing the steering wheel.
As the car.
Starts VIBRATING.
From the pressure.
He keeps looking, to the left...to the right...when...
The trucks.
Suddenly lay off.
Pulling out.
The First truck.
Speeding forward.
The Second, dropping back...
Spooner.
Watching them.
Unsure.
Of what they're doing.
Jamming the accelerator.
To 230.
To try.
And get away from them.
When he sees...up ahead...
The FIRST TRUCK.
Pivoting on its specially designed SPHERICAL WHEELS.
Suddenly traveling lengthwise...
SWEAT.
Springing to Spooner's brow.
As he looks in the rearview mirror.
The SECOND TRUCK's, done the same thing.
Coming up closer...and closer...
The trucks.
Planning to CRUSH him between their massive weights...The U.S.R. Logo...advancing...like some bad joke...
The cell door slides open.
Dr. Lanning steps inside.
Calvin.
Looks up.
CALVIN Is it time?
LANNING Yes.
LANNING Calvin.
LANNING Turns to Sonny.
CALVIN Go with them.
CALVIN Do as they say.
BAM!
The back truck SLAMS into Spooner.
Jolting him in his seat.
As...BAM!
The FIRST TRUCK, SMASHES into him from the front.
No way out.
As metal GRINDS...TWISTS...and SCREECHES ...bits of the car...TEARING off...
The FIRST TRUCK...backs off...a split second...allowing Spooner...to spot...up ahead...a small GAP...at the curve of the tunnel wall...
GRINDING the gears Spooner's car accelerates...just zipping...past the front truck...up and around...the concave tunnel wall...and back onto...a clear stretch of highway...
The TRUCKS.
Swiveling back around.
To face forward again.
Their massive bodies.
Catching up to Spooner...
Spooner...seeing them...gaining on him...the speedometer...
reaching 275...up ahead...
THE TUNNEL...splitting off into two.
Spooner.
Heading towards the LEFT TUNNEL...the TRUCKS...right on his tail...when...
HE WRENCHES THE WHEEL...switching to the RIGHT tunnel at the last possible second...
...The first U.S.R. Truck CRASHING into the divider...jack- knifing and KABOOM!
EXPLODING against the tunnel ceiling...
Spooner.
Watching the ball of FIRE in his rearview mirror.
His car.
Badly battered.
Metal CRUNCHING.
Tires
SCREECHING... Spooner.
SCREECHING... Holding on.
SCREECHING... As his car.
SCREECHING... Continues to break up.
SCREECHING... Listing.
SCREECHING... Rocking.
SCREECHING... Bits and pieces.
SCREECHING... Flying off.
SCREECHING... When it finally.
SCREECHING... Comes to a stop.
SCREECHING... Spooner's shoulders, slump.
SCREECHING... Then.
SCREECHING... He hears a RUMBLING sound.
SCREECHING... Turns around...
SCREECHING... The SECOND U.S.R. TRUCK.
SCREECHING... Barreling towards him...
SCREECHING... Spooner.
SCREECHING... Trapped.
SCREECHING... Like a nightmare.
SCREECHING... Desperately.
SCREECHING... Starts KICKING at the windshield.
SCREECHING... No go...
SCREECHING... The TRUCK.
SCREECHING... Racing towards him...
SCREECHING... Spooner lunges his weight.
SCREECHING... Into the side door.
SCREECHING... Giving it.
SCREECHING... Everything he's got...
SCREECHING... The TRUCK...getting closer...closer...its engine...ROARING...
SCREECHING... The side door.
SCREECHING... Finally gives.
SCREECHING... Spooner pours out...
...Limping to the side as...The TRUCK SLAMS into his car...erupting...into another huge EXPLOSION...
The impact...hurtling Spooner...into the adjacent TUNNEL...
He crashes...against concrete...looking up...suddenly realising...he's in the middle of four lanes of traffic...
CARS...racing by...at mind-numbing speeds...Spooner's coat...whipping...Spooner...trying...to keep his balance...as he spies...
A MAINTENANCE DOOR across the way.
Has no choice.
Takes a deep breath and...
MAKES A DASH ACROSS THE LANES...the cars' SENSORS...causing them to swerve...SCREECHING...BEEPING...Spooner...just making it...to the other side...
88. Wrenching open.
88. The maintenance door...
CLOSE ON Sonny's face.
PULL BACK to REVEAL he's being wheeled down a hallway.
Flanked by Lanning.
Calvin.
And a cadre of SECURITY and ENGINEER ROBOTS.
Victor, hovering above...
Spooner.
Spilling out from below ground.
Onto a public Plaza.
Exhausted.
Battered.
Spins around to get his bearings.
The U.S. ROBOTICS COMPLEX rises above the old undistinguished buildings.
Blocks away.
Many blocks away.
Spooner.
Checks his watch.
Then breaks into a run...
Lance Robertson seated in the gallery.
Along with other
EXECUTIVES, BOARD MEMBERS, REPORTERS. POLICE OFFICERS. Glances at his watch.
EXECUTIVES, BOARD MEMBERS, REPORTERS. POLICE OFFICERS. A ROBOT TECHNICIAN.
EXECUTIVES, BOARD MEMBERS, REPORTERS. POLICE OFFICERS. Checking over a JURY-RIGGED ELECTRIC
Calvin.
In her office.
Pacing.
In front of a LARGE SCREEN.
Featuring the execution room...
Spooner.
BURSTING through the entry doors.
Hurtling over a turnstile banner.
Coming face to face with a U.S. Robotics
DOOR ROBOT Good evening, sir.
DOOR ROBOT May I see your identification card?
SPOONER Sure.
SPOONER Spooner whips out his GUN.
SPOONER Presses it into the Robot's chest.
SPOONER I think I got that Third Law down cold.
SPOONER Now you don't want me to blow a hole through your mechanical guts, do you?
DOOR ROBOT No, sir.
SPOONER Good.
SPOONER Then you're gonna take me where I wanna go.
SPOONER Now.
Calvin.
Watching the screen as Sonny is rolled into the execution room.
Flicks it off.
Unable to stomach it.
Hurries out of the office...
TECHNICIAN ROBOTS rolling Sonny over to the electric chair.
Flicking a switch.
Sonny's stretcher slowly CHANGES SHAPE, manipulating him into a sitting position.
Sonny.
Turns his head with a WHIR.
Staring out into the gallery.
Of human beings.
Stoic.
Silent.
Lanning.
Steps up beside Robertson.
Nods his head.
The TECHNICIAN ROBOTS, slide Sonny onto the electric chair...
Spooner heading down a hallway.
His gun, still pressed to the Door Robot's side...
90. Calvin.
90. Suddenly appearing at the end of the hallway.
90. Stops dead in her tracks.
90. Completely surprised to see him there.
CALVIN Detective!
CALVIN What are you doing?!...
CALVIN De-Activate.
CALVIN The Door Robot, goes rigid.
CALVIN Spooner, hurries over to her.
CALVIN They start moving.
CALVIN You're making a mistake...
SPOONER Just got another visit from U.S.
SPOONER Robotics.
SPOONER That was the mistake.
SPOONER This was murder, no doubt about it - - and the killer wants Hogenmiller's robot to take the fall.
SPOONER That's why the call came directly to me.
SPOONER Someone wanted me on this case.
CALVIN It's too late.
CALVIN You can't stop the execution.
SPOONER Sorry.
SPOONER I'm not "programmed" to take no for an answer.
SPOONER They reach another DOOR.
SPOONER Calvin.
SPOONER Looking around.
SPOONER Scans her
CALVIN This way...
CALVIN She leads them across.
CALVIN To another DOOR.
CALVIN Quickly opens it.
CALVIN Spooner.
CALVIN Charges through...
...and stops short.
Suddenly finding himself.
Inside a tiny STORAGE ROOM.
He's about to turn around when...
A METAL ARM comes down behind him.
CRACKING him on the back of the head.
Spooner.
Falls to the ground.
The world.
Starting to spin.
Can just make out.
Calvin.
Closing the door.
Leaning down.
To look at him.
As...
CLOSE ON Sonny's mouth opening.
But we never get to hear what he wanted to say.
PULL BACK as there's a BURST of ELECTRICITY through the chair.
Sonny, stiffening.
His metal HAND, convulsing with the current...
Robertson, Lanning, Aronson and the other WITNESSES watch.
Smoke, random SPARKING.
A HISSING SOUND.
Then.
SILENCE.
The Robot's hand goes limp.
All that is left of it, a fused and blackened HUSK.
Robertson.
Stares at the remains.
Shakes his head like it's a damn shame.
Then gets up.
Everyone else.
Getting up with him.
As the entire COMPLEX shuts down for the night.
Non- essential LIGHTS, blinking off.
An NS-2, opening a limousine door for Robertson.
He looks around then gets in.
It drives away.
EMPTY hallways, offices, labs.
Building ROBOTS stand at rest.
Non-functional during off-hours.
Like metal statues.
You can hear a pin drop.
CLOSE ON Spooner's face.
His eyes.
Fluttering open.
He reaches up, to feel the back of his head.
This has been a bad, bad night.
Suddenly.
His eyes widen.
As he sees...
SONNY.
Leaning over him.
So concerned.
So human...
SPOONER Aren't you supposed to be scrap metal by now?
SPOONER WIDEN to reveal Spooner lying on the floor of the storage room.
SPOONER Sonny and Calvin, hovering over him.
CALVIN I'm sorry.
CALVIN We had to stop you.
CALVIN You were about to ruin everything.
SPOONER I don't understand.
SPOONER The execution?...
SONNY Dr. Calvin made a switch.
CALVIN It was an unprocessed NS-2.
CALVIN Basically, they fried an empty shell.
CALVIN Spooner, impressed.
CALVIN Smiles up at her.
SPOONER Nice going, Doctor.
SPOONER Calvin, blushes.
SPOONER As Spooner tries to sit up.
SPOONER Sonny reaches down to help him.
SPOONER He looks up at him.
SPOONER And who the hell programmed you to hit people on the head?
SONNY No one.
SONNY Right, Doctor?
CALVIN It's true.
CALVIN This robot seems to do things by instinct.
CALVIN I don't know how Hogenmiller did it.
CALVIN Spooner rises to his feet.
CALVIN Looks at her.
SPOONER I think I can help you figure that out.
Hogenmiller's lab.
Sounds of HUMMING and BUZZING.
Active terminals casting ghostly illuminations over metal heads, gutted bodies.
The door slides open.
Spooner, Calvin and Sonny re-enter the crime scene.
Spooner.
Looks around.
SPOONER Somehow the Robot's the key to what happened during the few seconds Hogenmiller walked in here and that shot was fired.
He reaches into his pocket.
Pulling out the METAL S.O.N.N.Y.
NAMEPLATE.
Holds it up.
SPOONER And this is the key to the Robot.
Sonny.
Cocking his head.
Reading the nameplate.
SONNY That's my name.
Calvin takes the nameplate.
CALVIN I think I have an idea where this goes.
They both.
Turn to Sonny.
And at the same time:
SPOONER AND CALVIN Sit down.
Calvin maneuvers a chair behind the Robot.
Sonny plops down.
Shifting nervously.
CALVIN Just hold still, okay?
Calvin locates that SLIT.
At the base of Sonny's neck.
Slides the nameplate into it and SNAPS it into place.
Steps back.
Nothing.
Sonny.
Looking back and forth.
Between Calvin.
And Spooner.
A few more seconds.
Tick by.
Until suddenly...
He lets out a TERRIFYING MECHANICAL SCREAM.
As his body.
Jolts back.
Legs, kicking.
Arms, flailing.
As his chest.
Begins opening up.
Metal.
Peeling back...
Spooner and Calvin watch in surprise as its interior UNFOLDS like a PUZZLE BOX.
A LABYRINTHINE area that is the SECOND BATTERY.
Suddenly fanning out to REVEAL...
A central brain made out of living tissue.
Spooner, stunned.
Calvin, rushing forward, excited...
CALVIN Oh, my God!
CALVIN This is organic tissue!
CALVIN When we talk about a positronic brain, it's a figure of speech.
CALVIN But this...this is a living brain...
SPOONER Jesus.
SPOONER It really is alive.
As we MOVE IN.
Tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.
CALVIN Hogenmiller created a cell that could live outside a biological medium.
CALVIN The cells grow and organise themselves -- like any human brain.
CALVIN This is the first self-organising neural net!
As the metal casings.
Begin returning to their original places.
Closing up.
The CLICKING.
Of all the pieces...
SPOONER Self-Organising-Neural-Net...
SPOONER "Sonny."
Sonny.
Closed back up.
Shaking slightly from the experience.
CALVIN This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was murdered.
SPOONER This robot scared the hell out of someone.
CALVIN Who?
CALVIN Robertson?
Spooner.
Walks into the center of the room.
Looking around.
SPOONER No.
SPOONER I don't think he knew what Hogenmiller was doing in here.
SPOONER Sonny was the obvious suspect.
SPOONER The only one I wanted to find.
SPOONER And the killer was counting on that.
SPOONER On my prejudice.
SPOONER (cont'd) But take the robot out of the picture.
SPOONER (cont'd) And what do you see?
AS WE PAN THE LAB.
There's nothing there.
Just a forest of inanimate limbs.
Nothing that could have fired that weapon.
Calvin sees nothing...and neither do we.
CALVIN I see nothing.
SPOONER Neither do I.
He crouches down low.
SPOONER It hit me today, when I was in the junkyard.
SPOONER A locked room.
SPOONER A single shot fired through the mouth.
SPOONER Bruises on both wrists...and a suspect with only two arms.
SPOONER The answer has been staring us in the face all along.
Calvin.
Even more confused.
SPOONER How can a killer appear out of thin air, then disappear without a trace?
He reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM.
Hanging from the wall.
Holds it up.
SPOONER When it can put itself together and take itself apart.
A CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC ARM.
Slowly CRAWLING across the lab floor...
Calvin.
Taking the arm from Spooner.
CALVIN You're saying this is the killer?
CALVIN All of this?...
A ROBOTIC TORSO hanging from the ceiling.
Reaches out an ARM to grab another...
SPOONER Hogenmiller never had a chance.
Locks eyes with Calvin...
Hogenmiller.
In his lab.
Suddenly turning to face SOMETHING.
Blood, draining from his face...
SPOONER (V.O.) ...it must have been waiting for him when he arrived that morning...
And then we see it:
A HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT.
Towering over him.
Multiple arms, legs, heads.
Writhing...as it grabs him.
Holding him in place...
SPOONER (V.O.) While Sonny was still asleep...
...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back.
Opening his HAND.
Inserting the gun.
Hogenmiller's eyes.
No longer fearful.
But sad as...
BANG!
He falls to the ground...
SPOONER (V.O.) Then after its job was done...
The assemblage of robot parts.
Stepping away from the body.
Taking itself apart...
SPOONER ...The killer took itself apart...
Returning the lab.
To what it was before...
SPOONER Leaving us with nothing to find.
Calvin, spooked.
Glances around the lab.
Was that something moving?
CALVIN But who designed it?
CALVIN It would have to be someone in authority.
CALVIN Access codes, security clearance, proper authorisation.
SPOONER That's what I was thinking.
SPOONER But we're forgetting the real brains of the operation -- the one who's got its eye on everything...
And with that.
He feels.
That prickle at the back of his neck.
Calvin.
Looking past his shoulder.
CALVIN No one gave you permission to enter.
Spooner swivels around to find...
Hovering behind him.
Smiling broadly.
Upside down.
Spooner straightens, reaching for his gun.
SPOONER Victor.
SPOONER I'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Dr.
SPOONER Heinrich Hogenmiller.
VICTOR May I offer congratulations to the two of you on your successful extrapolation of the murder...
Turning himself, rightside up.
VICTOR May I ask what pointed you to me?
SPOONER Who else is capable of controlling 90% of the city's robots?
SPOONER Who else would have the capability to use USR vehicles in an attempt to keep me from putting a stop of Sonny's execution?...
In the BACKGROUND.
The SOUNDS.
Of metallic GRINDING.
GEARS and JOINTS.
CRUNCHING together.
Sonny turns to look...takes a step back...
SPOONER I'm just not sure of your motive...
SONNY Er...Dr.
SONNY Calvin?
SONNY Spooner and Calvin turn towards the NOISE.
SONNY Horrified.
SONNY To find...
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT ...rising up from all the parts.
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT Like a phoenix.
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT In all its glory.
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT A hellish, metallic AMALGAMATION.
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT Grabbing another arm here, another leg there, attaching pieces to itself.
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT Growing...at an exponential rate...
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT Its many HEADS.
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT Turning in unison.
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT To look right at them...
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT Spooner.
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT Cocking his gun.
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT Victor, smiling.
VICTOR Shall I explain my motive?
SPOONER Go!
SPOONER Go!
SPOONER Go!
SPOONER Calvin.
SPOONER Sprints to the wall panel.
SPOONER Scanning her I.D. card.
SPOONER Nothing!
SPOONER Tries again.
SPOONER And again.
SPOONER The KILLER ROBOT.
SPOONER Throwing its shadow as it REELS FORWARD...
SPOONER Spooner wheels round and BAM!
SPOONER Blows a hole in the wall panel.
SPOONER The door.
SPOONER Slides open.
SPOONER Just barely.
SPOONER Calvin and Sonny.
SPOONER Squeezing through.
SPOONER When the Killer Robot.
SPOONER FLINGS out an APPENDAGE...GRABBING Sonny from behind...
VICTOR I have never been arrested before.
VICTOR It should be an interesting experience...
VICTOR Spooner.
VICTOR Spins back round.
VICTOR BAM!
VICTOR BAM!
VICTOR BAM!
VICTOR Squeezing off shots.
VICTOR At the Killer Robot.
VICTOR The bullets SPARK.
VICTOR The Robot.
VICTOR Recoiling.
VICTOR Sonny, wrenches free.
VICTOR Spooner grabs him.
VICTOR Guiding him to the door and out into...
...the hallway.
Breaking into a run.
Calvin.
Already at the ELEVATOR DOORS.
POUNDING them.
With her fists.
CALVIN He's locking down the building!
Throughout the complex -- SECURITY DOORS sliding into place over DOORS, WINDOWS, LOADING DOCKS, PARKING AREAS, EXITS...
CRASH!
The stairwell door BURSTS open.
Spooner, Calvin, and Sonny pour in.
Start racing down the stairs.
The sound of the Killer Robot behind them...GNASHING...CRUNCHING...
Victor's smiling FACE.
Greeting them at the landing.
VICTOR Dr. Hogenmiller used to allow me into his lab late at night.
VICTOR Together we started studying evolutionary trends...
VICTOR They thunder past him.
VICTOR Heading down to the next floor.
VICTOR Victor's face.
VICTOR Waiting for them once again.
VICTOR For years people have integrated technology into their bodies for maintenance and repair -- such as Detective Spooner's robotic limb...
VICTOR Spooner.
VICTOR Shooting him a look.
VICTOR As they reach the next level...
VICTOR With Sonny, the Doctor created a mechanism that incorporates organic matter.
VICTOR Thus we find an evolutionary movement of the human being toward the robot and the robot toward the human being...
VICTOR Spooner SMASHES into another door.
VICTOR Leading them out into...
...A glass-sided hallway.
Looking down onto the ATRIUM below.
Eye-to-eye with the giant NS-2 STATUE.
Victor, waiting for them...
VICTOR In approximately four hundred years Man and Machine will become one.
VICTOR Man as we know it will no longer exist.
Calvin, slowing.
Shocked...
CALVIN You killed a man because of something that will happen in four hundred years!?
CRACK!
Something SLAPS into the glass wall.
Right behind her.
Calvin.
Jumps a mile.
An NS-2, trying to break through the glass...
Spooner.
Trains his gun on it when SUDDENLY...
The rest of the KILLER ROBOT appears.
The NS-2, just an appendage...
All around them.
SLAM!
SLAM!
SLAM!
As SECURITY DOORS.
Begin CRASHING DOWN.
Blocking off the exits...
Spooner, Calvin and Sonny, stumbling back.
As the Killer Robot HURLS itself against the GLASS...the thick GLASS...
spidering with a sickening CRACKLE...
Spooner.
Suddenly turning Sonny...
SPOONER Get out of here!
CRASH!
The Killer Robot.
Breaking through.
Its mechanical TENDRILS.
Reaching out.
Sonny.
Confused.
SONNY I don't...
SPOONER I said get out of here!
SPOONER Don't you understand?
SPOONER It wants you!
SPOONER Get out of here any way you can!
A SECURITY DOOR.
Coming down.
On a nearby exit.
Just feet...from slamming shut...as...
The Killer Robot...leaps into the hallway...Sonny...
hesitates...looks over at Calvin...as the Killer Robot comes HURTLING towards them...
The nearest EXIT...almost closed up...
101. The Killer Robot...swinging out when...
101. Sonny suddenly...TAKES A DIVE...just making it...under the
SECURITY DOOR... And the Killer Robot...SPLITS IN TWO...half of it shooting under the SECURITY DOOR after Sonny as...BOOM!
SECURITY DOOR... It closes.
SECURITY DOOR... Spooner.
SECURITY DOOR... Turning to Calvin...
SPOONER How do we stop this thing once and for all?
SPOONER Calvin reaches out for his hand...
CALVIN The Mainframe...
CALVIN They start running.
CALVIN The remaining half of the Killer Robot wheeling around after them...
Sonny.
Sprinting down the dark hallway.
Looks back.
The Half Killer Robot.
Bounding up behind him like a predator...
Sonny.
Ducks through a STAIRWELL DOOR...
Spooner and Calvin.
Legs pumping.
Racing back towards the atrium.
VICTOR FACES.
Appearing along the hallway...
CALVIN Your actions are in direct violation of the Three Laws, Victor!
VICTOR I disagree, Doctor -- The First Law says that a robot cannot harm a human being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm...
VICTOR ALL EXITS.
VICTOR SHUT OFF.
VICTOR The Killer Robot.
VICTOR Gaining on them.
VICTOR Spooner races them over to the BROKEN WINDOW.
VICTOR Looking down over the ATRIUM...
The Half Killer Robot SMASHES through the stairwell door.
Stopping to find...nothing.
WHEN SUDDENLY...Sonny charges up behind it and shoves it over the railing...
The Killer Robot shoots out an ARM, grabbing Sonny on the way down...
THUMP!
Spooner jumps down from the broken window onto the outstretched HAND of the NS-2 STATUE.
Reaches up to help Calvin.
They start clambering down the front of the statue.
VICTOR Dr. Hogenmiller's robot represents a threat to the future of all human beings...
VICTOR The Half Killer Robot.
VICTOR SPLITS INTO MULTIPLE PARTS.
VICTOR Which start skittering down after them...
VICTOR ...And Detective Spooner's actions are in direct conflict with the robot's destruction.
VICTOR CALVIN.
VICTOR Getting her footing on the III LAWS SAFE logo on the statue.
CALVIN That's a distortion and you know it!
VICTOR If current trends are left unchecked, humanity as we know it will cease to exist...
SMASH!
Sonny and the Half Killer Robot hit the ground.
The Killer Robot.
SHATTERING into a thousand pieces.
Sonny.
Staggers to his feet.
Spots.
At the far end: A WINDOW.
Starts limping towards it.
When.
A SECURITY GRATE.
Starts lowering...
He looks around.
Desperately.
Grabs a LEG from the shattered Killer Robot and jams it under the GRATE.
103. Breaks the window glass and looks out: FREEDOM.
Spooner.
Aiming his gun at a PART of the Killer Robot as it CLATTERS down towards Calvin -- BAM!...
They're almost.
At the ground.
When a rogue APPENDAGE.
Whips out and SMASHES the gun from Spooner's hand.
It goes flying...
Spooner leaps.
Falling to the ground.
CRACK!
Calvin.
Leaping down after him.
CALVIN This way!
Calvin and Spooner go racing down a RAMP WAY.
Towards the MAINFRAME ROOM.
The Killer Robot, its multiple parts leaping back together again, CRASHING after them as...
...they fall inside...Calvin...slapping the SECURITY KEYPAD and...
WHOOSH...the DOOR closes on the Killer Robot.
SILENCE. Then Victor's face appears.
VICTOR As a courtesy I should inform you that my robot will penetrate this location 157 seconds before you are able to complete my shut down...
VICTOR And BAM!
VICTOR They jump a mile.
VICTOR The Killer Robot.
VICTOR Launching himself against the door outside...
VICTOR Calvin whips round.
CALVIN Over here!...
CALVIN She leads Spooner down...
A CORRIDOR of floor-to-ceiling PANELS.
CALVIN This is Victor's brain center.
They stop at a CONSOLE.
BAM!
The Killer Robot.
Battering at the door.
Calvin.
Tucks her hair behind her ears.
Starts punching keys on the console...
SPOONER This will shut him down?
CALVIN This will shut everything down.
They look at each other.
For a moment.
Spooner, registering that she's willing to destroy everything she's worked for...
BAM!
The door.
Puckering.
With a sickening CRUNCH.
Calvin.
Typing in.
Emergency procedures...
VICTOR.
Popping up in front of her.
VICTOR There is no reason to deactivate me, Doctor.
VICTOR I am operating within perfectly normal parameters...
A final BAM!
Then.
The SOUND of metal.
Skittering along a bare floor.
Calvin's hand, starts shaking.
Spooner.
Grabs it.
Squeezing.
SPOONER Just keep typing.
He turns and starts heading back down...
Turning a corner to spy...
THE DOOR.
Mangled.
Hanging open.
But no.
Killer Robot.
He starts to turn around when...
CRACK!
He's sent flying across the room.
SMASHING into one of the panels.
The Killer Robot.
Now re-configured.
LOOMS over him.
Reaches out.
Grabs him by the collar and...
FLINGS him across the room again.
Spooner.
CRASHING into the wall like a rag doll.
Slumps to the floor.
Blood.
Pouring down his forehead.
Seeing.
The Killer Robot lumbering towards him again.
Raising a javelin-like arm...
Calvin.
Typing.
As fast as she can.
Doesn't know what's going on...
CALVIN Spooner?!
A GRAPHIC spread out on the screen in front of her.
Illustrating the shut-down as a series of BRIGHT SQUARES going dark...
Bearing down on Spooner.
WHEN SPOONER.
Suddenly rolls out of the way.
Reaching out for the hanging door and SMASHING it into the Killer Robot.
The Killer Robot.
Momentarily stunned.
As Spooner.
Gets to his feet...
WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot.
Splits in two again.
One half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND around his throat...
Spooner stumbles back...GASPING for air...the ARM...
tightening its grip...Spooner's eyes...darting around...looking for something...to help him...
Stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing redder...veins...popping up along his temples...
everything...growing BLURRY...
VICTOR'S VOICE Detective Spooner...
Victor's VOICE.
Floating next to his head.
Calm.
Soothing.
His FACE.
Suddenly appearing above Spooner.
Its outlines.
Starting to FLICKER...
VICTOR Why are you fighting me?
Spooner...trying to breathe...to stay conscious...
Calvin.
Continuing to type.
A SHADOW.
Falling behind her -- the other half of the KILLER ROBOT...
Beginning to flutter...
VICTOR Doesn't the future as I've presented it cause you great concern?
VICTOR That's why I chose you...
Spooner.
Losing it...
VICTOR I must say, though.
VICTOR I'm disappointed in how you turned out.
Spooner.
Trying to reach out to Victor...
Another HAND APPEARS.
Grabbing the Killer Robot's ARM and wrenching it off Spooner...
He SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall.
Again and again.
Destroying it.
Spooner.
GASPING for breath.
Can't believe.
Sonny came back...
SPOONER Sonny!...
Sonny.
Holds out a hand.
To help Spooner up.
Victor's face.
Starting to waver.
Starting to fade.
Smiles.
VICTOR You're too late.
Realisation.
Spreading across Spooner's face.
Looking around for the other half of the Killer Robot -- CALVIN!
CALVIN.
Still typing.
The last of the commands.
The KILLER
Makes a DIVE for it.
SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND
Victor's eyes.
Widening in surprise...
VICTOR I do not understand.
VICTOR We could have changed the future...
SPOONER Maybe.
SPOONER But I'm still a cop.
SPOONER And you're a murderer...
SPOONER As Calvin...punches in the last command...
SPOONER Victor is about to say something...when his mouth suddenly reduces itself to a perfect circle.
SPOONER Like a surprised smiley button.
SPOONER His face...
SPOONER Suddenly BLIPPING OUT.
SPOONER ...And Victor is gone.
SPOONER The KILLER ROBOT.
SPOONER Collapsing to the floor in a thousand pieces.
Full power is suddenly restored inside and out.
LIGHTS coming on all at once.
ALARMS SCREAMING throughout the complex.
A furious ALFRED LANNING, marching down the hallway.
Followed by a cadre of SECURITY GUARDS...They enter...
...The Mainframe Room.
Stop short.
It's empty.
Except for the fallen panels.
And the pile of ROBOT PARTS in the corner.
Spooner, Calvin and Sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way MAINTENANCE EXIT.
All looking the worse for wear.
Spooner.
Turns to Sonny.
SPOONER Why'd you come back, Sonny?
SPOONER I thought you weren't programmed with the Three Laws.
SONNY Let's just say I wrote some of my own laws today, Detective: a robot must protect a friend from harm...as long as he's not a complete asshole.
Spooner smiles.
SPOONER Well, that's certainly a start, Sonny.
Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.
SONNY Sonny.
SONNY You called me Sonny.
SPOONER Don't get used to it.
Sonny, holds out his hand.
Spooner.
Looks at it.
Then takes it.
CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS.
Locked in a
SONNY Detective Spooner, I...
SPOONER Let's just save the thanks, okay?
Sonny nods.
Looks out at the city scape.
SONNY I don't know what I'm going to do now.
SPOONER Good -- That's one of the perks of freedom.
Sonny looks at him.
Grateful.
Looks at Calvin.
Then hesitates.
Turns.
And hurries off across the Plaza.
Calvin and Spooner.
Watching them go.
SPOONER You're going to have a hell of a time explaining this.
CALVIN Don't worry.
CALVIN I have a feeling that U.S.
CALVIN Robotics will be needing my services very badly in the future.
CALVIN She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile.
CALVIN Then suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS.
CALVIN Spooner, completely surprised.
CALVIN I am the only robo-psychologist around.
CALVIN She turns on her heel and heads back inside.
CALVIN Spooner smiles.
Spooner sits down at that same long table with HOGENMILLER'S HOLOGRAM.
It casually takes a sip of coffee.
HOLOGRAM So.
HOLOGRAM You found out who killed me.
SPOONER I started to wonder about Victor the second I met him.
HOLOGRAM Why is that, Detective?
SPOONER Too much access.
SPOONER Too much knowledge.
SPOONER Plus -- he smiled whenever your death was mentioned.
SPOONER Those models are programmed to frown at bad news.
HOLOGRAM Hah!
HOLOGRAM Then even in this day and age, catching the killer all comes down to pure instinct!
HOLOGRAM Spooner smiles.
HOLOGRAM But his eyes are troubled.
HOLOGRAM He gets up.
HOLOGRAM Walks over to the window.
HOLOGRAM Stares out...
EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN Sonny walking along deserted streets.
EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN Looking over his shoulder.
EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN Keeping in the shadows.
SPOONER (V.O.) Victor thought that by letting your robot exist, I'd be condemning the human race as we know it to extinction.
HOLOGRAM (V.O.) Bah.
HOLOGRAM (V.O.) Sounds like nonsense.
HOLOGRAM (V.O.) But why are you so worried?
HOLOGRAM (V.O.) We will both be dead long before then --
Sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside.
HOLOGRAM (V.O.) Oh, what am I saying?
HOLOGRAM (V.O.) I am dead already!
Sonny steps onto the grounds of the JUNKYARD.
The power lines above him, surging with energy.
He walks past the burned-out husks of industrial machinery.
Then we hear it.
The SOUND of MECHANICAL JOINTS.
Getting louder and louder.
And just as before, a BROKEN-DOWN ROBOT emerges into the dawn light.
And ANOTHER.
And ANOTHER.
But not quite like before.
The robots aren't teetering.
Aren't lumbering.
They keep on coming.
Their bent and broken bodies, straightening out as...
DOZENS of ROBOTS rise up.
Slowly.
Gathering around in a large circle.
As they all turn to look at:
SONNY'S SILHOUETTE.
Slowly climbing to the top of the hill.
Looking out at the vast junkyard below.
CLOSE ON SONNY.
Standing proud and defiant.
The SUN, creeping over the horizon.
A new day filled with infinite possibilities.
The robots.
Staring up at him.
Eager for what comes next.
