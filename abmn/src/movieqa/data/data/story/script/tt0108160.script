A card: Chicago.
He's in his thirties.
His neck is pinched into a crisp
dress shirt and tie.
His expression is vacant, faraway.
A breeze blows but he doesn't react to it.
In the
distance the architecture of the Chicago skyline.
Mommy got sick and it happened
just like that and there was
nothing anybody would do.
And pull back to reveal:
Next to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9.
Sam's hand is on
his shoulder.
As the mourners go past and each takes a
turn shoveling a clod of dirt into an open grave --
SAM If we start asking why we'll go
SAM crazy.
SAM So, rule number one.
SAM We don't ask why.
Pretty, blonde, animated.
Jeans, a T-shirt, a Baltimore
Orioles hat.
ANNIE Why?
ANNIE I just want to know why?
ANNIE That's my first rule.
ANNIE I always
ANNIE ask why.
ANNIE Come on.
ANNIE Tell me.
ANNIE C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
And pull back to reveal:
Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy
named SETH.
They're carrying packing boxes into the
house they share in the Old Town section of Chicago.
The same stunning architecture in the b.g.
They go up
the back wooden staircase to the house.
SETH There's no why, Annie.
SETH I'm
SETH just not up for it.
SETH I never
SETH said I was.
ANNIE Is there somebody else?
SETH Nope.
ANNIE You don't love me, is that it?
SETH Nope.
Follow them into:
As they set down the packing boxes and Seth starts to
assemble them.
ANNIE How about ...
ANNIE you're too
ANNIE narcissistic to commit to
ANNIE another human being in a long-
ANNIE term way.
SETH That's good.
An attractive, thirtyish couple, SUZY and GREG are
stocking Sam's freezer with enough Ziploc meals for a
months.
A number of friends and relatives talk quietly
in the living room beyond.
Sam stands alone by a window
that looks into the backyard.
We can see a garden of
flowers -- clearly planted by Sam's wife.
SUZY Five minutes in the microwave.
SUZY Any one of them, five minutes
SUZY and done.
SUZY Ready to eat.
SUZY Do
SUZY you know how to make juice?
SAM Microwave.
SAM Five minutes.
Packing boxes.
Seth is moving out.
ANNIE You take the microwave?
SETH What am I going to do with a
SETH microwave?
ANNIE You turn it on, you open it and
ANNIE you stand in front of it for a
ANNIE very long time.
SETH So you're angry.
SETH Big deal.
A large modern architectural firm in a Chicago high-
rise.
Lake Michigan out the window.
A large space with
several architects consulting, drafting, etc.
Sam is at
his desk, working.
An older colleague, ROB, comes over
to him.
Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind
but a little stuffy.
ROB Young man, it's none of my
ROB business, but maybe you should
ROB talk to someone.
ROB I myself
ROB have consulted a professional.
ROB I used to be up tight.
On Sam's face.
It's hard to imagine Rob being any more
uptight than he is.
Sam takes some business cards out
of his shirt pocket and reads them off.
SAM Hypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage...
SAM Loss of Spouse support groups...
SAM Single parent discussion nights...
SAM Parents without partners.
SAM Partners without parents.
SAM People who need people.
SAM Guys
SAM who go into the woods, beat
SAM drums and bond.
SAM Get a shrink.
SAM Hug a friend.
SAM Hug yourself.
He stops, realizing that everyone in the room is staring
at him.
Quickly they pretend they weren't paying
attention.
Someone whispers something to a client.
SAM Don't mind him.
SAM He's the guy
SAM who just lost his wife.
SAM What I really think is we need
SAM a change.
ROB Good idea.
ROB Take a few weeks
ROB off, get some sun, take Jonah
ROB fishing --
SAM A real change.
SAM New city.
SAM Someplace where every time I go
SAM around a corner I don't think
SAM of Maggie.
And hold on Sam for a moment and--
Sam, Jonah and Maggie walking toward the field.
It's a
gorgeous day for a game.
They high-five each other.
ROB (V.O.) Where you going to go?
And cut back to:
As Sam snaps out of it.
SAM I was thinking about Seattle.
The Living Section of the paper.
Annie is blowing her
nose as she finishes telling her tale of woe to her
boss, LAURIE JOHNSON.
LAURIE Honey, he wasn't right for you.
ANNIE I know.
LAURIE He wasn't even wrong for you,
LAURIE like cosmically wrong, so don't
LAURIE beat up on yourself for
LAURIE wasting...however long it was.
ANNIE I know.
ANNIE (blowing her nose
ANNIE again)
She pours Annie a cup of hot water.
Annie pulls a
teabag out of her pocket, puts it into the water.
LAURIE Maybe you should see a shrink.
ANNIE I want my money.
LAURIE Go home for the weekend.
ANNIE That's what I'm going to do.
ANNIE I'm going to go home.
ANNIE I quit.
ANNIE Laurie, I quit.
ANNIE I'm
ANNIE going back to Baltimore.
ANNIE How does a blonde do a high-
ANNIE five?
She smacks herself in the head.
The X where walkway K crosses with walkway L. Coming
down walkway K are Sam, Jonah, Suzy, Greg, their son
MACK, and several other friends.
And coming down walkway L is Annie with Laurie and a
couple of FRIENDS from the paper, JUDITH and DIANE.
They pass each other going in diagonal directions and
continue on.
We stay with Sam's group:
JONAH Dad says I'm going to get used
JONAH to it, but I don't think you
JONAH can ever get used to a
JONAH designated hitter.
overlap:
SUZY Eventually, in a few months,
SUZY you'll start seeing women,
SUZY you'll meet someone.
SAM Move on.
SAM Right.
SAM That's what
SAM I'm going to do.
SAM In a few
SAM months, boom, I'll be fine,
SAM I'll just grow a new heart.
SUZY I'm sorry --
GREG Sam, she didn't mean --
Sam is shaking his head no as they reach the gate for
the Seattle plane.
SAM I know, I know.
SAM Look, it doesn't happen twice.
Annie's group, as they approach the gate for the
Baltimore plane.
ANNIE I'm going to meet someone,
ANNIE someone nice and stable who
ANNIE wears a hat so he won't catch a
ANNIE cold, and I'm going to marry
ANNIE him and have three children
ANNIE and live happily ever after.
ANNIE I mean, I am not cut out for this
DIANE For what?
ANNIE For life as we know it.
LAURIE Just make sure he isn't fat
LAURIE like my Michael or you'll spend
LAURIE your whole life worrying he's
LAURIE going to drop dead.
JUDITH God, you guys are so romantic.
ANNIE Do you know how long romance
ANNIE lasts?
ANNIE That long.
DIANE Steven still brings me flowers
DIANE every Friday and we've been
DIANE married 10 years.
LAURIE Honey, nobody wants to hear
LAURIE that.
LAURIE Here, darling, have some Tic
LAURIE Tacs.
Kissing everyone.
Annie starts toward the plane, loaded
with stuff.
ANNIE The next time you see me I am
ANNIE going to be incredibly happy.
Sam and Jonah sitting together as the plane waits on the
runway.
He notices his father's distractedness, reaches
over and takes his hand.
Sam comes back into focus.
SAM I'm your dad.
SAM Don't ever
SAM forget that.
SAM That's rule
SAM number two.
SAM It's you and me, kid.
Annie sitting by herself as the plane waits on the
runway.
ANNIE I guess it's just us.
She gulps.
The two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for
instructions.
And now they both start to take off.
In opposite
directions.
And we pull back back back back as the planes take off,
one flying east, the other flying west.
And further and further back as they soar into the air
and leave the frame.
The night sky.
Stars twinkle.
And now tilt down to see the United States.
It looks
like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by
Saul Steinberg.
A light goes on in Baltimore.
A light goes on in Seattle.
They are the only lights on the map.
As Annie comes out of the newspaper building with WALTER
JACKSON, a tall, handsome man who wears a hat.
They're
carrying an armful of Christmas presents.
They're
walking toward the parking lot.
WALTER The short one with black hair
WALTER is your cousin Irene --
ANNIE -- who's married to --
WALTER Harold, who ran away with his
WALTER secretary but came back --
ANNIE -- because Irene threatened to
ANNIE put the dog to sleep if he
ANNIE didn't --
WALTER And your brother Tom is a
WALTER psychology professor and is
WALTER married to...Betsy --
ANNIE -- who is the most competitive
ANNIE woman in the world --
They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and
pull out together.
Christmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in
front of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park
their cars.
They get out assembling presents.
WALTER Your Uncle Milton lost all his
WALTER money in a Puerto Rican
WALTER condominium that went belly up,
WALTER don't mention the IRS or the
WALTER Federal prison system.
WALTER Your
WALTER mother is Barbara, your father
WALTER is Cliff --
ANNIE I hope he doesn't get out his
ANNIE slides.
WALTER Am I what they had in mind?
ANNIE They're going to love you.
As they start toward the house.
BARBARA Everybody!
BARBARA Annie has an announcement --
ANNIE Walter and I are engaged!
And the family's at the diner table.
Annie's family is
a completely normally-looking WASP family -- only
everyone is a little eccentric.
Annie's mother BARBARA,
a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman,
claps her hands together.
Her father CLIFF, who's at
the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss.
Annie's brother TOM and his wife BETSY are at the table,
along with cousin IRENE and her husband HAROLD.
UNCLE
MILTON, who's Irene's father and Barbara's brother.
There are about FIVE CHILDREN there, too.
IRENE That's wonderful, Annie.
IRENE hope it lasts...
IRENE for years
IRENE and years.
BETSY Do you have a ring?
ANNIE No.
ANNIE Not yet.
BETSY Oh.
BETSY Well.
BETSY How will anyone
BETSY know?
TOM Because you're going to call
TOM them all and tell them.
TOM Congratulations, Walter.
He claps Walter on the back.
Walter sneezes.
And sneezes again.
CLIFF Are you all right?
WALTER It's nothing.
WALTER Nothing.
ANNIE It's probably just the flowers --
BARBARA We'll move them --
WALTER Don't touch them.
WALTER I feel
WALTER terrible sneezing at a time
WALTER like this.
WALTER This is a big
WALTER moment for me --
ANNIE He's allergic to everything,
ANNIE don't worry about it --
HAROLD Bees.
HAROLD I'm allergic to bees.
CLIFF Not salmon I hope --
ANNIE If he eats one tiny piece of a
ANNIE nut --
WALTER My head swells up like a
WALTER watermelon and I drop dead.
IRENE It's the same with Harold and
IRENE bees.
CLIFF Your mother and I had salmon at
CLIFF our wedding, and I really think
CLIFF a wedding without cold salmon --
WALTER I'm not allergic to salmon.
WALTER don't think.
WALTER But you never
WALTER know.
HAROLD You never know.
BARBARA Oh, honey, I feel terrible, we
BARBARA used up this magnum of
BARBARA champagne we were saving on
BARBARA something else, what did we use
BARBARA it for?
TOM Uncle Milton's parole --
BARBARA Right.
UNCLE MILTON And it was delicious.
BARBARA It was, wasn't it, Milton
BARBARA darling --
BETSY When are you getting married,
BETSY Annie?
CLIFF In early June.
CLIFF In the garden.
HAROLD Does it have to be in the garden?
IRENE What about Harold and bees?
BARBARA We'll spray you.
CLIFF Cold salmon.
CLIFF A lovely cucumber
CLIFF salad.
CLIFF Strawberries.
WALTER I'm afraid I'm allergic to
WALTER strawberries.
CLIFF No strawberries.
Annie smiles at Walter.
ANNIE Is that all right with you?
WALTER Today I consider myself the
WALTER luckiest man on the face of
WALTER the earth.
IRENE What are you wearing?
ANNIE I don't know.
BETSY I wish you would wear my dress.
BETSY I only wore it once, and you'll
BETSY barely have to do anything to
BETSY it except take it in in the
BETSY bust --
BARBARA I have something that might do
Walter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides
of cloud formations in Guatemala.
In the next room
Tom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas
carols.
MAX, one of the children, is teaching Uncle Milton to
burp.
The sound of Christmas carols from below.
The attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with
her mother.
They come to a dressmakers dummy with a
sheet over it.
Barbara removes the sheet.
A beautiful
antique dress.
A veil sitting on top of the dummy.
BARBARA The Historical Society wanted
BARBARA this and I never would give it
BARBARA to them --
ANNIE Granny's dress.
ANNIE Oh, Mom.
BARBARA I notice these things are back
BARBARA in fashion.
BARBARA Oh, honey.
BARBARA (tears are rolling down
BARBARA her face as she tries
BARBARA the veil on Annie)
BARBARA He's a lovely man, Annie.
ANNIE I know.
ANNIE He's wonderful, isn't
ANNIE he?
BARBARA Are his folks nice?
ANNIE You'll love them.
ANNIE We're going
ANNIE down to D.C. tonight to be with
ANNIE them Christmas morning.
BARBARA How did it happen?
Barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back
of the dress and remove it from the dummy.
ANNIE It's silly, really.
ANNIE I mean,
ANNIE I'd seen him at the office,
ANNIE obviously I'd seen him, he's
ANNIE the associate publisher, and
ANNIE then one day we both ordered
ANNIE sandwiches from the same place,
ANNIE and he got my lettuce and
ANNIE tomato sandwich on whole wheat,
ANNIE which of course he was allergic
ANNIE to, and I got his lettuce and
ANNIE tomato on white.
BARBARA How amazing.
ANNIE It is, isn't it?
ANNIE You make
ANNIE millions of decisions that mean
ANNIE nothing and then one day you
ANNIE decide to order takeout and it
ANNIE changes your life.
BARBARA Destiny takes a hand.
ANNIE Oh, please.
ANNIE Destiny's just
ANNIE something we've invented
ANNIE because we can't stand the fact
ANNIE that everything that happens is
ANNIE accidental.
BARBARA Then how do you explain that
BARBARA you both ordered exactly the
BARBARA same sandwich except for the
BARBARA bread?
BARBARA How many people in this
BARBARA world like lettuce and tomato
BARBARA without something else like
BARBARA tuna?
ANNIE It wasn't a sign.
ANNIE It was a
ANNIE coincidence.
Barbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and Annie
steps into it.
Barbra starts to button the dress on Annie.
BARBARA I was in Atlantic City with my
BARBARA family.
BARBARA Cliff was a waiter.
BARBARA He talked me into sneaking out
BARBARA for a midnight walk on the
BARBARA Steel Pier.
BARBARA I've probably told
BARBARA you this a million times, but
BARBARA I don't care.
BARBARA And then he held
BARBARA my hand.
BARBARA I was scared.
BARBARA All
BARBARA sorts of thing were going
BARBARA through my head.
BARBARA But after a
BARBARA while I forgot about them.
BARBARA At
BARBARA one point I looked down, at our
BARBARA hands, and I couldn't tell
BARBARA which fingers were mine and
BARBARA which were his.
BARBARA And I knew.
ANNIE (hearing it for the
ANNIE first time)
ANNIE What?
BARBARA You know.
ANNIE (she doesn't know, but
ANNIE she doesn't want her
ANNIE mother to know she
ANNIE doesn't know)
ANNIE What?
BARBARA Magic.
BARBARA It was magic.
ANNIE Magic.
BARBARA I knew we would be together
BARBARA forever, and that everything
BARBARA would be wonderful, just the
BARBARA way you feel about Walter.
BARBARA Walter.
BARBARA It's quite a formal
BARBARA name, isn't it?
BARBARA One of the things I truly knew
BARBARA was that your father and I were
BARBARA going to have a wonderful time
BARBARA ...
BARBARA in the sack I believe you
BARBARA call it --
ANNIE Mom!
BARBARA Of course it took several years
BARBARA before everything worked like
BARBARA clockwork in that department,
BARBARA so don't be worried if it takes
BARBARA a while --
ANNIE Mom, we already...
BARBARA Well, fine, fine.
BARBARA Fiddle da
BARBARA dee.
BARBARA And how's it working?
ANNIE Like...
ANNIE clockwork.
She turns to look in the mirror.
The dress doesn't fit
at all.
It's completely lopsided.
One shoulder is
higher than the other.
The waist is in the wrong spot.
The effect is quite comical.
BARBARA So you'll get married in a new
BARBARA dress.
ANNIE It's a sign.
BARBARA You don't believe in signs.
The house Christmas lights sparkle outside, twinkling on
the tree inside, and the warm light spilling out.
ANNIE They loved you.
ANNIE I told you
ANNIE they would love you and they
ANNIE did.
WALTER I love you.
ANNIE I love you, Walter.
ANNIE Did anyone ever call you
ANNIE anything other than Walter?
WALTER Nope.
ANNIE Even when you were young?
WALTER Nope.
WALTER Not even when I was
WALTER young.
It's starting to rain.
WALTER You sure you don't want to
WALTER drive with me?
ANNIE How will I get back to
ANNIE Baltimore Saturday?
ANNIE Oh God, I forgot my present for
ANNIE your stepmother -- I took it
ANNIE inside by accident.
WALTER I'll wait.
ANNIE Don't be silly.
ANNIE I'll just be
ANNIE ten minutes behind you.
As Annie drives back toward Washington, D.C.
Raining.
Annie driving.
Presents on the front seat.
She's
singing "Sleigh Ride" and doing all the sound effects
and clipclops and giddyups.
After a moment, she
realizes she doesn't know all the words and turns on the
radio.
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE Welcome back to "You and Your
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE Emotions."
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE I'm Dr. Marcia
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE Fieldstone broadcasting across
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE America from the top of the
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE Sears Tower in Chicago where we
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE would have a fantastic view of
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE Santa Claus and his reindeer if
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE there was a -- oops, never
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE mind.
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE Tonight we're talking
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE about wishes and dreams.
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE What's your wishes this Christmas
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE Eve?
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE Maybe the best present
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE you can give yourself is a call
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE to me.
DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE The number is --
ANNIE Give me a break.
Annie changes the station.
RADIO VOICE The subject of the evening's
RADIO VOICE medical update is You and Your
RADIO VOICE Spleen and our host --
She flips the dial back the other way.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Our caller is from Seattle.
Annie changes the station.
RADIO VOICE Coming up, Jingle Bells
RADIO VOICE backwards, sung by the New
RADIO VOICE Jersey Cape Mayettes --
Annie twists the dial back the other way.
We hear a
YOUNG BOY's voice.
BOY'S VOICE (V.O.) Hello, this is Jonah --
BOY'S VOICE (V.O.) (there's a bleep as
BOY'S VOICE (V.O.) Jonah says his last
BOY'S VOICE (V.O.) name)
Annie's hand lingers on the dial.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) No last names, Jonah.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Hello
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) there, you sound younger than
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) our usual callers.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) How come
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) you're up so late?
JONAH (V.O.) It's not that late in Seattle.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Got me there.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) What's your
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Christmas wish, Jonah?
JONAH (V.O.) It's not for me.
JONAH (V.O.) It's for my
JONAH (V.O.) dad.
JONAH (V.O.) I think he needs a new
JONAH (V.O.) wife.
Annie shakes her head.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) You don't like the one he was
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) now?
JONAH (V.O.) He doesn't have one now.
JONAH (V.O.) That's the problem.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Where's your mom?
JONAH (V.O.) She died.
Annie closes her eyes for a moment.
ANNIE I don't believe this --
As the car drives along.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
JONAH (V.O.) I've been pretty sad, but I
JONAH (V.O.) think my dad is worse.
MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) And you're worried about him.
JONAH (V.O.) I'm worried about him, he's
JONAH (V.O.) worried about me, I ride my
JONAH (V.O.) bike to school, he follows in
JONAH (V.O.) the car, like I'm not supposed
JONAH (V.O.) to know he's there.
JONAH (V.O.) Now it's
JONAH (V.O.) Christmas, and you know what
JONAH (V.O.) happens to people at Christmas.
ANNIE They lose their minds and call
ANNIE crackpot doctors on the radio --
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Have you talked to your dad
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) about this?
JONAH (V.O.) No.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Why not?
JONAH (V.O.) It's very hard for him to talk
JONAH (V.O.) about this stuff.
JONAH (V.O.) It's like it
JONAH (V.O.) makes him sadder.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) You want me to talk to him?
ANNIE Perfect.
ANNIE Sandbag the father.
JONAH (V.O.) And you crazy?
JONAH (V.O.) He thinks shows
JONAH (V.O.) like this are dumb.
JONAH (V.O.) If you
JONAH (V.O.) didn't have an 800 number I
JONAH (V.O.) could never get away with this
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Is he home right now?
JONAH (V.O.) Yeah.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Well, I think I can help a
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) little more if I talk to him
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) directly.
JONAH (V.O.) I don't know --
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) I'm sure he won't be angry once
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) he realizes how concerned you
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) are about him.
JONAH (V.O.) Okay, but if I get yelled at,
JONAH (V.O.) I'm never gonna listen to this
JONAH (V.O.) show again.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Fair enough.
Jonah is on the telephone on the first floor of the
houseboat he lives in with Sam.
He's got the phone cord
coming out of the small first-floor study, and he's
standing near the kitchen end of a large living area
looking out at the back deck, where his dad is sitting
in a deck chair looking out at the sea.
JONAH Dad --
SAM What is it?
JONAH (V.O.) There's somebody on the phone
JONAH (V.O.) for you.
JONAH (V.O.) His name is Sam.
ANNIE This is completely disgusting.
Sam pokes his head in the back door.
He looks much as
he did eighteen months earlier, except that his hair is
a little longer.
He picks up the phone extension.
SAM Hello.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Fieldstone on Network America.
Sam looks across the room to Jonah.
SAM I'm probably not interested in
SAM whatever you're selling.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) I'm not selling anything.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Your
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) son called and asked for advice
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) on how to find you a new wife.
SAM (he really didn't get
SAM her name)
SAM Who is this?
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Network America.
SAM Jesus, are we on the air?
SAM Jonah, for God's sake --
JONAH Don't be mad at me, Dad.
Sam can see Jonah.
He's frightened.
Sam immediately
feels how upset Jonah is.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) He feels that since your wife's
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) death you've been very unhappy.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) He's genuinely worried about you.
Sam is looking at Jonah, who's rooted to the spot he's
standing on.
SAM I'm not mad at you.
SAM Okay, I'm
SAM not mad at you.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) I think it's hard for him to
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) talk to you about all this.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Maybe we could talk and it
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) would make him feel a little
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) better.
Sam hesitates.
JONAH Please --
ANNIE This is a grotesque violation
ANNIE of this man's personal life,
ANNIE but never mind --
SAM (V.O.) All righ...
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Good.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) How long ago did your
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) wife die?
SAM It's been about a year and a
SAM half.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Have you had any relationship
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) since?
SAM No.
Sam is very uncomfortable about this --
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Why not?
SAM Look, Doctor, I don't want to
SAM be rude, but --
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) And I don't want to invade your
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) privacy --
ANNIE Sure you do.
SAM (V.O.) Sure you do --
Annie smiles.
SAM Look, we had a tough time at
SAM first, but I think I'm holding
SAM my own as a dad, and Jonah and
SAM I will get along fine again as
SAM soon as I break his radio.
Annie laughs.
So does Mr. Fieldstone
Jonah is smiling too.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) I have no doubt that you're a
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) good dad.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) You can tell a lot
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) from a person's voice.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) But
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) something must be missing if
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Jonah feels that you're still
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) under a cloud.
JONAH Tell her how you don't sleep at
JONAH night.
SAM How do you know that?
Sam and Jonah both talk into their extensions, literally
talking to each other on the phone within their own
house, but also ON THE AIR.
JONAH I can hear you walking around
JONAH sometimes.
JONAH At first I thought
JONAH it was a robber.
JONAH Go ahead,
JONAH tell her, Dad.
SAM I don't think I have to now.
Sam starts across the room towards Jonah, who starts
toward him, both of them holding their phone receivers.
On the wall in the dining area is a pine bench.
SAM Look, it's almost Christmas --
SAM (as the two of them sit
SAM down together on the
SAM bench)
SAM A kid needs a mother --
He puts an arm around Jonah.
As Annie listens.
She's softened considerably.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Could it be that you need
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) someone just as much as Jonah
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) does?
ANNIE Yes.
Annie catches herself, covers her mouth in embarrassment.
ANNIE I'm losing my mind.
As Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) We've been talking to -- well,
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) let's just call him Sleepless
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) in Seattle, and we'll be right
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) back after this break with
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) listener response, your
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) response, to the things we've
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) been discussing.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) The number to
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) call is...
SAM What's she talking about?
JONAH This is where other people get
JONAH to call in and dump on what you
JONAH said.
We hear the beginning of a commercial.
Annie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio
reverie.
She goes to the counter to order some coffee.
There's a commercial on the radio.
The counter WAITRESS
LORETTA is talking to the customers -- who include a
TRUCK DRIVER at a booth.
HARRIET, a short-order-cook,
is visible through an open window to the kitchen.
LORETTA I'll bet he's tall, with a cute
LORETTA butt.
HARRIET I'll bet he hasn't shaved in a
HARRIET week.
HARRIET I'll bet he stinks.
LORETTA Shut up, Harriet.
LORETTA What'll it be?
ANNIE Coffee, please.
ANNIE Black.
ANNIE To go.
LORETTA Maybe I should hustle myself
LORETTA out to Seattle.
LORETTA Give him a
LORETTA little present for New Year's
LORETTA Eve.
HARRIET You can go there if you want
HARRIET but don't open his refrigerator.
HARRIET They don't cover anything when
HARRIET they put it in the fridge.
HARRIET They just stick it in and leave
HARRIET it there till it walks out by
HARRIET itself.
LORETTA Harriet, ever since you
LORETTA divorced your last husband,
LORETTA you've been no fun.
LORETTA I'm
LORETTA looking, and this guy pops my
LORETTA tarts.
TRUCK DRIVER Come on, Loretta, you're going
TRUCK DRIVER to have to jump-start this guy.
TRUCK DRIVER His battery's dead.
TRUCK DRIVER And look
TRUCK DRIVER at me.
TRUCK DRIVER Mister Ever-Ready.
TRUCK DRIVER Every six minutes, another
TRUCK DRIVER charge.
LORETTA I'm looking for someone
LORETTA sensitive.
ANNIE Come on, nobody wants a guy
ANNIE who's sensitive on the radio.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Let's take a call before we get
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) back to Sleepless.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Knoxville,
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Tennessee, you're on.
SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE Yes, I would just like to know
SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE where I could get this man's
SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE address?
LORETTA Honey, get on line.
As Annie gets into her car.
Annie driving toward the house where Walter's parents
live.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Do you think there's somebody
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) out there you could love as
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) much as your wife?
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Maybe even
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) more?
SAM (V.O.) It's hard to imagine.
And cut back and forth between the car and the
houseboat.
Sam and Jonah are still on the bench, but
Jonah has fallen asleep in Sam's lap.
Sam is stroking
the boy's hair.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) What are you going to do, Sam?
SAM I don't know.
SAM When I met my
SAM wife, it was so clear.
SAM I just
SAM knew.
Annie is listening now.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) What was it that made you know?
SAM I don't think I could really
SAM describe it.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Why not?
SAM And if I could describe it,
SAM it probably wouldn't be on a radio
SAM show.
SAM But what the hell.
SAM It's not
SAM one specific thing.
SAM It's more
SAM of a feeling.
Annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in
Washington, D.C., the motor running.
She's hooked now,
she's not getting out of the car until she's heard it
all.
SAM You touch her for the first
SAM time, and suddenly...
SAM you're
SAM home.
SAM It's almost like...
ANNIE Magic.
SAM Magic.
CLOSER ON ANNIE realizing she has just said this.
Realizing that it
must mean something but not knowing what.
MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Well, it's time to wrap up,
MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) folks --
A FIGURE appears at the passenger side window, which
Annie doesn't notice.
She's wiping the tears away with
her hand.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) We hope you'll call again soon.
The figure TAPS on the window --
WALTER Annie?
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) ...
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) and let us know how it's
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) going.
-- and taps again.
WALTER Annie?
She turns.
He's pointing at the locked door.
She
searches for the button.
Finally finds it so that
Walter can open the door.
ANNIE I'm sorry, Walter.
ANNIE I just
ANNIE heard the most amazing thing on
ANNIE the radio.
They start toward the front door, Walter and Annie
carrying presents, an overnight bag of Annie's.
ANNIE People call up these shows and
ANNIE you can't believe the stuff
ANNIE they say.
ANNIE It's the end of
ANNIE privacy as we know it, this
ANNIE country is just one big global
ANNIE village with everyone out there
ANNIE going blah blah blah --
As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see
a Christmas tree, glittering with lights.
A CHRISTMAS TREE GLITTERING WITH LIGHTS as we pull back to reveal:
As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut
from gift to gift:
A BROOKS ROBINSON BASEBALL GLOVE which Jonah loves and
which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing
to open:
A TIE which mystifies him, but he hangs it around his
neck.
A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES -- the kind that's used in
schoolrooms that pulls down from a roller.
And now Sam brings out a long narrow present from behind
the door and Jonah opens --
As Jonah poses with all his Christmas presents -- his
tie hanging around his neck over his bathrobe and new
plaid shirt, his baseball glove, fishing rod -- as Sam
takes his picture.
Sam opens his present from Jonah, which is something he
made in woodworking class.
SAM The hopes are perfect --
SAM beautiful, identical, smooth --
SAM and they are for something
SAM really amazing I feel it in my
SAM bones --
JONAH It's a spice rack.
SAM We desperately need a spice
SAM rack.
SAM Desperately.
SAM And we desperately need spices.
Where Sam is putting the spices they have -- pepper,
salt, paprika and oregano -- into the spice rack, which
has room for at least twenty more.
Jonah is
methodically making pancakes.
JONAH Dad?
JONAH About last night?
SAM It's never happening again.
SAM Right?
JONAH Right.
There's a knock on the door.
SAM Then it never happened.
Sam goes to answer the door.
TWO YOUNG WOMEN are standing there.
Both are wearing
quite a lot of Spandex.
One of them is named LULU.
It
says so on her jacket.
The other is JOBETH.
SAM Hi.
LULU Hi.
LULU Sam?
SAM Yes?
LULU (looking in and seeing
LULU Jonah)
LULU You must be Jonah.
Jonah nods.
LULU See.
LULU I told you.
LULU Sam and
LULU Jonah.
LULU I'm LULU.
LULU This is
LULU JoBeth.
JoBeth nods, and continues to nod as Lulu talks.
LULU We live two piers over, don't
LULU we?
LULU Number 12, right?
LULU We're
LULU having like a really neat open
LULU house today from like four to
LULU whenever if you care to stop
LULU by.
SAM Thanks, but...
SAM we've got plans.
LULU Well, here's the number.
LULU If
LULU you ever find yourself
LULU Sleepless, give us a call.
LULU We
LULU also...
LULU do babysitting.
She winks.
JoBeth nods.
Sam nods.
Lulu waves goodbye, and she and JoBeth sashay off down
the dock.
Jonah closes the door and turns to Sam.
JONAH Not.
SAM My feelings exactly.
Jonah and Sam are fishing off a dingy.
SAM How many people do you think
SAM heard that thing last night?
JONAH It plays in 50 states.
SAM What?!
JONAH Nobody else is going to know it
JONAH was us.
SAM You're right.
SAM You better hope so.
A large open newsroom-type space with REPORTERS at
computers.
Around the perimeter are glass-partitioned
offices and meeting rooms.
Inside one of the offices is
BECKY, the Lifestyle editor of the Sun.
She's at a
table with Annie, now a reporter for the section, and
two other colleagues -- KEITH and WYATT.
Wyatt is
playing Gameboy.
KEITH This man sells the greatest
KEITH soup you've ever eaten, there's
KEITH a line around the block, and he
KEITH is, I am not kidding, the meanest
KEITH man in America.
KEITH I feel strongly about this,
KEITH Becky.
KEITH This is not just about
KEITH soup.
BECKY Do it.
BECKY What else?
WYATT New Year's Eve.
WYATT Please don't
WYATT make me write it.
Becky looks at Wyatt, notices the Gameboy.
BECKY Wyatt, I do not mean to remind
BECKY you of your mother, but if you
BECKY don't put that game away, no TV
BECKY for a week.
WYATT (pushing it to the
WYATT center of the table)
WYATT Would someone look this up,
WYATT don't tell me where.
Becky is riffling through some papers on the table,
among which are some tearsheets from the Associated
Press wire.
BECKY Listen to this.
BECKY Phone service
BECKY in the greater Chicago area was
BECKY tied up for two hours Christmas
BECKY Eve because some kid called a
BECKY phone-in show to get a wife for
BECKY his father.
BECKY Two thousand women
BECKY called in for the number.
KEITH Jesus.
ANNIE I heard it.
ANNIE This kid calls up
ANNIE and says my dad needs a wife
ANNIE and I'm talking to myself in
ANNIE the car saying, this is
ANNIE completely disgusting, you're
ANNIE taking advantage of a child,
ANNIE and then the father gets on and
ANNIE this shrinkette says, do you
ANNIE want to talk about it?
ANNIE And he
ANNIE says no as a matter of fact I
ANNIE don't, and I am saying, bravo!
ANNIE Right on!
ANNIE Don't talk to her,
ANNIE it's none of her business --
ANNIE (she's completely into
ANNIE this story now)
ANNIE -- and then suddenly, for no
ANNIE reason at all, he's talking
ANNIE about how much he loved his
ANNIE wife, and how he just --
ANNIE fell in love with her and I am
ANNIE crying.
ANNIE Me.
ANNIE A tear is
ANNIE actually rolling down my face.
ANNIE It was like what happens when I
ANNIE watch those phone company ads.
ANNIE I don't have to see the whole
ANNIE ad, I just have to see the part
ANNIE where the daughter gives her
ANNIE mother a refrigerator with a
ANNIE big red bow on it, have you
ANNIE seen that one?
Everyone looks at her.
Apparently she's finished.
BECKY You should write something
BECKY about this.
ANNIE About what?
BECKY Whatever it is.
KEITH What it is is, there are a lot
KEITH of desperate women out there
KEITH looking for love.
WYATT Especially over a certain age.
Annie is looking at them.
This isn't what she was
talking about at all, although she isn't quite sure what
she was talking about.
KEITH It is easier to be killed by a
KEITH terrorist after the age of 40
KEITH than it is to get married --
ANNIE That is not true.
ANNIE That
ANNIE statistic is not true.
BECKY It's not true, but it feels
BECKY true.
ANNIE There's practically a whole
ANNIE book about how that statistic
ANNIE is not true --
WYATT Calm down.
WYATT You brought it up --
ANNIE I did not, Wyatt.
A beat, everyone pauses.
Things are a little out of
hand.
BECKY So where were we?
WYATT New Year's Eve.
WYATT I'll do it,
WYATT okay?
BECKY Okay.
ANNIE If someone is a widower, why do
ANNIE they say he was widowed?
ANNIE Why
ANNIE don't they say he was widowered?
Everyone looks at her strangely.
ANNIE I was jus wondering.
Annie walking purposefully, followed by Becky, hurrying
to catch up.
BECKY What was that about up there?
ANNIE What was what?
BECKY What's with you?
ANNIE Nothing's with me.
Becky and Annie are having lunch.
BECKY "Sleepless in Seattle"?
ANNIE That's what she called him on
ANNIE the show.
ANNIE Because he can't
ANNIE sleep.
BECKY And now 2,000 women want his
BECKY number.
BECKY The guy could be a
BECKY crackhead, a psychopath, a
BECKY flasher, a junkie, a
BECKY transvestite, a chain-saw
BECKY murderer, or someone really
BECKY sick, like Rick.
ANNIE Actually, he sounded nice.
BECKY Oh?
BECKY Oh, really?
BECKY Now we're
BECKY getting down to it.
ANNIE Not.
She reaches down for her purse.
A hand reaching down to pick something up -- the Seattle
newspaper, and
Sam carrying the paper down/up the stairs to an old
house that's being renovated.
Jonah, who is playing
Cameboy, is walking along with him.
WORKMEN are active
everywhere.
Dry wall going up, cabinets being
installed, tile being set.
One of Sam's partners, BOB LANGMAN, is walking with him,
and JAY MATHEWS, the on-site supervisor, is waiting for
them in an unfinished doorframe.
Bob is hefty, older,
always eating something dietetic.
Jay is younger and
always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather.
BOB LANGMAN Now she wants a circular
BOB LANGMAN stairwell off the den.
JAY Punch me, punch in right here.
JAY (points to his stomach;
JAY Jonah punches)
JAY And she wants the Sub-Zero with
JAY the side-by-side doors --
BOB Which means --
SAM The cabinets have to be redone
They all nod at each other.
The woman has been a
nightmare.
BOB So we thought --
JAY Since you're on the make again
Sam looks at Jonah --
SAM Great.
SAM This is great.
SAM The
SAM whole town knows.
SAM Just out of
SAM curiosity, how do you two know?
BOB Grace heard it.
SAM Grace the dispatcher.
SAM Great.
BOB The point is, take the client
BOB out to dinner and ask her to
BOB marry you and then maybe we
BOB won't have to redo the kitchen
BOB cabinets.
SAM Why me?
SAM What about Jay?
JAY Hey, my plate is full.
SAM Well, okay.
SAM What's the big
SAM deal?
SAM If she'll forget the
SAM new fireplace, I'll marry her.
SAM Just point me in the right
SAM direction.
JONAH Dad, I don't know about this
JONAH one --
SAM Oh, you're changing your mind
JONAH No, I'm not, but --
SAM What's the matter with this
SAM one?
SAM Wouldn't you like to have
SAM Imelda Marcos as your mother?
JONAH Dad --
Sam cuffs him good-naturedly.
SAM We better take the measurements
SAM for the new cabinets.
He walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc.
and
starts checking the cross-beams in the ceiling over in
another area of the site.
Bob follows after him.
Jay
tosses Jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into
the wall.
BOB Sam, if you're not doing
BOB anything New Year's --
BOB obviously you're not doing
BOB anything New Year's -- we're
BOB having some people over, all of
BOB them married, not one even
BOB remotely interested in playing
BOB around.
BOB Does that sound great
BOB or what?
BOB I can't think of the last time
BOB I was at a party when anything
BOB actually happened.
SAM Thanks, but I'll pass.
SAM It's
SAM kind of a big night.
SAM I don't
SAM like to leave Jonah alone.
Jonah watching it.
Sam visible in the distance in the
kitchen.
As Sam is busy installing the spice rack.
He marks the
wall, hammers in the nails, etc.
SAM (as he starts putting
SAM new spices into the
SAM rack, in alphabetical
SAM order)
SAM Does red pepper go under R or
P. Dad?
SAM What?
JONAH I forgot to mention.
JONAH Jed
JONAH called --
SAM Just out of curiosity, do you
SAM have any friends whose names
SAM don't begin with a J?
SAM I feel
SAM like it was a failure of the
SAM imagination on our part naming
SAM you Jonah.
SAM What is marjoram?
SAM Does anyone
SAM know?
JONAH Jed is having a slumber party
JONAH New Year's Eve and he invited
JONAH me.
A beat.
SAM Fine.
SAM Fine.
JONAH So I can go.
SAM Sure.
SAM (almost done with the
SAM spices)
SAM Looking good.
JONAH Shouldn't you have used a
JONAH toggle bolt?
SAM I think I know how to have a
SAM spice rack.
He puts in the last spice.
They stand back to admire it.
A beat.
The rack falls
off the wall.
The rack itself doesn't break, but about six of the
glass jars of spices break.
There's paprika and thyme and currying powder, etc.
all
over the floor along with shards of glass.
SAM God fucking dammit!
SAM Shit!
SAM Fuck.
SAM Piss.
Jonah bursts into tears.
SAM I'm sorry.
SAM I'm sorry.
He picks up Jonah and holds him.
SAM I'm sorry.
SAM I'm just --
JONAH Stressed.
SAM Right.
SAM I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm
SAM sorry.
And he holds Jonah as Jonah calms down.
Sam closes his
eyes tight.
And pull back to reveal:
Sam, alone, watching the ball drop.
He's got a bag of
Doritos and a beer.
A VOICE Can I have half your beer?
SAM Sure.
It's Maggie.
She takes his bottle of beer and pours half of it into a
glass.
MAGGIE What did I used to say?
MAGGIE Here's
MAGGIE looking at you?
MAGGIE Here's mud in
MAGGIE your eye?
SAM Here's to us.
SAM You used to say
SAM here's to us.
SAM (he looks at her and
SAM his eyes well with
SAM tears)
SAM Oh babe.
SAM I miss you so much it
SAM hurts.
He reaches out for her.
She's gone.
And we hear the television set now counting down to
midnight in New York.
The same television show counting down to midnight.
Champagne corks popping, etc.
And we see Walter and Annie.
WALTER Happy New Year, darling.
ANNIE Happy New Year.
They start to dance.
WALTER I was thinking, I have to go up
WALTER to Boston for the AAP
WALTER convention and then visit
WALTER Winston-Hughes about switching
WALTER over our computers.
WALTER Why don't
WALTER we meet in New York for
WALTER Valentine's Day weekend?
ANNIE Walter, I'd love to --
WALTER We'll stay at the Plaza --
ANNIE Go for a walk in Central Park --
WALTER Go to the Symphony --
A beat.
ANNIE We will?
ANNIE The Symphony?
ANNIE Okay.
ANNIE I'll take you to the Russian
ANNIE Tea Room for pelmeni.
WALTER What is it?
ANNIE It's delicious, trust me.
WALTER Does it have wheat in it?
ANNIE I don't think so.
They go on dancing.
It's one of those parties where
everyone looks so happy and so in love.
Annie, however,
looks thoughtful.
Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward
his houseboat.
He's carrying a bag of groceries.
In the parking lot is a U.S. MAIL TRUCK.
Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over
his face.
A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the
front door of the houseboat.
Jonah is signing a receipt
for the mail.
JONAH Look at this, Dad.
JONAH They're
JONAH all for you --
Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it.
It's
addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr. Marcia
Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago.
He's
stunned.
As he signs the receipt:
MAILMAN If you're having trouble
MAILMAN sleeping, you might want to try
MAILMAN drinking a glass of water from
MAILMAN the other side.
JONAH I thought that was for hiccups.
MAILMAN Does it work for hiccups?
JONAH For hiccups, a spoonful of
JONAH sugar, you hold it in your
JONAH mouth for a minute.
MAILMAN Really?
The mailman starts back toward the mail truck.
Sam and Jonah start toward the door.
Sam is in the kitchen making dinner.
Jonah is sitting
at the table, reading the letters from the stack they
found by the door.
SAM Just out of curiosity, how did
SAM they get our address?
JONAH They called and asked for it.
JONAH "Dear Sleepless in Seattle.
JONAH You are the most attractive man
JONAH I've ever laid ears on."
Jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of
rejects, opens another.
SAM How did they get our phone
SAM number?
JONAH You have to give them your
JONAH phone number or they won't let
JONAH you go on the air.
Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense.
JONAH "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I
JONAH am an SWF"--
JONAH What is that?
SAM Thank God.
SAM Something you don't
SAM know.
SAM It's a single white
SAM female.
JONAH This is no good.
JONAH She's looking
JONAH for someone French.
JONAH Or Greek.
JONAH (puzzled, he throws the
JONAH letter into the reject
JONAH pile, opens another)
JONAH "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I
JONAH live in Tulsa."
JONAH Where is that?
SAM Oklahoma.
SAM Do you know where
SAM that is?
JONAH Somewhere in the middle.
SAM I'm not going to think about
SAM what they're not teaching you
SAM in school.
SAM I am not going to
SAM think about it.
SAM Generally speaking I think we
SAM should rule out people who
SAM don't live somewhere near here
JONAH She's willing to fly anywhere.
As Jonah hands Sam the picture.
SAM She looks like my third grade
SAM teacher.
SAM I hated my third
SAM grade teacher.
SAM Hold it!
SAM Wait
SAM a minute!
SAM She is my third
SAM grade teacher!
JONAH Dad, you're not taking this
JONAH seriously.
SAM This is not how you do it.
SAM (referring to the
SAM hamburger)
SAM You want this on an English
SAM muffin or a bun?
JONAH English muffin.
JONAH How do you do
JONAH it?
SAM You see someone you like, you
SAM get a feeling about them, you
SAM ask them if they want to have a
SAM drink or --
JONAH -- a slice of pizza --
SAM But not dinner necessarily on
SAM the first date because by the
SAM time you're halfway through
SAM dinner you might be sorry you
SAM asked them to dinner whereas if
SAM it's just a drink, if you like
SAM them you can always ask them
SAM for dinner but if you don't you
SAM can go home if you see what I
SAM mean.
SAM I wonder if it still works this
SAM way.
JONAH It doesn't.
JONAH They ask you.
SAM I'm starting to notice that.
Annie and Walter are making love.
JONAH (V.O.) If you get a new wife, I guess
JONAH (V.O.) you'll have sex with her, huh?
SAM (V.O.) What do you think?
JONAH (V.O.) Will she scratch up your back?
SAM (V.O.) What?
As Sam puts Jonah to sleep.
Jonah is holding his teddy
bear while this conversation concludes.
JONAH In the movies women are always
JONAH scratching up guy's back and
JONAH screaming and stuff.
JONAH When
JONAH they're having sex.
SAM Whose show was this on?
JONAH Jed's got cables.
SAM Go to sleep.
He kisses him good-night.
JONAH Kiss Howard.
JONAH (he holds out the
JONAH teddy bear)
JONAH G'night, Howard.
Annie and Walter have just finished making love.
Walter falling asleep.
Annie lying in bed, with her eyes open.
She starts to get out of bed.
Puts on a robe.
As Annie comes downstairs in a bathrobe.
She opens the door to the street.
As Annie starts to run down the street.
And now we widen out to see a misty highway she's running
down.
Past a sign saying: Seattle Approximately 3,000 miles.
Past another sign: Your nerves are shot.
And another: Your feet are cold.
And another: Will you find love.
And another: Before you're cold?
And another: Burma Shave.
And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running
across a map of the United States -- it's a little like
the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's
like the famous map of the United States by Saul
Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one
is about Seattle.
In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two
indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy.
They start
to wave at her, very slowly.
Annie's eyes widen.
Annie in bed, eyes open.
Walter fast asleep.
She gets out of bed, puts on her robe (just as she did
in the dream sequence).
As Annie comes down the stairs.
She turns the light on.
Opens the refrigerator.
Closes it.
Opens it again.
Takes out some milk.
Sits down at the kitchen table with a bowl, corn flakes,
banana.
She's about to assemble it when:
She sees:
She stands up, turns it on to the station Dr. Marcia
Fieldstone is on.
She sits back down with her corn
flakes.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Up next, "You and Your
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Emotions" with Dr. Marcia
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Fieldstone, clinical
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) psychologist and the best
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) friend you never had.
He says he doesn't love me any
more.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Why do you want to be with
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) someone who doesn't love you?
ANOTHER WOMAN (V.O.) Every time I come close to
ANOTHER WOMAN (V.O.) orgasm he stops and goes to
ANOTHER WOMAN (V.O.) make himself a sandwich --
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Why don't you make him a
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) sandwich beforehand?
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) When I met my wife, it was so
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) clear.
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) I jus knew.
Annie starts at hearing Sam's voice.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) What was it that made you know?
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) I don't think I could really
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) describe it.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Why not?
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) And if I could describe it, it
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) probably wouldn't be on a radio
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) show.
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) But what the hell.
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) It's not
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) one specific thing.
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) It's more
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) of a feeling.
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) You touch her for the first
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) time, and suddenly...
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) you're
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) home.
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) It's almost like...
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) magic.
Annie closes her eyes.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) We'll be back after this
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) commercial with Dr. Marcia
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Fieldstone.
We see Annie's car pull into a parking space outside the
Peabody Library.
Annie gets out of the car.
As Annie strides purposefully across the library and
enters:
Annie bursts into Tom's office and walks over to his
desk.
We barely has time to look up.
ANNIE I think I'm going crazy, Tom.
ANNIE I really do.
ANNIE Are you happily
ANNIE married?
TOM (completely panicked by
TOM the question)
TOM What?
ANNIE I mean, why did you get
ANNIE married?
ANNIE Was it all fireworks
ANNIE and trumpets and --
TOM I got married because Betsy
TOM said we had to break up or get
TOM married.
TOM So we get married.
ANNIE But when you met her, did you
ANNIE believe she was the only person
ANNIE for you?
ANNIE That in some mystical,
ANNIE cosmic way, it was fated?
TOM Annie, when you meet someone
TOM and you're attracted to them,
TOM it just means that your
TOM subconscious is attracted to
TOM their subconscious,
TOM subconsciously.
TOM So what we
TOM think of as chemistry is just
TOM two neuroses knowing that they
TOM are a perfect match.
ANNIE I don't even know him.
ANNIE But
ANNIE I'm having all these fantasies
ANNIE about a man I've never met,
ANNIE who lives in Seattle.
TOM It rains nine months of the
TOM year in Seattle.
ANNIE I know, I know.
ANNIE I do not want
ANNIE to move to Seattle.
ANNIE But what I
ANNIE really don't want to do is end
ANNIE up always wondering what might
ANNIE have happened and knowing I
ANNIE could have done something.
ANNIE What do you think?
ANNIE (Tom opens his mouth to
ANNIE say something, but
ANNIE before anything comes
ANNIE out, Annie fills the
ANNIE void)
ANNIE It's just cold feet, isn't it?
ANNIE Everyone panics before they get
ANNIE married, didn't you?
TOM Yes, I did.
ANNIE Thank you, Tom.
ANNIE I feel so much
ANNIE better just having blown this
ANNIE off.
TOM Any time.
As Annie walks through it and pushes the door to exit.
Sam and Jay walk out of the Arctic Building onto the
street.
JAY Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda
JAY ...
JAY She's a weightlifter, but
JAY it's not like her neck is
JAY bigger than her head or
JAY anything --
SAM I'm not asking you to set me
SAM up, Jay.
SAM That's not what I
SAM need your help for.
SAM I want to
SAM know what it's like over there.
JAY And that's what I'm trying to
JAY tell you.
JAY What women are
JAY looking over, okay?
JAY Pecs and a
JAY cute butt.
SAM You mean, like, "He has the
SAM cutest butt"?
SAM Where did I hear
SAM that recently?
JAY Everywhere.
JAY You can't even
JAY turn on the news without
JAY hearing about how some babe
JAY thought some guy's butt was
JAY cute.
JAY Who the first babe to
JAY say this was I don't know,
JAY but it caught on.
Sam and Jay at the counter.
Out the window, we can see
water.
JAY When's the latest time you were
JAY out there?
SAM Seventy...
SAM eight.
JAY Well.
JAY Things are different.
JAY First, you have to be friends.
JAY You have to like each other.
JAY Then you neck.
JAY This can go on
JAY for years.
JAY Then you have
JAY tests.
JAY Then you get to do it
JAY with a condom.
JAY The good news is, split the
JAY check.
SAM I don't think it could let a
SAM woman pay for dinner.
JAY Great.
JAY They'll have a parade
JAY in your honor.
JAY You'll be Man
JAY of the Year in Seattle
JAY Magazine.
JAY Tira misu.
SAM What's tira misu?
JAY You'll find out.
SAM What is it?
JAY You'll see.
SAM Some woman is going to want me
SAM to do it to her and I'm not
SAM going to know what it is.
JAY You'll like it.
SAM This is going to be tougher
SAM than I thought.
Sam coming home.
As he enters.
It's very quiet.
Too quiet.
SAM Jonah?
No answers.
SAM Jonah?
He starts to look concerned.
SAM Jonah?
He goes down the hall to Jonah's room.
The door is
shut.
He opens it.
Jonah is sitting on his bed listening to a tape.
Earphones on.
Next to him is a young girl named
SAM Jonah?
Jonah takes off the earphones.
JONAH Hi, Dad.
JONAH Dad, this is Jessica.
SAM It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
JONAH Dad, this is amazing.
JONAH If you
JONAH play this backwards, it says
JONAH "Paul is dead."
SAM I know.
JONAH How do you know?
Sam shrugs, turns to go back down the hall.
JONAH Dad, could you close the door?
JESSICA H and G.
JESSICA Hi and goodbye.
Sam closes the door to Jonah's room.
Hold on Sam.
SAM Get a life.
As Sam comes downstairs, goes into his office.
Closes
the door.
He goes to the phone.
Looks up a number in the phone
book.
Picks up the phone and dials a number.
SAM Hi, Victoria?...
SAM It's Sam
SAM Baldwin, I don't know if you
SAM remember me.
SAM Oh?
SAM Well, great.
SAM I was wondering if you wanted
SAM to have a drink...
SAM Friday,
SAM say...
SAM Dinner?...
SAM Sure, dinner
SAM would be fine.
SAM Sure.
SAM Dinner.
Annie is watching "An Affair to Remember" on television,
tears pouring down her face.
Cary Grant is saying: "Are
you in love with him?" Deborah Kerr replies: "I'm not
now."
She's sitting at the dining room table.
A dozen pieces
of paper litter the table.
Annie's been unsuccessfully
typing a letter on an old Underwood typewriter.
ANNIE Now those were the days when
ANNIE people knew how to be in love.
She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right.
Becky leans in, refilling the glass.
Annie begins to
type and sob and look at the TV.
BECKY You're a basket case.
ANNIE They knew it.
ANNIE Time, distance,
ANNIE nothing could separate them.
ANNIE Because they knew.
ANNIE It was
ANNIE right.
ANNIE It was real.
ANNIE It was...
BECKY ...
BECKY movie.
BECKY That's your problem.
BECKY You don't
BECKY want to be in love.
BECKY You want
BECKY to be in love in a movie.
BECKY Read it to me.
ANNIE "Dear Sleepless and Son..."
BECKY It sounds like the name of a
BECKY mattress store --
ANNIE "I am not the sort of person
ANNIE who listens to call-in radio
ANNIE shows" --
Becky flops on the couch.
BECKY And this woman is a writer!
BECKY That's what everyone writes at
BECKY the beginning of letters to
BECKY strangers.
ANNIE I know that.
ANNIE You think I don't
ANNIE know that?
ANNIE "I know that's a
ANNIE dumb way to begin, but it's the
ANNIE only way I can think of to
ANNIE convey what happened to me the
ANNIE other night when I heard the
ANNIE two of you on the radio.
ANNIE On
ANNIE the other hand, maybe I'm just
ANNIE losing my mind."
BECKY You are.
BECKY You're losing your
BECKY mind.
BECKY What about Walter?
ANNIE I'm going to marry Walter.
ANNIE just have to get this out of my
ANNIE system.
BECKY Right.
ANNIE I should say something in this
ANNIE about magic.
BECKY What?
ANNIE I don't know.
ANNIE I mean, what if
ANNIE I never meet him?
ANNIE What if this
ANNIE man is my destiny and I never
ANNIE meet him?
BECKY Your destiny can be your doom.
BECKY Look at me and Rick.
ANNIE "I want to meet you..."
Cary Grant says: "How about the top of the Empire State
Building?"
BECKY "On top of the Empire State
BECKY Building at sunset on
BECKY Valentine's Day."
ANNIE Good.
ANNIE Perfect.
ANNIE I'll be in New
ANNIE York with Walter, I can squeeze
ANNIE it in.
She types in Becky's idea.
Then she takes the piece of paper out of the typewriter,
smashes it into a ball and tosses it up in the air and
into Becky's lap.
BECKY You want to hear about destiny?
BECKY If my husband hadn't gone on a
BECKY diet, which caused me to leave
BECKY him, I would never have been on
BECKY that flight to Miami, and met
BECKY Rick, and ended up having sex
BECKY in the bathroom of a 727 with
BECKY that nob you slide that says
BECKY "vacant-occupied, vacant-
BECKY occupied, vacant-occupied" --
BECKY (she shudders in
BECKY ecstasy, then pulls
BECKY herself together)
ANNIE You never told me you left your
ANNIE husband because he went on a
ANNIE diet.
BECKY He lost all the weight...
BECKY there.
ANNIE That's impossible.
ANNIE A guy can't
BECKY Can too.
ANNIE No.
BECKY Yes.
ANNIE And then you left him?
ANNIE He lost
ANNIE weight there and you left him?
BECKY Plus he fell in love with a
BECKY temp.
ANNIE Listen to this, I love this
ANNIE part --
Deborah Kerr says: "It's now or never."
And Cary Grant
says: "We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by."
Deborah Kerr: "Winter must be cold for those with no
warm memories."
Becky and Annie with tears rolling down their faces.
BECKY Men never get this movie.
ANNIE I know.
BECKY Do you think at the end of the
BECKY movie when she's in the
BECKY wheelchair they can still do
BECKY it?
ANNIE I always wondered about that
ANNIE too.
As Becky reaches for a Kleenex.
A Kleenex being pulled from a box.
Sam is giving it to
Jonah, who's up.
His hair is mated with perspiration.
SAM It's okay, it's okay.
SAM I'm
SAM here.
A beat while Jonah calms down.
JONAH It was sinking.
SAM What was?
JONAH Our house.
JONAH There was water
JONAH coming in all the windows.
SAM You're worried we're going to
SAM be all right.
SAM We're going to
SAM be all right.
SAM (Sam gives Jonah a
SAM squeeze)
SAM I remember sometimes you'd have
SAM nightmares as a baby.
SAM Your mom
SAM would hold you and rock you and
SAM sing you a song.
JONAH Bye bye blackbird.
SAM Is that what she used to sing?
JONAH I miss her.
JONAH What do you think happens to
JONAH someone after they die?
SAM I don't know.
JONAH Like do you believe in heaven?
SAM I never did.
SAM Or the whole idea
SAM of an afterlife.
SAM But I don't
SAM know any more.
SAM I have these
SAM dreams about...
SAM your mom...
SAM and
SAM we have long talks about...
SAM about you, and how you are,
SAM which she sort of knows but I
SAM tell her anyway.
SAM So what is
SAM that?
SAM It's sort of an afterlife,
SAM isn't it?
JONAH I'm starting to forget her.
SAM I know.
SAM But she's here, Jonah.
SAM Because I have you.
SAM And as
SAM long as I have you, I have your
SAM Mom.
Hold on the two of them as music begins.
Bye Bye
Blackbird.
SAM I...
SAM uh...
SAM have a date with
SAM someone Friday night.
JONAH Good.
A beat.
SAM Did I ever tell you about the
SAM time I ate a dog biscuit?
As Jonah cuddles closer MUSIC COMES UP AS WE PULL BACK
AS MUSIC CONTINUES.
Annie waves as Becky gets into her
car and rides away.
Annie turns to her doorway and
stops.
She can't go back in.
She needs to walk and
think.
She crosses the street into a little
neighborhood park.
We can see the moon.
Sam comes out onto the porch.
Flops down in his deck
chair.
The city lights in the background.
Same moon.
The MUSIC CONTINUES.
Annie flops down on a child's swing set in the park.
As Walter pulls up into the parking space Becky pulled
out of.
Annie starts toward him.
Make my bed and light the lights I'll arrive late
tonight, blackbird, bye bye.
Annie on the phone at her desk.
ANNIE Laurie, it's Annie.
ANNIE Fine, I'm
ANNIE fine.
ANNIE Listen, I'm doing an
ANNIE article on call-in radio shows.
ANNIE Do you know anyone who works
ANNIE for someone named Dr. Marcia
ANNIE Fieldstone...?
Annie on the phone.
ANNIE I'm a writer for the Baltimore
ANNIE Sun and I'm a friend of Laurie
ANNIE Johnson's.
ANNIE I'm doing a piece
ANNIE on how people handle
ANNIE bereavement and I understand
ANNIE that you had a caller the other
ANNIE night...
ANNIE I know you're not
ANNIE supposed to, but Laurie said
ANNIE you might, and I'll plug the
ANNIE show and everything --
ANNIE (she winces in
ANNIE anticipation of a
ANNIE rejection, but then
ANNIE her face relaxes)
Annie dialing Sam's telephone number.
JONAH (ON MACHINE) This is Jonah Baldwin, we're
JONAH (ON MACHINE) not in right now but you can
JONAH (ON MACHINE) leave --
Annie hangs up.
ANNIE Baldwin.
Annie at her computer modem.
She's dialing a number.
We hear some beeps.

Thursday, Church of the Heavenly

ANNIE Samuel
ANNIE J.
ANNIE Baldwin, architect, built
ANNIE City Plaza.
A PRINTOUT OF AN ARTICLE that Annie's reading.
There's a newspaper picture of
Sam at the dedication of a building site.
It's got that
kind of grainy quality that things have when they've
been transmitted, but you can make out Sam's basic good
looks.
Annie coming from the street toward a storefront in
downtown Baltimore across the street from the courthouse.
Next door there's a bailbondsman, there are ambulance-
chasing lawyers hanging out on the corner.
The sign on the door reads: "No job too small."
"All
major credit cards accepted."
And then everything on
the sign is translated into Spanish.
Detective Bo Wheedle, a former cop, sits at his desk
listening to Annie.
He has some papers.
ANNIE I need to know about him
ANNIE because...
ANNIE he's involved with
ANNIE my sister...
DET. WHEEDLE Okay.
ANNIE She has a pattern of getting
ANNIE involved with losers...
ANNIE Once
ANNIE she almost ran away with a
ANNIE human cannonball from the
ANNIE circus.
DET. WHEEDLE Do you want a matrimonial, past
DET. WHEEDLE wives, any kids--
ANNIE No, I know that part --
DET. WHEEDLE So you want a financial, is he
DET. WHEEDLE a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
ANNIE No, no, no, it's more like, who
ANNIE is he, does he have a sense of
ANNIE humor, is he nice -- no forget
ANNIE nice, I've got nice --
DET. WHEEDLE A sense of humor.
ANNIE I'll tell you the truth, I
ANNIE heard this guy on a call-in
ANNIE radio show and I might not
ANNIE marry the person I should marry
ANNIE because I've become obsessed
ANNIE with him.
DET. WHEEDLE Oh.
DET. WHEEDLE Like Glenn Close in that
DET. WHEEDLE movie.
ANNIE No.
ANNIE Not remotely.
ANNIE I just want
ANNIE to find out about him.
DET. WHEEDLE You want a tail.
DET. WHEEDLE I got a guy in Seattle --
Jonah is watching Geraldo with his babysitter, CLARISE,
17.
Geraldo is talking to a heavily made-up, sexily-dressed
GERALDO So how long have you been a
GERALDO woman?
WOMAN About two weeks.
Sam is coming down the stairs.
CLARISE Pssst!
Jonah hits the remote control and the channel changes to
the Disney channel as Sam comes into the room, dressed
for his date.
SAM Clarise, I'll be back by
SAM midnight I'm sure --
CLARISE Whenever.
Sam tosses Jonah a letter.
SAM This one's for both of us.
JONAH (reading from the
JONAH envelope)
JONAH Sleepless and Son.
JONAH Baltimore.
He starts to open the letter.
SAM I left the number of the
SAM restaurant I'll be at if
SAM there's any emergency.
CLARISE Fine.
SAM How do I look?
JONAH Great.
SAM I look stupid.
SAM I look stupid,
SAM don't I?
SAM I look like I'm
SAM trying too hard.
SAM I was going
SAM to get a haircut but then I
SAM thought I'd look like I just
SAM got a haircut.
SAM (checks his teeth,
SAM peers up his nose)
JONAH This is a good letter, Dad.
SAM (checks his fly, looks
SAM down at his feet)
SAM The heels on these shoes are
SAM very large.
SAM Why have I never
SAM noticed this?
SAM The heels on
SAM these shoes are grotesque.
JONAH Her name is Annie.
JONAH Annie Reed.
SAM Now I'm late.
SAM Bye.
He starts toward the door.
JONAH Listen to this --
SAM Not now, Jonah --
JONAH Just this one part, okay?
JONAH "I have been an excellent
JONAH third-baseman for as long as I
JONAH or anyone else can remember,
JONAH and I guarantee you will not
JONAH get one past me"
SAM Jonah, I'm leaving --
WAIT!!! (Sam stops, amazed at
WAIT!!! Jonah's vehemence;
WAIT!!! Jonah continues
WAIT!!! reading)
WAIT!!! -- "and while we're on the
WAIT!!! subject, let's just say right
WAIT!!! now that Brooks Robinson was
WAIT!!! the best third baseman ever.
WAIT!!! It's important that you agree
WAIT!!! with me on that because I'm
WAIT!!! from Baltimore."
WAIT!!! Dad, she
WAIT!!! thinks Brooks Robinson is the
WAIT!!! greatest.
Sam goes out the door with Jonah behind him, waving the
letter.
JONAH Dad!
SAM Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson
SAM is the greatest.
JONAH It's a sign.
SAM Oh, right.
Sam stops, takes Jonah by the hand and takes him back
into the house.
SAM Come here.
SAM I want to show you
SAM something.
As Sam pulls down the map of the United States, which is
hanging over one of the kitchen windows and stands Jonah
in front of it.
SAM Here is Seattle.
SAM (moves his finger
SAM across the country)
SAM And here is Baltimore.
SAM Case
SAM closed.
SAM (he pulls the map and
SAM it snaps back up)
JONAH She doesn't want us to go to
JONAH Baltimore.
JONAH She wants to meet
JONAH us in New York City on
JONAH Valentine's Day.
JONAH On top of the
JONAH Empire State Building.
SAM Perfect.
SAM We'll be there.
Sam goes out the door.
Jonah just looks down at his
letter, his hopes on hold.
Clarise switches the TV back
to Geraldo.
Sam sits at a table.
Nursing a beer.
A little nervous.
He looks up and spots:
VICTORIA walking into the place.
She's attractive.
She waves
and smiles and sits down, orders a white wine spritzer
from the maitre d'.
After a beat.
SAM Hi.
VICTORIA Hi.
An awkward pause.
SAM You look good.
VICTORIA You look good yourself.
Another pause.
VICTORIA I thought you were never going
VICTORIA to call me.
SAM You did?
VICTORIA I really wanted you to call me,
VICTORIA and I thought you were never
VICTORIA going to --
SAM You could have called me --
VICTORIA No way.
VICTORIA No way I was going to
VICTORIA be the first woman you went out
VICTORIA with after...
VICTORIA (she gestures
VICTORIA helplessly)
VICTORIA There is no percentage
VICTORIA whatsoever in being the first
VICTORIA woman anyone goes out with
VICTORIA after...
SAM You are the first woman I'm
SAM going out with.
VICTORIA Oh.
SAM So whatdya say?
SAM I'll get the
SAM check, and I'll call you in
SAM eight months.
Victoria laughs far too enthusiastically.
VICTORIA Oh, you are funny --
We hear a CLICK as the image FREEZES.
SEATTLE DETECTIVE sitting at a table across the room, having just taken
the picture of Sam we saw frozen, with a miniature
camera.
In QUICK CUTS we see a progression of later
photographs:
Lots and lots of fish stalls with crabs, etc.
Annie is
walking with Det.
Wheedle toward a table you stand at
near the clam bar.
ANNIE Tell me he's living in squalor.
ANNIE Tell me everything he has is
ANNIE being repossessed, including
ANNIE his filthy, dented mobile home.
WHEEDLE He's got a houseboat.
ANNIE I hate boats.
WHEEDLE It sounds nice.
ANNIE Boats.
ANNIE You go out in them.
ANNIE You come back in them.
ANNIE I hate
ANNIE them.
WHEEDLE Houseboats don't go anywhere.
ANNIE Boats.
ANNIE All anyone talks about
ANNIE is the wind.
ANNIE Is it up, is it
ANNIE down.
ANNIE I can't live with a man
ANNIE who only talks about the wind.
WHEEDLE It's not a boat boat.
WHEEDLE It's
WHEEDLE really a house.
ANNIE But it's on the water.
WHEEDLE It's on the lake right in the
WHEEDLE middle of Seattle.
WHEEDLE It rains nine months of the
WHEEDLE year in Seattle.
ANNIE I hope I don't have to pay for
ANNIE that piece of information.
WHEEDLE No, that's free.
WHEEDLE He's an
WHEEDLE architect.
WHEEDLE Used to do big
WHEEDLE high-profile projects.
WHEEDLE He
WHEEDLE scaled it all back when his
WHEEDLE wife died.
WHEEDLE Now he remodels
WHEEDLE people's homes.
WHEEDLE He works in
WHEEDLE a small firm, makes a good
WHEEDLE living.
He shows her a good picture of him.
ANNIE He's real.
She goes to the next shot.
Sees a picture of Sam and
Victoria in the restaurant, although all we see of
Victoria is her back and mane of blond hair.
Hold on Annie's face.
With its stalls of king crab, but otherwise almost
identical in design to the Baltimore marketplace.
Sam and Jonah walk past the fish stand, Sam looking
around, slightly distracted.
JONAH I figure we could go to New
JONAH York, catch the Knicks, and
JONAH since we'd be there anyway,
JONAH obviously we'd go to the Empire
JONAH State Building --
SAM There she is.
As Victoria comes toward them, with a bag full of
groceries.
JONAH Why is she bringing that bag?
SAM She's going to cook something
SAM for us?
VICTORIA Hi, Sam.
VICTORIA And let me guess --
VICTORIA you must be Jonah.
JONAH Hi.
JONAH He should book now because we
JONAH can get an excursion fare.
JONAH Jessica's parents are travel
JONAH agents and --
SAM Not now, Jonah.
Sam, Jonah and Victoria are at the dining room table,
finishing the dinner that Victoria cooked.
SAM We can't finish the job.
SAM She's
SAM on her sixth painter, now she's
SAM thinking maybe she wants the
SAM fireplace rebricked --
VICTORIA I know her pretty well.
VICTORIA Maybe
VICTORIA I could call her --
SAM I've already solved it.
SAM I've
SAM hired a hit man.
Victoria laughs a little too hard.
VICTORIA Oh that is so funny, you are so
VICTORIA funny.
Sam smiles.
Jonah is appalled.
SAM Every time she wants to change
SAM something, she talks in this
SAM little baby voice --
SAM (in a little baby
SAM voice)
SAM "Couldn't you just move the
SAM stairway a teeny tiny bit?"--
Victoria almost dies laughing.
Jonah's eyes narrow to
slits.
JONAH Do you like baseball?
VICTORIA Yes, I do.
VICTORIA In fact, my firm has
VICTORIA box seats for the Mariners.
VICTORIA Why don't we all go next week?
JONAH What about camping?
VICTORIA What about it?
JONAH Do you like it?
VICTORIA I went camping once.
VICTORIA I love to brush my teeth in a
VICTORIA brook and floss with a weed.
JONAH We ought to start camping
JONAH again, Dad.
SAM Okay, tiger.
SAM Time for bed.
JONAH It's only ten o'clock.
SAM Jonah!
JONAH Okay.
SAM Thank Victoria for dinner.
JONAH Thanks for dinner.
JONAH I never saw
JONAH anybody cook potatoes that way.
SAM I'm glad you liked it.
SAM Good
SAM night, Jonah.
They watch as Jonah pads down the hallway.
They're standing at the rail, talking.
Jonah has snuck downstairs and is peeking out the window
at them.
Victoria runs her finger down Sam's arm.
Jonah is horrified.
He dashes over to the phone and begins to dial.
A sleeping Annie and Walter are startled awake by the
ringing of her phone.
ANNIE Hello.
BECKY Turn on your radio!
ANNIE What?
BECKY The kid is on.
BECKY You've got me
BECKY listening to this garbage.
BECKY Go on, turn it on.
WALTER Who is it?
ANNIE Oh, it's just Becky, she's
ANNIE having trouble with Rich again.
ANNIE Hold on, Becky, I'm going
ANNIE downstairs.
She puts the phone on hold and gets out of bed.
As Annie comes in and turns on the radio and picks up
the phone.
JONAH (V.O.) This is a complete disaster.
JONAH (V.O.) wanted him to find a wife, but
JONAH (V.O.) he's got the wrong one --
ANNIE How am I going to explain this
ANNIE to Walter?
BECKY (V.O.) Shhh, listen to this --
Annie takes the portable radio and the telephone
receiver, opens the broom closet and closes herself
inside.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Shouldn't your father be the
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) judge of whether she's right
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) or wrong?
ON JONAH sneaking glances out at Sam and Victoria as he talks.
Victoria puts her arms around Sam's waist and clasps
them behind him.
JONAH Please, please don't make me
JONAH sick.
JONAH He's not sane enough to
JONAH judge anything.
JONAH She's a ho.
JONAH (V.O.) My dad's been captured by a ho.
Suddenly Sam happens to look over to the window.
Jonah
ducks down behind the desk before Sam sees him.
Victoria notices Sam glancing back at the house, aware
that he's concerned about Jonah seeing them.
VICTORIA Is he there?
SAM No.
SAM After he was born, every time
SAM we started to make love, he
SAM would cry.
SAM He had an uncanny
SAM sense of timing.
SAM We really
SAM shouldn't do anything here
SAM anyway.
VICTORIA Absolutely.
VICTORIA Right.
And she moves in to kiss him.
Jonah peeks up over the top of the desk to check if the
coast is clear and is sickened to see them locked in a
kiss.
JONAH Oh God, it's major.
JONAH He's
JONAH kissing her on the lips.
JONAH have to stop this.
ANNIE Come on, Jonah --
BECKY (V.O.) Do something --
MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) Jonah, you can't butt in here.
JONAH Yes, I can.
He hangs up the phone and SCREAMS.
It's Walter.
WALTER Miss Scarlett.
WALTER In the broom
WALTER closet.
WALTER With the radio.
ANNIE I gotta go.
ANNIE I'll see you at
ANNIE work.
ANNIE (she hangs up, turns
ANNIE off radio)
ANNIE Walter, you scared me.
ANNIE Don't
ANNIE ever do that again.
As Sam holds Jonah by the shoulders.
SAM Don't ever do that again.
JONAH I thought I saw a black widow
JONAH spider.
Sam looks at Victoria, shrugs.
Back to Jonah.
SAM What are you doing up?
JONAH I was thirsty.
SAM There's a bathroom upstairs.
JONAH The water tastes better in the
JONAH kitchen.
SAM That's true.
SAM Why is that?
As she and Walter go upstairs to bed.
ANNIE Becky heard this woman on the
ANNIE radio complaining about this
ANNIE guy she was sure was Rick,
ANNIE which meant he was cheating on
ANNIE her.
ANNIE She was completely
ANNIE hysterical.
ANNIE Then it turned out
ANNIE the woman lived in Duluth.
WALTER That doesn't make any sense.
ANNIE I know.
ANNIE It makes no sense at
ANNIE all.
ANNIE Thank God my life is in
ANNIE place.
Walter asleep.
Annie stares up at the ceiling, wide
awake.
Thinking.
Jonah lying on his pillow, staring up at the ceiling,
wide awake.
Thinking.
Jessica is reading the letter from Annie.
She's sitting
at a computer in their travel agency, which is on the
entrance level to a charming Seattle townhouse.
Jonah
sitting there.
JESSICA Write her.
JONAH You think so?
JESSICA It's Y. O. H.
JONAH Yeah.
JONAH What's that?
JESSICA Your only hope.
Annie, at her computer, talking to Becky.
ANNIE I thought I would look into
ANNIE doing a story about those radio
ANNIE shows.
BECKY You'd probably have to go
BECKY somewhere to really look into
BECKY it.
ANNIE Definitely.
Jonah and Jessica at the mailbox.
As Jonah opens the
mailbox and drops the letter in, we hear a SQUEAL OF
BRAKES.
It's Sam's car.
SAM Get in the car right this
SAM minute.
Jonah, about to get in, looks at Jessica.
JESSICA I'll call you later.
Jonah gets in.
SAM Did you call that radio station
SAM again?
JONAH No.
SAM Everyone at work heard you.
JONAH I just called for a second.
SAM Long enough to call Victoria a
SAM ho.
JONAH It's a short word.
SAM This is not a joke.
SAM Thank God
SAM Victoria doesn't know.
SAM It
SAM would really have hurt her
SAM feelings.
JONAH (really getting into
JONAH it)
JONAH If she knew, she'd never
JONAH forgive me.
JONAH It would be
JONAH hopeless for the two of you.
As the car drives off.
SAM (V.O.) Don't open your mouth again.
SAM (V.O.) Ever.
And pull back to reveal:
As Annie and Walter get out of the car, dressed for a
dinner.
WALTER Couldn't you just do a phone
WALTER interview?
ANNIE Not for the kind of place I
ANNIE want to do.
ANNIE I won't be in
ANNIE Chicago that long.
WALTER When you get back, I'll be
WALTER gone --
ANNIE And then I'll see you in New
ANNIE York --
WALTER Okay, okay.
A 747 accelerates down the runway and blasts into the
winter sky.
Annie is looking out the window, preoccupied.
PILOT'S VOICE This is Captain Foster
PILOT'S VOICE welcoming you aboard Flight 132
PILOT'S VOICE to Seattle.
PILOT'S VOICE Our flying time
PILOT'S VOICE today...
ANNIE Do you believe that any lie is
ANNIE a betrayal?
ANNIE That's what Harold
ANNIE Pinter says, but it seems to me
ANNIE it's a very harsh way of
ANNIE drawing the line.
Annie turns back to the window, leaving the seatmate,
who in any case doesn't speak English, completely
mystified.
Jonah is standing out of the way at a departure gate,
watching Sam as Victoria checks in for a flight bound
for Minneapolis.
VICTORIA Can I bring something back for
VICTORIA you?
VICTORIA A souvenir?
VICTORIA Does he like those little snow
VICTORIA scenes?
VICTORIA You know -- you shake them up
VICTORIA and the snow floats down?
Sam looks at Jonah, threateningly.
Be nice or else.
JONAH Sure.
JONAH I'd really like that.
JONAH Thank you so much.
VICTORIA Well...
JONAH I think they're announcing your
JONAH flight.
Sure enough, passengers are starting to board.
SAM He's ten.
VICTORIA He's good at it.
SAM I read an article about this
VICTORIA I read the same article...
SAM It takes time --
VICTORIA Absolutely.
VICTORIA When I come back,
VICTORIA maybe the two of us should
VICTORIA spend some time together, on
VICTORIA our own.
VICTORIA What do you think?
SAM Sure.
SAM Sure.
Victoria waves goodbye and starts toward the jetway.
As Sam watches her go, Jonah looks at him, sticks his
finger in his mouth and pretends to gag.
SAM Jonah, this isn't fair.
SAM You
SAM don't know Victoria.
SAM I hardly
SAM know her myself.
SAM She is, in
SAM fact, a mystery to me.
SAM She
SAM tosses her hair a lot.
SAM Why
SAM does she do this?
SAM I have no
SAM idea.
SAM Is it a twitch?
SAM Does
SAM she need a haircut?
SAM Should she
SAM use barrette so it doesn't
SAM keep falling in her face?
SAM These are things that I'm
SAM willing to get to the bottom
SAM of, and that is why I am dating
SAM her.
SAM That is all I am doing.
SAM I am not marrying her.
SAM Can you
SAM appreciate the difference?
SAM That's what single people do,
SAM they try people on and they see
SAM if they fit.
SAM But nobody fits
SAM perfectly, everyone is an
SAM adjustment.
JONAH Was Mom an adjustment?
SAM I'm never going to meet anyone
SAM who's going to measure up to
SAM your mom in your eyes?
SAM What do
SAM you think?
SAM There's a perfect
SAM woman walking around out there?
At that moment, Annie emerges from the jetway right next
to the one Victoria went into and comes toward us.
SAM There's no such thing as a
SAM perf --
Sam sees Annie immediately, and is instantly struck by
her looks, her fluidity, her poise.
Annie walks right toward Sam, right past him, inches
from him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit.
Sam continues to stare at her.
SAM (to himself, referring
SAM to Annie)
SAM God, she's beautiful.
JONAH (unaware he's talking
JONAH about Annie)
JONAH Victoria?
JONAH She's okay.
Sam and Jonah start toward the exit, Sam trying not to
lose sight of Annie.
JONAH Dad, I was talking to Jessica
JONAH about reincarnation, and she
JONAH thinks that probably you knew
JONAH Annie in another life.
SAM Who is Annie?
JONAH The one who wrote us.
Sam is preoccupied with Annie.
She takes a turn that he
doesn't expect.
He's having trouble keeping up, because
he has to wait for Jonah.
JONAH But Jessica says you and Annie
JONAH never got together in that
JONAH life, and your hearts are like
JONAH puzzles with parts out of them
JONAH and when you get together the
JONAH puzzle's complete.
He's lost Annie in the crowd.
She's nowhere in sight.
SAM God dammit.
A beat, then Sam heads off to the exit.
Jonah follows.
As they walk into the distance --
JONAH The reason I know this and you
JONAH don't is that I'm younger and
JONAH purer so I'm more in touch with
JONAH cosmic forces.
SAM I sincerely hope you are not
SAM going to marry Jessica.
As the shuttle bus drops Annie off at a rental car.
As
she gets in and starts the car.
Annie driving through the streets of Seattle, referring
continually to a map she has spread out on the passenger
seat, trying to navigate her way to the Baldwin houseboat.
Annie drives slowly down the street, looking for the
Baldwins' marina.
She stops, blocking the driveway to
the marina.
ON ANNIE IN HER RENTAL CAR checking the map.
Suddenly she hears a HORN HONKING behind her.
She looks
into the rear-view mirror and sees Sam and Jonah in
their van, anxious for her to move so they can pull into
their driveway.
Recognizing Sam from Wheedle's picture, Annie panics and
speeds away, tires squealing.
Annie's car is parked just outside the rest room.
Annie's in the Ladies' Room, splashing some water on her
face.
She towels it off and looks into the mirror.
ANNIE Hello, Mr. Baldwin?
ANNIE No.
ANNIE Hello, Sam?
ANNIE I'm Annie Reed.
ANNIE I'm Annie Reed.
ANNIE I'm Annie Reed.
ANNIE I'm Annie Reed.
She settles on the matter-of-fact reading.
ANNIE I heard about you calling Dr.
ANNIE Fieldstone, and well, I just
ANNIE happened to be out here on...
ANNIE business...
ANNIE vacation...
ANNIE (losing confidence,
ANNIE ready to pack it in)
ANNIE for no good reason at all...
ANNIE (rallying, businesslike
ANNIE again)
ANNIE business...
ANNIE and I thought I'd
ANNIE drop and...
ANNIE say hello...
ANNIE invite you to lunch...
ANNIE take a shower with you...
ANNIE (embarrassed with all
ANNIE this)
ANNIE shoot myself.
ON ANNIE watching.
She's at a safe distance, across the street
and down some from the marina entrance.
She watches it
for a moment, then gains courage.
She starts to cross
the street to enter the dock.
Annie walks toward Sam's houseboat.
Nervously.
Goes up
to the door.
Adjusts herself quickly and knocks.
No
response.
Let down, she's just about to walk away when
she hears a motor REV UP.
Annie peeks around the side of Sam's houseboat and spots
Sam and Jonah heading out in their dingy.
Annie races back to her car, jumps in and follows the
boat along the seashore drive.
As we see Annie driving along the water as Sam and Jonah
chug along in the water.
They're down at the water's edge, skipping broken
clamshells, like stones, across the surface of the water.
They're laughing, pointing, counting out the number of
skips, arguing over the merits of each throw.
ON ANNIE checking them out from a phone booth next to the Snak Shak.
They're throwing a football.
Jonah catches it and
starts to pretend to score a touchdown, dodging and
feinting.
Sam tackles him and they tumble together on
the beach.
CLOSE ON ANNIE watching.
The purity and innocence of this little scene
-- a father and son at play -- is affecting her more
than she ever could have imagined.
Their LAUGHTER
filters up to her.
Right to her heart.
ANNIE (V.O.) I watched him play with his son
ANNIE (V.O.) at the beach.
Annie's on the phone with Becky.
We cut back and forth
between them.
BECKY (V.O.) Did you talk to him?
ANNIE I couldn't do it.
ANNIE How did I
ANNIE get here?
Becky on the phone in bed.
And cut back and forth.
BECKY You told a lie and got on a
BECKY plane.
ANNIE That's not what I mean.
ANNIE I'm going back over there
ANNIE tomorrow and talk to him.
ANNIE am.
BECKY Okay.
BECKY Good.
BECKY Goodbye.
ANNIE Becky?
BECKY What?
ANNIE Is this crazy?
BECKY No.
BECKY That's the weirdest part
BECKY about it.
ANNIE Thank you.
ANNIE I love you.
BECKY I love you, too.
ANNIE Good night.
Annie hangs up the phone.
She turns off the light.
Moonlight coming through the window.
Hold on her.
Annie parks across from the marina, starts to get out.
Sam's van pulls into a parking space.
Jonah in the
front with Sam.
They're diagonally across a four-lane
street.
As they start to get groceries out of the car.
Annie watching.
This is it.
No chickening out this time.
She's come three thousand miles, told lies, the whole
thing.
It's now or never.
Sam and Jonah start toward the gate to the dock.
Annie starts to cross the street, gathering courage and
rightness with every step.
But she STOPS DEAD WHEN SHE SEES:
SUZY who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at
the gate to the marina -- waving, smiling a mile wide --
beckoning Sam and Jonah home like a military wife whose
boys have just come back from the front.
Sam and Jonah
are overjoyed to see her.
Jonah breaks into a run,
nearly leaping into Suzy's waiting arms -- as Sam brings
up the rear, picking up Jonah's sodas which he dropped
when he started running.
She comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street.
In shock.
The scene in front of her is too horrible to
bear.
Sam catches up.
Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious
than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam
and hugs them both.
SAM God, it's wonderful to see you.
SAM Where's Greg?
SUZY He's over at the boat show.
SUZY He'll be by later.
SUZY It's so beautiful here.
There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about
this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the
middle of the street.
A car HORN blares at her...
all
she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded.
She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees --
A TAXICAB coming right at her, horn BLARING, tires SQUEALING.
Annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van
bearing down from the opposite direction.
She steps
back to the middle line.
The cab goes into a skid.
Annie freezes.
Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on.
The cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA.
Annie screams.
The cab stops inches from her body.
The van in the
other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well.
ON SAM responding.
He runs from the gate toward the near-
accident.
ON THE CAB DRIVER getting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the
sidewalk.
DRIVER Lady, what the hell are you
DRIVER doing?
Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster,
hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond.
Stunned, she
turns to see Sam on the other side of the street.
Their
eyes meet.
Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw
in the airport.
SAM Hello.
ANNIE Hello.
Annie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything
that's happened, bolts for her car.
Sam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is
coming past and he can't cross the street.
Annie gets
into her car, starts and pulls away.
Sam stands there,
deflated.
ANNIE (V.O.) How could I have been such an
ANNIE (V.O.) idiot?
Becky's car driving toward Annie's house.
BECKY You were standing in the middle
BECKY of the street?
ANNIE You know that dream where
ANNIE you're walking down the street
ANNIE naked and everyone is looking
ANNIE at you?
BECKY I love that dream.
ANNIE That was nothing compared to
ANNIE this humiliation, nothing.
BECKY But he saw you, right?
ANNIE He said hello.
As Annie leads the way to her door, from Becky's car.
BECKY And what did you say?
Annie takes the mail from the mailbox on her way to the
door.
ANNIE All I could think of to say was
ANNIE hello.
And pull back to reveal:
Becky and Annie looking at the television.
BECKY It's a sign --
ANNIE It's a sign I've watched this
ANNIE movie too many times.
ANNIE I'm so stupid.
ANNIE From the minute
ANNIE I listen to that stupid program
ANNIE on the radio, I've been a
ANNIE complete jerk.
She starts absently going through the mail, throwing
almost all of it away without even opening it.
BECKY You don't know who she was,
BECKY Annie --
ANNIE I saw her.
ANNIE She looked just
ANNIE like this --
She shows Becky the photo of Victoria and Sam having
dinner.
BECKY This is a photo of hair.
ANNIE Well, it's the same woman.
ANNIE And
ANNIE he was crazy about her.
ANNIE What is this?
ANNIE This is from Seattle.
She opens the letter.
Reads it.
Looks up at Becky.
ANNIE Becky?
BECKY So I mailed your letter.
ANNIE "Dear Annie: Thanks for your
ANNIE letter.
ANNIE It was great.
ANNIE We're
ANNIE very excited about meeting you
ANNIE in New York on Valentine's Day
ANNIE and seeing if we are M.F.E.O.
ANNIE Sleepless in Seattle."
ANNIE Made for each other.
A long beat.
BECKY It's cute.
BECKY It's like a little
BECKY clue.
Annie looks at her balefully.
BECKY So he can't write.
BECKY Big deal.
BECKY I mean, verbal ability is a
BECKY highly overrated thing in a
BECKY guy, and our pathetic need for
BECKY it is what gets us into so much
BECKY trouble.
ANNIE I'm going to run back to
ANNIE Walter's arms, if he's still
ANNIE have me.
BECKY What about the letter?
ANNIE It doesn't mean anything.
ANNIE It
ANNIE was written before I went out
ANNIE there.
ANNIE Before the ho.
She puts the letter on an ashtray, takes a match and
lights it.
They both watch it burn.
And pull back to reveal:
A fire is blazing in the wood-burning stove.
Suzy is
sitting with her husband Greg and Sam.
Jonah is in
evidence, curled up on the couch under some blankets,
asleep.
On the table near the couch is red construction
paper for valentines, doilies, magic markers, etc.
SUZY You saw her in the airport and
SUZY then here?
SAM I tried to talk to her...
SAM It was like I knew her.
SAM Weird.
GREG Well, at least you're out there
GREG seeing people again.
GREG That's
GREG terrific.
SAM Well, just one really.
SUZY How's Jonah taking it?
SAM It'll take him a while to come
SAM around.
SAM A month ago he called
SAM one of those radio call-in
SAM shows and told them I needed a
SAM wife --
SUZY You're kidding --
SAM Now that I'm seeing someone,
SAM it's a whole other thing.
ON JONAH he's not asleep after all.
He's been listening all
along.
SAM He's become obsessed with
SAM some woman who wrote me --
GREG Are you serious?
SAM She wants to meet me at the top
SAM of the Empire State Building.
SUZY It's a little derivative.
SAM What do you mean?
SUZY "An Affair To Remember."
SUZY Did
SUZY you ever see it?
SUZY Cary Grant
SUZY and Deborah Kerr.
SUZY Before that
SUZY it was called "Love Affair With
SUZY Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
GREG Women love this movie.
On Jonah, listening.
SUZY They met at the Empire State
SUZY Building, only they didn't.
SUZY Never mind.
GREG What kind of person would write
GREG to someone they heard on the
GREG radio?
SAM I got hundreds of letters from
SAM women all over the country --
GREG Desperate women --
SUZY Just because someone's looking
SUZY for a nice guy doesn't make
SUZY them desperate.
GREG How about rapacious and love-
GREG starved?
SUZY No.
GREG It is easier to be killed by a
GREG terrorist --
SUZY It is not --
GREG Right, right.
Suzy's irritated.
SAM Anyway, Victoria's nice.
SUZY Would you follow her through an
SUZY airport?
SAM Look, I met somebody.
SAM She's
SAM good, and capable and smart.
SAM We hit it off.
SAM We can't spend
SAM your life chasing after
SAM fantasies.
Jonah is devastated by the realization that his dad is
serious about Victoria.
The door to his bedroom opens.
Annie walks in.
She's wearing a white men's shirt.
ANNIE Hi.
SAM Hi.
SAM So far so good.
SAM So.
SAM What
SAM should we talk about?
SAM How
SAM insecure we were in high
SAM school.
SAM Shirley Votypka, the
SAM first girl I ever felt up.
SAM Health.
SAM What about health?
SAM Did you know that eating six
SAM macadamia nuts is the
SAM equivalent of eating a steak?
ANNIE Shhhh --
She unbuttons her shirt.
And they kiss.
FREEZE FRAME on the kiss.
It becomes the silhouette of
a man and a woman kissing.
The silhouette of a man and a woman kissing on a red box
of Valentine's Day chocolates and now we see:
A few quick shot of Valentine's Day in Baltimore: shop
windows lined with candy displays of red satin hearts,
lacy Valentine cards, red roses in elaborate floral
arrangements, old ladies selling chocolates, young
ladies selling perfume.
A red Valentine's envelope is being tossed on a desk,
and pull back to reveal:
Annie at work.
She looks at the card and opens it.
It's from Walter.
She smiles.
Looks up.
There's
Becky.
BECKY You're going to miss the train.
ANNIE No, I'm not.
ANNIE (she starts assembling
ANNIE her things)
BECKY What are your plans in New
BECKY York?
ANNIE We're going to the Rainbow Room
ANNIE and the symphony tomorrow night.
BECKY I love the symphony.
ANNIE I hate it.
ANNIE (she stands to go,
ANNIE starts toward the
ANNIE elevator)
ANNIE I'm so happy, Becky.
ANNIE Finally I
ANNIE feel happy.
ANNIE This is right.
ANNIE This is real.
ANNIE Everything else
ANNIE is what happens when you watch
ANNIE too many movies and completely
ANNIE lose sight of what counts.
ANNIE (as she steps into
ANNIE elevator)
ANNIE Please don't tell anyone about
ANNIE what happened.
ANNIE "Sleepless in
ANNIE Seattle" is history.
Annie through the train window as the train starts to
move out of the station.
The map we saw at the beginning of the movie, as the
light dims in Baltimore and a light goes on in New York.
Annie steps out of a cab.
Walter opens the door to a beautiful suite.
A bouquet
of flowers sits on the desk.
A bucket of champagne.
Annie throws herself into his arms.
Walter sneezes.
And pull back to reveal that it's a shot from "An Affair
To Remember."
And pull back to reveal:
JONAH is watching with his little girlfriend JESSICA,
who's crying.
JESSICA This is the best movie I've
JESSICA ever seen in my life.
JONAH I don't get it.
JESSICA You have to go to her, Jonah.
JESSICA You have to find her.
Jonah nods.
But he isn't sure how he's going to do it.
JONAH Do you know how much it costs
JONAH to go to New York?
JESSICA Nobody knows.
JESSICA It changes
JESSICA practically every day.
JESSICA How
JESSICA much money do you have?
JONAH Eighty dollars.
JESSICA I have forty-two.
JESSICA So that
JESSICA would definitely cover
JESSICA taxicabs, I think.
JONAH But how am I going to get
JONAH there?
JESSICA'S MOTHER Honey, I'm going out for a few
JESSICA'S MOTHER minutes.
JESSICA'S MOTHER (sticking her head in
JESSICA'S MOTHER the door to the living
JESSICA'S MOTHER room)
JESSICA'S MOTHER Could you keep an eye on things
JESSICA'S MOTHER out front till I get back?
Jessica looks over at Jonah.
JESSICA Sure.
Jessica is working on the computer.
She punches Jonah's
name into it.
JESSICA Do you want an aisle or a
JESSICA window seat?
JONAH Window.
JESSICA Do you want a fruit plate?
JONAH I don't know.
JONAH Do I?
JESSICA I'd rather die than eat on an
JESSICA airplane.
JESSICA I'm telling them you're twelve
JESSICA so you can fly unaccompanied
JESSICA and they won't make you be
JESSICA carried around by a stewardess
JESSICA and everything.
Jonah nods.
Now Jessica takes a ticket form out of the desk and
starts to fill it out for Jonah.
- DAY formed by two dancers bending over backwards, awash in
pink light and spotlighted in white.
Walter and Annie are among a few other people -- couples
mostly -- looking in the windows.
Each one a variation
on the heart motif.
They move to a window -- "Broken
Heart" -- burnished metal, with tow cherubs flying out
of the wound in the middle.
ON WALTER AND ANNIE'S REFLECTION in the Broken Heart window.
They're both in their own worlds.
Then they both start
to speak at once.
They stop.
Annie looks at Walter.
ANNIE You go.
WALTER Ever since Christmas, you've
WALTER been different.
WALTER Kind of
WALTER distracted, distant.
WALTER But I
WALTER feel like you're coming back
WALTER from wherever you were.
ANNIE I am.
ANNIE I was just...
ANNIE I just got...
ANNIE think I got nervous.
ANNIE It's
ANNIE normal, right?
ANNIE Don't you ever
ANNIE feel nervous about, you know?
WALTER What?
ANNIE About forever.
WALTER No.
ANNIE Well, I did.
ANNIE And you know what
ANNIE I think?
ANNIE I think that it was
ANNIE almost...
ANNIE too perfect.
As Annie and Walter walk through the jewelry department
to the elevator.
ANNIE I started to wonder whether we
ANNIE were the human equivalent of
ANNIE two rights making a wrong, you
ANNIE know?
Walter has no idea what she means, but he's completely
good-natured about it.
Annie and Walter are walking around the floor, followed
by a SALESWOMAN who is carrying a large white card on
which she is noting their selections.
ANNIE It was like kismet but not, if
ANNIE you see what I mean.
Walter's brow furrows slightly.
ANNIE You have to grow up.
ANNIE You can't
ANNIE have all these adolescent
ANNIE dreams about how exciting your
ANNIE life is going to be --
Walter starting to look puzzled.
ANNIE Don't hate me but I love this
ANNIE pattern.
WALTER You couldn't.
ANNIE I do.
WALTER It's just like my grandmother's
WALTER china.
SALESWOMAN How many place settings should
SALESWOMAN I put down?
ANNIE & WALTER Ten.
Walter beams at her.
WALTER Exactly.
WALTER Eight is too few and
WALTER twelve is too many.
The SALESWOMAN writes a "10" on the big sheet of paper.
As Annie and Walter come out of the elevator on the
ground floor and WALTER stops for a moment at the
Jewelry Repair department, reappears with a little blue
Tiffany's box he gives to Annie.
Annie opens it.
Inside is a lovely antique diamond ring.
ANNIE Walter.
WALTER It was my mother's.
ANNIE It's so beautiful.
ANNIE It's just
ANNIE what I would have picked out if
ANNIE I'd had every ring in the world
ANNIE to choose from.
ANNIE (as she slips the ring
ANNIE onto her finger)
ANNIE You see what I mean.
ANNIE There are
ANNIE people who would like a
ANNIE relationship to be full of
ANNIE surprises, but I am not one of
ANNIE them.
ANNIE (as she starts out the
ANNIE door with Walter
ANNIE behind, thinking about
ANNIE what she has just
ANNIE said)
ANNIE Surprises are highly overrated.
As they go out the door to:
As they start down the street and go off into the
distance.
ANNIE Promise me something, Walter.
ANNIE Promise me you will never have
ANNIE a surprise party for me.
ANNIE Ever.
ANNIE You know what happens, you walk
ANNIE in the door in some horrible
ANNIE sweater you put on that morning,
ANNIE and there are hundreds of people
ANNIE in their best clothes shouting
ANNIE "Surprise!"
Sam's got a suitcase on the bed, packing.
Jonah is
standing in the doorway, watching.
He goes to his desk looking for something but can't find
it.
He tries a few drawers.
SAM Have you seen my wallet?
JONAH It might be in the kitchen.
Sam doesn't remember leaving it in the kitchen.
SAM I'm only going to be away one
SAM night, okay, and Clarise will
SAM be here.
SAM You'll have a swell
SAM time.
SAM You'll watch a little
SAM Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm
SAM Street 12, I'll never know.
JONAH Are you going with her?
SAM Yes.
Jonah walks out of Sam's bedroom and we hear the door to
his bedroom slam shut.
Starting to boil.
He walks into --
And open the door to Jonah's room.
SAM I have to have a life.
SAM I have
SAM to do things that I want with
SAM people my own age.
SAM It's none
SAM of your business who I am going
SAM out with.
SAM I don't give a good
SAM goddam if you're angry --
JONAH (holding up Annie's
JONAH letter)
JONAH This is the one I like.
Sam starts back to his bedroom.
SAM I don't care who you like.
SAM It's who I like.
SAM But the truth
SAM is you're never going to like
SAM anyone because it isn't your
SAM mother.
Sam throws a pair of socks into the suitcase.
JONAH Fine.
JONAH I won't say anything.
JONAH You can marry Count Dracula.
SAM Thank you, Jonah.
SAM But the
SAM point is, I am not asking
SAM permission.
JONAH What's wrong with Annie?
SAM (emphasizing every
SAM word)
SAM Shut up.
Jonah appears at the doorway.
JONAH Shut up?
JONAH Shut up???
JONAH Mom never
JONAH did that.
JONAH Mom never said shut
JONAH up to me.
JONAH Mom never yelled at
JONAH me.
SAM This conversation is finished.
JONAH You said we could go to New
JONAH York.
SAM Did not.
JONAH Did too.
SAM I can't know what I said, but
SAM we're not going.
JONAH (crossing his arms
JONAH across his chest)
JONAH I'm not leaving this room until
JONAH you say yes.
SAM Get out.
JONAH No.
SAM Goddammit, I am sick of this
Sam picks Jonah up and carries him kicking and screaming
into:
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT and into:
JONAH Put me down.
JONAH I hate you, I
JONAH hate you --
He throws Jonah on the bed.
Jonah in tears.
SAM I'm sick of this phony
SAM melodramatic bullshit.
SAM I'm
SAM sick of it.
He leaves the room and slams the door.
Jonah weeping as Sam goes back to his bedroom.
The sound of Jonah weeping.
Sam sits down on the bed, wiped out.
Hold on him.
As Clarise the babysitter arrives at the houseboat.
Sam and Clarise in the hallway outside Jonah's door.
SAM Jonah?
SAM Clarise is here, okay?
SAM And I'm leaving.
No response.
SAM Jonah?
SAM He's probably still asleep.
He opens the door gently to the room.
Jonah's gone.
Sam looks in the bathroom: no Jonah.
In the main cabin.
The back deck.
Out onto the docks.
Looking all up and
down.
Clarise coming down the deck -- she's apparently
been looking in the neighborhood.
As she shakes her
head no, Sam goes to the bicycle shed.
Jonah's bike
still there.
Sam stands on the deck.
We see a group of people filing off an airport shuttle
bus.
The sign in front rotates from "Airport" back to
"Marina."
Jonah comes down the stairs and steps off with his
Mariners backpack.
He just stands there a beat, looking
around.
Then he goes through the glass doors.
The TICKET CLERK turns back to the counter.
TICKET CLERK Next.
Jonah steps forward, with his ticket.
Jessica is sitting defiantly in a chair in the middle of
the living room.
She is being interrogated but she is
not going to talk.
There's a clock on the mantel.
Sam
is in the room with Jessica's mother and father.
JESSICA'S MOTHER Jessica, this is not
JESSICA'S MOTHER acceptable.
JESSICA'S FATHER If you don't tell us right now,
JESSICA'S FATHER right this minute, I'm going to
JESSICA'S FATHER kill you.
Jessica rolls her eyes.
She looks over the clock on the mantel.
As it ticks
to 8:30:
JESSICA He's on his way to New York.
JESSICA'S MOTHER What?
SAM How?
JESSICA (the child of travel
JESSICA agents)
JESSICA United 597.
Jessica's mother and father are horrified.
JESSICA'S MOTHER Jessica!
SAM When does it leave?
JESSICA'S FATHER Eight-thirty.
Everyone looks over at the clock.
It says 8:31.
Jessica smiles.
Driving to the airport.
As his car takes the airport exit.
A stewardess bends affectionately over Jonah, ensconced
in the first-class section.
He's got his backpack on
his lap and he's holding it.
STEWARDESS Here you go...
STEWARDESS here's a nice pin
STEWARDESS for you, for flying with us.
JONAH (completely unmoved,
JONAH but polite)
JONAH Thank you.
STEWARDESS You're welcome.
STEWARDESS Can I take
STEWARDESS that for you?
JONAH (clutching it even
JONAH tighter)
JONAH No.
INT. AIRPORT TICKET COUNTER - ON SAM - DAY at the reservations desk.
Desperation.
SAM He's about this high, 90
SAM pounds, never combs his hair,
SAM Mariner's hat --
AIRLINE CLERK Anyone check in a
AIRLINE CLERK unaccompanied minor on the New
AIRLINE CLERK York flight?
FIRST CLASS TICKET CLERK I did.
Sam closes his eyes.
SAM I'll kill him.
SAM I have to get to New York as
SAM fast as I can.
AIRLINE CLERK We can get you on a flight to
AIRLINE CLERK Chicago and you can change
AIRLINE CLERK planes --
Starting to punch information into the computer.
AIRLINE CLERK How will you be paying for
AIRLINE CLERK this?
SAM American Express.
SAM (there's no American
SAM Express card in his
SAM wallet)
SAM Visa.
SAM I really am going to kill him.
As Sam comes out of the plane from Seattle and dashes
through the concourse, managing to arrive at the plane
for New York at the very last moment.
As Jonah comes out of the plane from Seattle and looks
up to see which way to go.
He looks very small.
Big
New York passengers in a hurry whiz by with their
carryons dangerously flying at their sides.
Jonah stands in a taxi line.
Jonah sits down in the back seat.
Looks up.
A big
bruiser of a CAB DRIVER leans back over the seat, sizing
Jonah up.
TAXI DRIVER Where to?
JONAH Empire State Building.
Sam is in an aisle seat.
He closes his eyes and
squeezes them tight.
SAM Come on...
SAM come on...
SAM come on...
It looks magnificent in the waning afternoon light.
CABBIE'S VOICE There it is.
We are watching from:
INT. A TAXICAB where Jonah, with his head out the window, regards the
building with awe.
CABBIE What are you gonna do there,
CABBIE spit off the top?
JONAH No.
JONAH I'm gonna meet...
JONAH (trying to figure out
JONAH what to call her)
JONAH my mother.
Walter and Annie walking toward their table with the
Annie sits down, looks at the view.
Walter starts to
sit, revealing a spectacular view of the EMPIRE STATE
BUILDING directly behind him.
Annie's smile fades.
WALTER Is something wrong.
Annie shakes her head.
MAITRE D' May I get you a drink?
WALTER Some champagne?
ANNIE Fine, fine.
Walter glances back over his shoulder.
WALTER Beautiful view, isn't it?
ANNIE Walter, there's something I
ANNIE have to tell you --
As Sam rushes out of the terminal.
Desperate.
A cab pulls up.
Sam bolts to the head of the line and
muscles his way into the cab.
The other people in line
are irate.
SAM Sorry, this is an emergency.
The cab pulls out to a chorus of verbal abuse.
SAM (V.O.) Empire State Building.
Jonah, carrying his backpack, walks through the majestic
lobby and follows the arrow to the Observation Deck.
Looking down on the observation deck.
The city below.
The tiny figure of Jonah walks into the middle of the
deck.
Looks around.
Sam's cab speeds across the bridge and into Manhattan,
heading for the Empire State Building.
Jonah is going to take the bull by the horns.
He walks
up to a likely-looking WOMAN.
JONAH Hi, I'm Jonah.
JONAH Are you Annie?
WOMAN #1 No.
WOMAN #1 I'm Cynthia.
He spies another unattached woman.
JONAH Excuse me, are you Annie?
A helicopter shot of Annie talking animatedly to Walter.
And pull back to reveal that the Rainbow Room is
actually being seen by Jonah through a viewscope in:
Jonah is looking through the viewfinder.
He turns
around, forlorn.
He takes off his backpack and is about
to sit down next to it when Sam bolts into the
observation deck.
Jonah leaps into his arms.
SAM You're my family.
SAM You're all
SAM I've got.
SAM What if something
SAM happened to you?
Sam's eyes well up.
Jonah starts to cry.
SAM What if I couldn't get to you?
JONAH I was scared of what you were
JONAH gonna do.
SAM When I found you?
JONAH If I didn't go.
SAM Listen, have I ever done
SAM anything really stupid?
JONAH No.
SAM I mean, so far, have I screwed
SAM it up for you?
JONAH No.
The two of them hold each other tight.
After a beat:
SAM I can't believe you flew first
SAM class.
JONAH It was all they had.
Annie and Walter.
There's champagne in their glasses,
but neither of them has drunk a drop.
ANNIE I don't know what to say about
ANNIE it, Walter.
ANNIE It was a form of
ANNIE temporary insanity.
ANNIE But I had
ANNIE to tell you about it because --
WALTER -- it was a betrayal.
ANNIE Yes.
ANNIE But it wasn't really.
ANNIE It
ANNIE was just...
WALTER So what happened?
ANNIE I told you.
ANNIE Nothing --
WALTER At the top of the Empire State
WALTER Building --
ANNIE I'm not at the top of the
ANNIE Empire State Building.
ANNIE I'm
ANNIE here.
WALTER Not really.
WALTER Look, Annie, I love you.
WALTER Let's
WALTER leave that out of it.
WALTER I don't
WALTER want to be someone you're
WALTER settling for.
WALTER I don't want to
WALTER be someone anyone settles for.
WALTER I have a life insurance policy,
WALTER I'm fully invested in growth
WALTER stocks, I have a paid
WALTER subscription to Home Rox
WALTER Office, I have no sexual
WALTER diseases, I have been steadily
WALTER employed in a part of the
WALTER economy that isn't soft, I have
WALTER expectation in the way of
WALTER inherited wealth, I dress
WALTER nicely, I am a member of the
WALTER private sector, an independent
WALTER voter, I don't watch Monday
WALTER Night Football, the only thing
WALTER wrong with me is that I am
WALTER allergic to wheat,
WALTER strawberries, penicillin,
WALTER pollen, nuts and wool.
WALTER There
WALTER are plenty of women who see me
WALTER as the brass ring.
WALTER If you
WALTER don't -- marriage is hard
WALTER enough without bringing such
WALTER low expectations into it, isn't
WALTER it?
Annie is nodding.
She wipes a tear from her face.
ANNIE Oh, Walter.
ANNIE I don't deserve
ANNIE you.
WALTER I think that's what I'm saying.
Slowly, gingerly, Annie slips the engagement ring off
her finger and hands it to Walter.
No bitterness here.
Both of them trying to be gentle
with each other.
ANNIE You okay?
WALTER Yes.
WALTER Some people will do anything to
WALTER get out of going to a symphony.
This breaks the tension.
Both of them smiles.
ANNIE Oh!
WALTER What?
ANNIE Look!
Walter turns to look over his shoulder at what Annie
sees:
A huge pink and white heart.
Walter turns back to Annie.
WALTER Go for it.
And as Annie's heart leaps and she's about to bolt.
As Annie comes out to the street and hails a cab.
As it screeches off toward Fifth Ave.
The lights are on all over the city.
The crowd has thinned out considerably.
Jonah and Sam
are among the last people left.
They gaze out at the
twinkling lights and the ever-darkening sky.
ELEVATOR OPERATOR Last call.
ELEVATOR OPERATOR Closing time.
Jonah looks at Sam.
JONAH This is pretty dumb, wasn't
JONAH it?
Sam shrugs.
SAM Big deal.
After a beat.
SAM Maybe we'll get a dog when we
SAM get back.
JONAH Okay.
SAM What do you mean, okay?
SAM Wouldn't you like a dog?
JONAH Sure.
Sam puts his arm around him, they start toward the
elevator.
SAM Let's go home.
Annie's cab stuck in traffic.
As Annie gets out of the cab.
She's breaking into a hard run toward the Empire State
Building.
Annie sprints in and over to Information Booth.
INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON Sorry, ma'am, but the elevators
INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON are closed.
ANNIE No.
ANNIE Please.
ANNIE I really need to
ANNIE get up there.
INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON We're closing up.
INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON No more runs
INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON tonight.
Annie takes a deep breath.
She's hit the end of the
road.
She turns to go but then turns back.
ANNIE Listen, can I just take a look?
ANNIE Maybe...
ANNIE maybe...
ANNIE There's
ANNIE someone I was supposed to
ANNIE meet...
ANNIE He's probably not
ANNIE there, but if I don't at least
ANNIE look I'll always wonder about
ANNIE it.
The Information Booth Person looks at her.
INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON Cary Grant, right?
ANNIE You know that movie?
INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON One of my wife's favorites.
After a few beat the elevator door opens on a very
empty platform.
ELEVATOR MAN Sorry, ma'am.
ELEVATOR MAN Empty.
Annie slowly walks out.
ANNIE Can I take a minute?
ELEVATOR MAN Go ahead.
She sighs.
Heads for the telescopes.
Looks out at the
twinkling lights below.
She casually turns the telescope and suddenly sees
something on the floor.
Jonah's Seattle Mariners backpack.
She picks it up.
She realizes that it might be...
could be...
and opens it.
Inside is a toothbrush and
Jonah's teddy bear.
As she takes out the bear the other
elevator DINGS.
Annie looks up as Jonah and Sam exit the elevator.
JONAH I left it near the...
And they stop.
There she is.
There they are.
Sam
can't believe it.
It's the mystery woman.
SAM It's you.
ANNIE It's me?
SAM The one in the street.
SAM chased after you.
JONAH Are you Annie?
ANNIE Yes.
You're Annie too?
She smiles awkwardly.
ANNIE (indicating the
ANNIE backpack)
ANNIE Is this yours?
Jonah walks over to her.
He puts his hand out.
She
shakes it solemnly.
JONAH I'm Jonah.
JONAH That's my dad.
JONAH His name is
JONAH Sam.
ANNIE Hi, Jonah.
ANNIE Sam.
ANNIE (indicating the teddy
ANNIE bear)
ANNIE And who is this?
JONAH Howard.
ANNIE Howard.
Sam nods.
Smiling.
Starting to put it all together.
Annie smiles.
Still nervous.
No one knows what to do
next.
Just then, one of the elevator operators CLEARS
SAM We better go.
Annie nods.
Sam holds out his hand.
SAM Shall we?
Annie slips her hand into his.
It feels comfortable,
natural, right.
ANNIE Sam?
He looks at her.
ANNIE It's nice to meet you.
On Annie.
On Sam.
On Jonah.
He makes a triumphant little double-fist
gesture to himself as the elevator doors close.
WE SEE THE BUILDING from above, all lit up, a romantic
confection, the world's largest Valentine.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see the United States
spread out before us, with lights twinkling everywhere.
