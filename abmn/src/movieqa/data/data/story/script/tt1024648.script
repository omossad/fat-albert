The familiar logo WARNER BROS.
PRESENTS COMES UP.
After a beat, it is consumed by FIRE.
It becomes AN AMERICAN FLAG, BURNING in the street.
Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds chanting Magbar Carter!
Magbar Ahmrika!? Fists in the air.
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full chador.
Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of Ayatollah Khomeini.
PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime.
Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH? -- JUSTICE FOR MURDER.? A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as bystanders than peacekeepers.
A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH.
An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera.
From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of the protest.
There are three primary buildings on campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.
We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.
Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars.
Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the gate, is BOB ANDERS, late 40s-50s, a consular officer.
ARGO - Final 2.
BOB ANDERS Carnival's bigger today.
BOB ANDERS MARK LIJEK, 29, a consular officer, joins Anders at the window.
Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something simple happens.
A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate and makes it to the other side.
And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot.
This isn't archive footage anymore.
We're looking at the POV of TOM AHERN, 48, the CIA station chief here.
From a pillbox on the embassy campus, SGT.
ROCKY SICKMANN, a young MARINE, can also see the protestors break across the lawn.
MARINE SGT. SICKMANN ...
MARINE SGT. SICKMANN Fort Apache is breached -- please advise --
The PROTEST in front of the gate is getting rowdier -- its energy and numbers swelling.
A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk, organized, all bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to the front of the protest -- WOMEN raise a banner.
It's a signal.
As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates.
A WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT -- who gets to work on the CHAINS holding the gate
When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed PISTOL in his clothes.
More STUDENTS climbing the wall -- dropping the 12 feet to the other side, one after another.
ARGO - Final 3.
But a moment later no more climbing is required, because the GATE CHAIN IS CUT and protestors FLOOD through the embassy gates, a human dam breaking --
Mounting chaos in here, the nerve center of the embassy.
Everyone on a different phone.
It's like an emergency room where the patient is the whole building.
ANN SWIFT, 31, Deputy Political Officer, has the phone by her ear -- trying to hear reports from D.C.
ANN SWIFT There are hundreds of people out
No, thousands...
There are
Mark Lijek and Bob Anders look out windows, nervous, but not like the Iranian VISA APPLICANTS who are close to panic.
BOB ANDERS Are these supposed to be bulletproof?
MARK LIJEK Well, they've never been tested.
Six MARINES watch images from closed-circuit television cameras on chunky 1970's monitors.
Crowds of protestors from every part of the embassy campus.
AL GOLACINSKI, 30, chief of security for the embassy, shouts into a radio.
ARGO - Final 4.
AL GOLACINSKI Marines to Number One -- FALL
PROTESTORS come running, turning the corner to reach the building.
They use bats and crowbars to smash the windows of the building.
BOB ANDERS Can we get some fucking police please?
One by one, the security monitors are going black -- or smashed.
The Marines stare.
An IRANIAN POLICE CAPTAIN smokes a cigarette, watching the mayhem, impassive.
MARINES are putting on armor, gas masks, riot gear.
AL GOLACINSKI gs down the line reminding them of protocol.
AL GOLACINSKI Don't shoot.
AL GOLACINSKI You don't want to be the sonofabitch who started a war -
AL GOLACINSKI They need an hour to burn the classified -- Hold.
AL GOLACINSKI You shoot one person, they'll kill every one of us in here.
PROTESTORS, now on the embassy grounds, carry banners.
ARGO - Final 5.
La ilaha ilallah -- A WOMAN IN A CHADOR uses her own radio.
Some of them ring around the building, holding hands and chanting.
Some carry AUTOMATIC WEAPONS openly.
Tear gas as last resort ONLY -- I repeat, only if your life is under threat!
Gallegos and Sickmann hear Golacinski's admonition, but PUMP TEAR GAS out a window onto protestors below despite it.
One cannister after another.
Now the five in the consulate are joined by LEE SCHATZ, 32, an agricultural attache.
J STAFFORD -- We're not going out in this --
We are in the only building with an exit direct to the street.
We need to GO -- The SOUNDS OF MARINES barking at one another over the radio.
They look out a small WINDOW to see a MOB outside.
AL GOLACINSKI I'm going outside.
ARGO - Final 6.
Why?
AL GOLACINSKI To reason with them.
AL GOLACINSKI Marines open the Chancery door, with a look --
FRED KUPKE, 34, communications officer, is shouting at staffers who pile up documents for the shredders --
Just everything.
Don't sort it --
ANN SWIFT -- NONE, there are no police --
Al Golacinski steps out onto the steps and immediately there is shouting, and a protestor puts a GUN to his head -- blindfolds him -- PUSHING AL'S head to the ground...
CORA LIJEK -- Second floor -- anyone who can hear this -- we need help -- As we MOVE DOWN the line of desks, J STAFFORD is also on a radio repeating the same in FARSI -- Others PACK things.
MARINES and STAFFERS -- including TOM AHERN -- RUN down the hall, pushing a cart of items to secure.
They reach the security locker -- code the door -- and enter the locker, heading to the INCINERATOR to begin destroying classified material --
Golacinski HELD UP TO THE DOOR -- GUN TO HIS HEAD.
He starts to panic.
ARGO - Final 7.
AL GOLACINSKI Let me in!
AL GOLACINSKI Jesus Christ!
AL GOLACINSKI Open the fucking door!
AL GOLACINSKI The Marines OPEN THE CHANCERY DOOR -- PROTESTERS POUR IN.
ANN SWIFT -- Washington on flash -- Get Ops -- get a line -- We hear -- The POUNDING of footsteps on the roof.
ANN SWIFT They look up.
Protestors RUNNING on the roof of the consulate building.
Several stop to try and RIP off a vent cover using CLUBS and PIPES.
THOUSANDS are now on the grounds of the embassy and they continue to swarm through the gates.
The student with the SUPER 8 continues to film it all.
Also filming, a NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER with a 16 mm camera.
Smoking cannisters of TEAR GAS, people hurling them.
A protestor lights a paper on fire to ward off the sting of the gas --
STAFFERS using pieces of machines to destroy other machines -- any embassy equipment that might function -- Then...
screams.
The lights have gone out.
The power has been cut.
AHERN destroys the cryptography keys -- box-sized hard drives -- while BILL DAUGHERTY, 33, tosses stacks of papers into an electrical furnace.
ARGO - Final 8.
BILL DAUGHERTY Well, Tom.
BILL DAUGHERTY You wanted to see the world...
BILL DAUGHERTY The furnace makes a LOUD CHUNK and stops.
BILL DAUGHERTY They both hold their looks for a beat.
BILL DAUGHERTY Are you kidding me?
Get the shredder.
BROTHER ALI, 20s, one of the student leaders, shouts as he holds a cloth near his face to protect from tear gas.
The mood is now frantic -- people destroying things or shouting everywhere --
ANN SWIFT No...
ANN SWIFT Hal -- yes -- INSIDE the building, IN --
Bob Anders SMASHES AMERICAN VISA PLATES.
The visa-applicant Iranians are now huddled in a group.
A couple of the women are wailing.
Improv resuming the debate over leaving.
Lijek on his walkie, but every channel is now speaking
MARK LIJEK Nobody is coming.
MARK LIJEK We need to go.
Mark gestures for the other six staffers -- and the twenty IRANIAN VISA SEEKERS in the office -- to head to the stairwell.
ARGO - Final 9.
BOB ANDERS Iranians first.
BOB ANDERS Go!
BOB ANDERS Now!
One STUDENT emerges with a large portrait of KHOMEINI that had been used for dart practice.
Who has made this!!!
Two EMBASSY EMPLOYEES look at the floor.
The twenty VISA-SEEKING IRANIANS pass our guys and run down the stairs out onto the street and disperse outside.
Behind them, the FIVE CONSULATE EMPLOYEES we saw head down the stairs.
So the group of SIX is: MARK AND CORA LIJEK, J AND KATHY STAFFORD, and BOB ANDERS.
They get to the bottom of the stairs.
The students, guns drawn, burst into the Chancery Office, shouting at Ann Swift and the others.
The mood among the staffers is now almost peaceful.
ANN SWIFT It's done.
ANN SWIFT They're in.
ANN SWIFT She puts down the phone.
The It's quiet -- the sound of the protest on the other side of the roof and the embassy campus is distant.
Just the empty street.
On the ground: discarded banners from the protest, fliers and newspapers.
We see something that looks like BLOOD on the street.
ARGO - Final 10.
They walk west.
They're hurrying but taking care not to run.
The five can hear the gunfire and shouting in Farsi.
They walk up the street, away from the sounds of the protest, instinctively grouping together.
Cora looks back.
BOB ANDERS Keep going.
Halfway around the world, hell has broken loose here, too.
BATES and MALICK, 30s, State Department mid-level aides.
A cascade of voices and energy -- a reverberation from the embassy siege -- the building exploding into a crisis center.
These fucks can hit us, we Mossadeq.
We did it to can't hit back?

BUTLER They're claiming the embassy was a ?den of -- ?
JORDAN We wish it was the fucking Den of Espionage.
JORDAN C.I.
JORDAN had three people there, didn't see a revolution coming?
JORDAN I'd call that something other than intelligence --
There are already maps of Iran on easels in here.
The big three plus foreign networks on silent televisions.
LANDON BUTLER, 30s, Jordan's Deputy Chief of Staff, is on the phone.
SECRETARY Hold for the Chief of Staff -- (holds out the phone
(to Secretary) They're sticking to it.

TITTERTON Fuck him.
JORDAN He's half dead and he's in chemo.
BUTLER We took him in.
BUTLER He's ours now.
TITTERTON So we'll take in any prick as long as he's got cancer?
ARGO - Final 13.
JORDAN No.
JORDAN Just the pricks on our side.
JORDAN So all our other pricks on their prick thrones know, when they get run out on a rail, they won't be getting their spleens out by a camel vet in the Sinai.
TITTERTON The six with the Canadians.
TITTERTON Now Jordan is looking at a monitor showing footage of a BLINDFOLDED HOSTAGE in front of the Embassy.
TITTERTON AL GOLACINSKI being prodded and led down the front stairs of the embassy.
JORDAN We've got 60 in the embassy with guns to their heads right now --
TITTERTON The eyes of the world are on the embassy.
TITTERTON That makes them safer than the six on the street.
Bani-Sadr's saying it'll be over in 24 hours.
JORDAN Leave the six where they are.
JORDAN I'll go brief the president.
A LONE ribbon sags in the f.g.
-- the CAPITOL BUILDING behind.
Yellow ribbons tied to lampposts.
A Catholic church with a sign on the lawn that says PRAY FOR OUR HOSTAGES.
A dry cleaner with a large American flag in the window and yellow ribbons drawn by kids around it.
The exterior of a neighborhood bar, O'Tooles.
More ribbons.
SUPERIMPOSE: McLEAN, VIRGINIA - 69 DAYS LATER
ARGO - Final 14.
A television connected to a faraway wall with an extension cord sits on a coffee table.
The t.v.
shows color test patterns.
We move over the coffee table, a mess of Chinese food containers and beer bottles, to find TONY MENDEZ, 40, asleep in his clothes from the day before.
The phone rings.
He answers it, half awake.
MENDEZ Yeah.
MENDEZ He listens for a moment, then sits up, suddenly wide- awake.
Mendez's car speeds by yellow ribbons along trees on Canal Road.
Mendez gets out of his car and hurries toward a white building that looks like a college campus.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) Prime Minister Bani-Sadr today re- stated demands for the hostages' release...
As we watch him hurry out of his car and into the CIA, we start to pick up TVs as we go by them -- all tuned to some version of the same story.
He enters the front doors and crosses the famous EMBLEM on the ground.
He moves past the STARS ON THE WALL, signifying fallen CIA officers (and there were fewer stars then than now).
He passes the SECURITY GUARD at the desk, holds up his badge.
The guard nods.
ARGO - Final 15.
A young Tom Brokaw in a yellow, sleeveless sweater and teal tie plays on the television, intoning on the Today Show.? ANGELA BELK, young wife of hostage WILLIAM BELK, has a soft Southern voice and fights back tears.

A glimmer of hope won't get out from over after the release of some there, because everything -- women and Afro-Americans it seems like everything but little activity in the they're trying to do is weeks since, and the images just backfiring, it's not of bound Americans under working -- armed guard have many losing hope -- Under these images we hear an undulating drone -- the constant accompaniment of life then -- coverage of the hostage crisis.
The United States shall not purchase oil from Iran.
Iranian assets shall be frozen and the U.S.
shall engage in a forceful campaign of international diplomacy against the Iranians...
MENDEZ (V.O.) Ten weeks State's sitting on this?

O'DONNELL Traffic calls them The Houseguests.
O'DONNELL Haven't left the Canadian ambassador's house since it happened.
MENDEZ Compromised?
O'DONNELL Just a matter of time.
O'DONNELL We've got Revolutionary Guards going door-to- door like Jehovah's Witnesses, looking for escapees.
O'DONNELL They're out for blood, Tony.
O'DONNELL Half of them think Khomeini's been too lenient with the ones in the embassy.
O'DONNELL Walking out of his office, Mendez following.
MENDEZ White House?
They walk through an open floor of cubicles lined with offices, we get a look at the 1979 CIA headquarters: nothing sleek or sexy about the interior.
An open area of desks where Woodward and Bernstein might be spilling coffee on their thick ?70s ties.
Papers and files everywhere.
Trash emptying happens only once a week.
Cigarette and cigar butts in ashtrays.
Everything is perpetually a mess.
And typewriters.
The constant percussive sound of telexes and typing is the metronome that beats out the day here.
O'DONNELL Carter's shitting enough bricks to build the pyramids.
O'DONNELL He wants the six of them out.
MENDEZ Who else knows?
O'DONNELL Just the families.
O'DONNELL Meanwhile, some genius in the embassy was keeping a mug book of everybody who worked there.
MENDEZ Jesus Christ.
ARGO - Final 17.

O'DONNELL Standing- room-only for beheadings in the square.
MENDEZ Who's handling?
MENDEZ They walk through a door and out of the Pit.
-- into a HALLWAY WITH POP ART on the walls.
People with laminated badges and folders with red stripes walk with purpose.
O'DONNELL State's coordinating in-house.
MENDEZ They don't do exfils.
O'DONNELL They do now.
O'DONNELL They want to run it by us, strictly as consultants.
O'DONNELL Off his look.
O'DONNELL Engell's saying it's lose-lose.
O'DONNELL These people die, they die badly.
O'DONNELL Publicly.
O'DONNELL ?State wants the blame, he'll give it to them.
MENDEZ Then why's he want me?
O'DONNELL So he can tell State he ran it by his best exfil guy.
O'DONNELL They stop in front of a conference room.
O'DONNELL Jack looks at him.
O'DONNELL Tony.
O'DONNELL This isn't the kind of meeting where you talk.
They enter to find: ADAM ENGELL, 40s or 50s, Deputy Chief of Operations, hosting visitors from the State Department: PENDER and BATES from State.
The State guys are both dressed better than the CIA guys, except for Engell.
Other CIA Operations OFFICERS and ANALYSTS sit in audience.
ENGELL Okay.
ENGELL This is Bob Pender from State O.S. He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

ARGO - Final 19.
What we like for this are bicycles.
We've identified backroads from the Shemiran district -- a couple of rat lines through the mountains to the crossing at Tabriz.
Cars are off the table because of the roadblocks.
Pender nods to Bates, who gs to a map, indicating the north of Iran.
BATES We wait till the weather clears up then we deliver six bikes and provide maps to the Turkish border.
PENDER We have intelligence they can ride bicycles.
PENDER Or we're prepared to send in somebody to teach them.

MENDEZ You don't wanna need one, but when you do, you don't do it yourself.
MENDEZ The meeting is breaking up.
MENDEZ Pender, followed by Bates, leaves the room.
MENDEZ Engell, who has just been made to look bad and inherited a problem, stops by Tony.

I'll defend myself.
Okay?
Watching every move -- A sound at the door, and they go silent.

LEE SCHATZ Ken carrying his briefcase, cheerfully oblivious to what he's walked into.
TAYLOR You're getting a visitor.
An NSC LIAISON, holding a file with a red stripe, walks to Jordan's office.
ARGO - Final 60.
He finds Jordan sitting on a long table, looking exhausted, silently watching one of the monitors: The Today Show? on NBC.

MENDEZ Business.
MENDEZ Film production.
MENDEZ The Consul Official looks at his Canadian passport.
CONSUL OFFICIAL Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?
MENDEZ My boss waited until I was here to send the telex.
If he had a thought in his head, it would die of loneliness.
Pointed look from Mendez.
The universal condition of boss hatred almost always works for him, and it ds now.
Consul nods.
Stamps the passport.
KINGDOM OF IRAN -- He crosses out KINGDOM and writes by hand: ISLAMIC REPUBLIC
Tony walks through the doorway revealing the historic mosque, we hear the call to prayer echo through the courtyard.

PETER NICHOLLS, an Oxbridge type and a very good spy.
ARGO - Final 62.
MENDEZ Can't be right all the time.
NICHOLLS Mr. Harkins.
MENDEZ When'd you get back?
FIND Mendez and Nicholls.
MENDEZ Were you metal detecting?

MENDEZ So if they look, they'll know six people didn't come in with me.
NICHOLLS If they look.
NICHOLLS Nicholls and Tony turn away from the mosaic, surreptitious work now done, and meander toward the middle of the great room.
Nicholls and Tony walk towards the inner courtyard.
NICHOLLS When you land, you should go straight to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to kiss the ring.
NICHOLLS Get on record as having applied for a film permit.
NICHOLLS If they catch you later, at least they'll be confused while they're torturing you...
NICHOLLS Your biggest problem may be convincing the six of them to go with you.
NICHOLLS They're foreign service.
NICHOLLS They're willful.
NICHOLLS Nicholls takes a picture.

NICHOLLS You and Christine?
MENDEZ Good.
MENDEZ Yeah.

KATHY STAFFORD ANGLES ON the Houseguests.
ARGO - Final 73.
MENDEZ Your cover identities were created specifically for each one of you.
MENDEZ Mendez, now dressed to leave, is handing each Houseguest an envelope.
MENDEZ What I need you to do is memorize everything inside.
MENDEZ Who you are, what you are, where you've been.
MENDEZ Cora Lijek looks at a document from inside her envelope.
MENDEZ A union card for the Canadian Writers Guild with her picture on it.
MENDEZ When we're done, you'll know these so well that you'll dream as these people.
MENDEZ Mendez nods at them, and gs.
MENDEZ The Houseguests look at what's inside their envelopes -- all except J Stafford, whose envelope remains sealed.
A TELEFAX MACHINE spells out a message, letter by letter:
Tony is PREPPING the CANADIAN PASSPORTS -- expertly copying Farsi stamps with a small sharpened stick.
A KNOCK on the door.
Tony hides the passports.
Answers the door.
Sir, a telex arrived for you.
The BELLHOP hands Tony a piece of paper.
He reads it.
ARGO - Final 74.
Mendez takes a small 1978 model radio out of his suitcase.
He unscrews the casing and from inside takes out what looks like a 6-inch transistor board for the radio.
On either side of the board: telephone jacks.
He detaches the cords from the hotel phone and plugs them into the jacks on the transistor board.
It's a phone scrambler.
MENDEZ (V.O.) ?The Minister of Culture and Guidance has approved your location scout.'
Mendez, on the phone --
MENDEZ ?He will send a representative to meet you and your crew at the Khayyam entrance to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 PM.'
O'Donnell on the phone.
O'DONNELL They called your bluff.
MENDEZ Or maybe they're cooperating.

O'DONNELL Are they even ready?
ARGO - Final 75.
MENDEZ They're getting there.
O'DONNELL Terrific.
O'DONNELL There's no prize for ?Most Improved.'
I don't have a choice.
We say no, they come to the residence and pull everyone out at gunpoint.
How do you think the covers hold up with their fingernails pulled out?
Mark Lijek is studying pages from the envelope Tony gave him.
J Stafford is sitting near him, having a drink, watching Iranian State Television footage of the Ayatollah.
J Stafford translates out loud.
J STAFFORD ?We are a nation of 35 million and...
J STAFFORD many of these people are looking forward to martyrdom.? Kathy Stafford looks into the room.

J STAFFORD Stay.
J STAFFORD Show Newsom you've got the balls.

Now on the level WITH CAMERA, we carry him INTO the office as he hands off the ARGO script and STUDIO SIX BUSINESS CARD.
Khalkali has some words in Farsi for the young man.
Tony looks at one of the Argo storyboards -- one depicting an EXOTIC SPICE MARKET, a BAZAAR -- in the light.
This isn't what we agreed to.
MORNING The Houseguests are gathered in the office.
MORNING Cora hands the telefax to Bob Anders.
MORNING J Stafford, looking on.
CORA LIJEK You said ?a day to learn your covers then straight to the airport.' You said that.
BOB ANDERS They suspect something?
ARGO - Final 77.
MENDEZ What I know is we need to act like a movie crew.
MENDEZ We go to the bazaar today, we fly out tomorrow.
MENDEZ Silent assent among the group.
MENDEZ Then J Stafford, sitting with his wife, speaks up --
J STAFFORD We won't do it.
MARK LIJEK He told them there were six of us.
MARK LIJEK They're expecting six.
You are about to show the only card we're holding.
Which is that they don't know we're here.
MENDEZ I'm asking you to trust me.
J STAFFORD I don't trust you.
BOB ANDERS What's the alternative?
BOB ANDERS This is the ball game, J. What world are you living in?
J STAFFORD The one where they're hanging people from construction cranes, Bob.
J STAFFORD J takes Kathy's hand and gs, leaving Mendez with the others.
J STAFFORD After a moment --

PAT TAYLOR She gives Bob Anders a Canadian maple leaf lapel pin, which he affixes to his shirt.

BOB ANDERS Pat shakes her head.

Kathy takes his hand.
ARGO - Final 79.
Somebody knows.
Tony getting dressed.
Thinking.
He gets up and leaves, and we start to hear the sound of a man talking fast in Farsi.
It's a CAR RENTAL MAN, 60s, speaking.
Tony is looking at a MINIVAN on a lot of beaten-up rental cars.
MENDEZ This one, how much?
MENDEZ One day, how much?
Four of the Houseguests are waiting on the couch, dressed in their best approximation of the clothes of a movie scout crew.
Cora has the maple leaf flag pin on her shirt.
They turn when they see Tony come in the door.
Tony as he steps down into the living room, down the hall
...
to find J Stafford sitting at the table.
They are badly shaken.
MENDEZ I promise you that if you will play along today, I will get you out tomorrow.
J STAFFORD I wish I could believe you, Mr.
J STAFFORD Harkins.
MENDEZ My name is Tony Mendez.
MENDEZ Mendez gs back out to the minivan.
MENDEZ STAY WITH J and Kathy.
Mendez, in the driver's seat, looks at the house, then at his watch.
He starts up the van, filled with four of the Houseguests.
Then he looks in the rearview and sees one of the back doors open.
J and Kathy Stafford board.
Tony drives the minivan through streets of Tehran.
The Houseguests sit in silence, looking out the windows.
There is a vehement DEMONSTRATION going on -- stars-and- stripes burning in Molavi Square -- and it's taking place right in their way.
They stop at the demonstration, then realize people aren't passing by as much as celebrating in the street.
Tony is forced to nose his way through the crowd -- chanting and yelling -- some SLAPPING THE WINDOWS.
They finally get through and pull away.
With the demonstration receding behind them, Tony tries to regain their focus.
MENDEZ Tell me who you are.
MENDEZ This recalls attention from the windows.

A YOUNG MAN IN SUIT WITH NO TIE waits.
This is REZA, mid- 20s, a low-level administrator in the Ministry of Guidance.
Mendez gets out and they speak and shake hands.
The image FREEZES.
In a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.
They exchange pleasantries and Reza leads them down a narrow street toward the bazaar.
Reza is leading Mendez and the group of Houseguests through the Tehran Bazaar.
A word about the place: the world's largest bazaar.
10 kilometers of narrow alleys.
Chinese-made Swiss watches, banks, mosques, butchers, fabric stores, gold stands.
Boys with hand-trucks loaded down with piles of fabric cut through the crowd.
Older Islamic architecture elbows up against neon signs and rickety wooden stands with second-story balconies like Bourbon Street.
Bob Anders walks toward the front.
REZA You are the director?
BOB ANDERS Yes.
Is this film a foreign bride film?
BOB ANDERS I'm sorry?
REZA A film where a foreign bride is brought to Iran, but she dsn't understand the language and customs and there are misunderstandings and laughs.
BOB ANDERS No.
ARGO - Final 82.
REZA Mmmm.
REZA Mendez walking toward the back of the group.
REZA Lee, the cameraman, is looking through a viewfinder down the alley of the bazaar.

MENDEZ Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it again.
LEE SCHATZ Yep.

She gs to greet them at the gate.
SAHAR (Farsi, from behind
Yes?
ARGO - Final 83.
Reza leads Mendez and the Houseguests deeper into this city within a city; fundamentalist ground zero.
BAZAARIS stand at their shop doors; puzzled; unfriendly; watching the visitors.
Kathy Stafford, the production designer on the scout, takes a Polaroid of a window adorned in gold.
The SHOPKEEPER, a 70-ish bazaari, sees her do so.
He hurries out of his store, speaking in rapid-fire Farsi at her.
The Houseguests stop.
Reza speaks to the Shopkeeper.
He wants the photograph you took.
MENDEZ She's the production designer.
MENDEZ Her job is to take photographs.
MENDEZ SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi.
REZA He says he did not give you permission to take a photograph of his store.
REZA Other BAZAARIS and SHOPPERS are starting to gather.
REZA Kathy holds out the Polaroid toward the Shopkeeper.
KATHY STAFFORD He can have the photograph.
KATHY STAFFORD Tell
HIM -- The Shopkeeper knocks the Polaroid out of her hand.
When did they arrive?
I'm sorry?
ARGO - Final 84.
The guests of the ambassador.
How long have they been in this house?
People are now starting to surround Mendez and Reza and the Houseguests.
Bazaaris more and more heated.
Women in chadors are screaming and finger-pointing.
America NO!...

Then he speaks in Farsi and makes shooting gestures with his hand.
LEE SCHATZ He's saying the Shah killed his son with an American gun.
LEE SCHATZ Cauldron heating up and --

Two days.
They arrived two days ago.
Khalkali looks to the other Officials.
DAY A CROWD starts to gather around the group.
Her claustrophobia as the crowd closes in -- an ANGRY BAZAARI WOMAN sticks her finger in Kathy's face --
CORA LIJEK Canada...
CORA LIJEK Ca-na-da...
ARGO - Final 85.
She's showing a Canadian flag, Bob Anders' lapel button --
LEE SCHATZ He says we're the CIA taking photographs to plan the bombing of the city.
DAY Khalkali eyes Sahar, gauging her.
DAY She hides her fear well.
Sister, those who are with him, Rasool of Allah, we are tender among ourselves.
But stern against the kuffar.
SAHAR As god wills it.
But those who sit silently have sinned.
Ds he know?
Ds he not know?
Is he trying to trick her?
His opacity makes it impossible to know.
He holds his look to her -- and she holds hers.
Reza indicates an exit to the street.
DAY -- and Sahar, so dignified and stony she is almost shaming these men --
SAHAR Everyone in this house is a friend of Iran.
SAHAR Khalkali makes his decision.
SAHAR He wordlessly turns to go.
The CROWD heckles the Houseguests as they walk toward the exit.
Sahar calmly closes the door.
After she ds, she lets the facade go.
All of a sudden scared.
Maybe she tears up.
Either way, it's clear she knows the stakes of the game she is playing.
The aftermath.
The Houseguests, badly shaken, come inside.
Each dealing with shock and adrenaline.
Ken Taylor comes up next to Mendez and, for once, Taylor's ambassadorial calm is breaking.
TAYLOR They drew you out there to take your picture.
MENDEZ Nobody broke.
MENDEZ At the door to the residence, Tony can see Pat Taylor, holding Sahar's hand, both looking spooked as the Houseguests come inside.
And tomorrow?
A beat on Mendez, who stamps out his cigarette and follows.
MENDEZ Tomorrow they'll be ready.
MENDEZ We start to hear the sound of the evening's call to prayer, amplified over a megaphone, in the distance.
ARGO - Final 87.
The call to prayer echoing as night falls in Tehran.
In an alley where cloaked women hurry past posters of Khomeini.
On a street where a five-year-old boy, in the care of his eight-year-old brother, watches a pickup truck of armed komiteh speed past.
Mendez holds a passport and some papers in front of Bob Anders' face.
It feels late.
The Houseguests are tired, sweating, sitting around a dining room.

MENDEZ Bob Anders dsn't know.
MENDEZ ANGLES ON the Houseguests.

MENDEZ He looks down to consult the paper in front of him, but before he can, Mendez pulls the paper.
MENDEZ He's an American spy.
MENDEZ Shoot him.
MENDEZ A beat on Stafford, frustrated --
MENDEZ They'll try to break you by getting you agitated.
MENDEZ You need to know your rA(C)sumA(C) so well that you don't flinch.
J STAFFORD (nearly defeated,
You think your little story will matter when there's guns to our heads?
MENDEZ My story's the only thing between you and the gun to your head.
MENDEZ A beat.
MENDEZ Mendez puts the rA(C)sumA(C) back in front of Stafford.
MENDEZ Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't good at this.
ARGO - Final 89.
MENDEZ Let's go again.
O'Donnell, walking toward his office.
It's the first time today Malinov has seen him.
They made it through the location scout.
O'Donnell ignores him.
He gs straight to his office.
Looking like he's seen a ghost.
Mendez, finishing a cigarette outside.
We might hear the distant sound of a phone ringing.
Ken Taylor emerges.
Waits a beat.
TAYLOR Kevin.
Mendez picks up the complicated-looking satellite phone in Ken Taylor's home office.
As soon as he ds --
O'DONNELL Go to black on green.
O'DONNELL Jack's calling him here, so he knows something's wrong.
MENDEZ What is it?
O'DONNELL Go to black on green.
O'DONNELL Mendez turns knobs on the satellite phone.
We see Jack is on a GREEN PHONE.
ARGO - Final 90.
O'DONNELL It all just changed.
O'DONNELL They called the game.
O'DONNELL You've got to come back.
O'DONNELL ON Mendez, not believing what he's hearing.
O'DONNELL Joint Chiefs are planning a military rescue of the hostages in a month.
O'DONNELL Delta Force started training to storm the grounds.
O'DONNELL So if the six of them get brought down there, they won't be held for long.
MENDEZ I never would have exposed them if I wasn't authorized to take them out.
O'DONNELL It's over, Tony.
MENDEZ They will be taken.
MENDEZ Probably not
O'DONNELL LISTEN TO ME.
O'DONNELL The thinking's changed.
O'DONNELL Six Americans get pulled out of a Canadian diplomat's house and executed, it's another world outrage.
O'DONNELL Six Americans get caught playing movie make-believe with the CIA at the airport and executed, it's a national embarrassment.
O'DONNELL They're calling the operation.
MENDEZ We're responsible for those people.
What we are is required to follow orders.
I'm sorry.
Mendez hangs up.
O'Donnell sits listening to the dial tone for a moment, then puts the phone on the receiver.
ARGO - Final 91.
Then, very suddenly, he looks at an old coffee cup near him and backhands it off his desk.
Maybe only a minute, maybe ten or more have passed.
Mendez sits at Taylor's desk, numb.
Cora Lijek knocks but dsn't get a response.
She tentatively opens the door and sticks her head inside.
CORA LIJEK We're ready to try again.
MENDEZ I think the most important thing you can do to be ready for tomorrow is rest.
NIGHT Now the mood among the Houseguests is lighter.
NIGHT Bob Anders, a handful of liquor bottles in his arms, puts them down on a table.
NIGHT Music plays on a record player.
BOB ANDERS Scorched earth policy tonight.
BOB ANDERS Nothing gets left.
BOB ANDERS Taylor comes in, drink in hand, thoughts heavy, looks at Tony.
MENDEZ So you know.
ExtAff wants you to burn the passports before you leave.
Mendez looks at the Houseguests, setting the table.
TAYLOR If we tell them, they'll panic.
TAYLOR It's better if you just don't show.
ARGO - Final 92.
It was always a fucked mission.
You came closer than anybody else.
Kathy and Cora are cracking each other up.
No one sees Mendez take a bottle of Macallan from the table and put it in his bag.
Mendez drives through nighttime Tehran, back to the hotel.
There is a dangling TOTEM from the rearview mirror.
It reflects light.
He passes a VAN ON FIRE.
Mendez takes the bottle of Macallan from his bag.
He takes a drink, then drinks more.
Chambers, listening on a phone, shakes his head at Siegel.
He hangs up.
CHAMBERS It's off.
CHAMBERS They want us to pack up the office.
CHAMBERS A beat on Lester.
CHAMBERS He's devastated but he's not showing it.
SIEGEL They can wait.
SIEGEL Let's go get a drink.
The city waking up.
ARGO - Final 93.
The Houseguests, getting dressed.
Suiting up for the airport.
Ken Taylor watches in the hall.
Mendez -- who looks like he hasn't slept -- sits at a table, looking out the window.
Lee Schatz puts his Infant of Prague holy card into an Argo script.
Packs the script.
Cora Lijek is sitting next to her husband.
Kathy Stafford looks at the clock.
KATHY STAFFORD He's late.
Tony comes out to the balcony with a hotel ice bucket in one hand and the Canadian passports in the other.
He puts the passports in the bucket, LIGHTS A MATCH.
He looks down at the match, at the passports.
The first stirring of the morning calls-to-prayer echo in the distance.
HOLD for a long beat ON Tony.
Thinking.
Then, HE BLOWS OUT THE MATCH.
O'Donnell is packing up for the night.
Paper towels sit on top of the coffee spill on his rug.
His phone rings.
He picks up.
O'DONNELL Yeah.
MENDEZ Somebody is responsible for things when things happen, Jack.
MENDEZ I am responsible.
I'm taking them through.
And before Jack can answer, Tony hangs up.
Stands.
A duffel bag over his shoulder, Tony turns out the light in the hotel room.
Gs.
O'Donnell, thinking.
Looking at the phone.
Then, with a sudden decision, he gets up.
Rushing out of his office, into --
-- where he catches ALAN SOSA, 50s, head of the Directorate of Support -- the CIA's chief financial officer -- leaving for the night.
O'DONNELL We need to confirm those seven tickets out of Tehran on
SOSA N.E.
SOSA shut that down.
O'DONNELL I'm saying it's back on!
SOSA I can't do it.
SOSA It's backstopped pending Executive Branch GO.
O'DONNELL What the fuck ds that mean?
SOSA Carter's got to say yes for us to get the tickets.
Pat Taylor comes to answer an insistent knocking on her front door.
She opens it.
ARGO - Final 95.
She's shocked to see him.
Ken Taylor now appears behind Pat.
In the hall behind him: The Houseguests are assembled, waiting to go.
They look their parts -- or, much more so than they did on the scout.
Cora Lijek has darker hair.
The Staffords look on, fully dressed.
O'DONNELL Where's Engell?
SECRETARY He's in a meeting.
O'DONNELL Pull him out.
Pat Taylor is embracing the Houseguests, saying goodbye.
PAT TAYLOR Sahar's on a bus.
MENDEZ Good.
MENDEZ And you two leave right now.
MENDEZ Ken Taylor nods.
MENDEZ Mendez shakes his hand.
Mendez gets into the driver's seat.

Engell just stares O'Donnell down.
The van speeds down the hills of the Shemiran district.
MENDEZ (V.O.) The first checkpoint is just to look at your passport.
Mendez is sitting in the living room instructing the Houseguests.
ARGO - Final 97.
MENDEZ Your passports came straight from the Canadians, so you're gonna be fine.
O'Donnell, charging in --
O'DONNELL Where's the Director?

He gives out yellow immigration forms to the Houseguests.
ARGO - Final 98.
MENDEZ The second is immigration.
MENDEZ You'll hand them these.
MENDEZ They say you landed two days ago.
Cora Lijek fingers her yellow immigration form in one hand, holds Mark's hand with the other.
MENDEZ (V.O.) These guys are bureaucrats left over from the shah.
MENDEZ (V.O.) They can't be bothered to second-guess you.
Malinov slams a phone down.
MALINOV Pace Academy in Buckhead, Georgia!
MALINOV O'Donnell dials a number.
O'DONNELL Yes, it's Mr. Murphy calling from Pace Academy for Mr. Jordan...
O'DONNELL I'm afraid it IS an emergency...
Hold just a moment.
She plugs a wire into an old-fashioned Ma Bell switchboard.
MENDEZ (V.O.) Third checkpoint is the trap.
The van pulls up to the airport.
We see THRONGS of people trying to get in -- so they can get out.
Tony pulls the car to a semi-open place and tries not to run anyone over.
ARGO - Final 99.
MENDEZ It's manned by Revolutionaries.
MENDEZ Most of them were educated in the U.S.
MENDEZ or Europe.
BOB ANDERS Or Canada?
MENDEZ They know how many ?T's are in Toronto.
Jordan is in a meeting with two staffers, his feet up on the desk.
His secretary opens the door without knocking, hurries to Jordan, whispers something in his ear.
He immediately grabs the phone.

ARGO - Final 100.
KHALKALI, the fiery guy who came to the residence, along with two YOUNG KOMITEH compare (one who delivered the pictures): on one side, copies of re-assembled diplomatic photographs of Americans from the embassy -- like the ones of the Houseguests we saw early in the film -- and, on the other side, the candid photographs from the bazaar.

MALINOV Swissair says they've picked up the tickets.
O'DONNELL Get the L.A. office -- tell them to be ready in case they call.
ARGO - Final 101.
MALINOV We told them to shut that down!
MALINOV He RUNS toward a phone --
The PASSPORT OFFICIAL is looking at the Canadian passports of the six and waving them through.
Mendez has already passed.
Everyone except Kathy Stafford.
The Passport Official looks at Kathy, who is doing her best to look friendly and casual.
Then he looks at Kathy's passport, in which she looks stern and angry.
Kathy Stafford smoothes down her hair, frowns like she ds in the passport photo.
The Passport Official half smiles and waves her through.
They've all cleared the first checkpoint.
Khalkali comes upon a diplomatic photograph of a man with glasses.
He starts to leaf through the photographs from the bazaar.
Mark Lijek being photographed at the bazaar the previous day.

MATCH.
Khalkali stands up.
SHOUTS in Farsi to another Komiteh --
ARGO - Final 102.
Bob Anders stands in front of a rough-voiced IMMIGRATION OFFICER.
He's holding Bob Anders' YELLOW IMMIGRATION FORM and leafing through a file of hundreds of WHITE IMMIGRATION FORMS, the duplicates.
Without success.

Nothing.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER When did you say you arrived in Iran?

BOB ANDERS I'm the director.
BOB ANDERS Immigration Officer pauses and looks up.
BOB ANDERS Looks at the six other faces.
BOB ANDERS He looks every bit as confrontational as Tony acted in rehearsal.
We have a letter from the Minister of Culture ...
The Immigration Officer gestures for the letter.
Bob takes the letter inviting them on their location scout out of a folder.
Tony, barely perceptibly, nods.
Khalkali is now speaking with MORADI, an older Komiteh official.
They speak Farsi and it's untranslated, but we get it.
He is showing the photograph of Mark Lijek from the bazaar and comparing it to the U.S. diplomatic photograph.
Moradi picks up the phone as Khalkali heads out.
ARGO - Final 103.
Immigration Officer is conferring with Immigration Officer #2 as they look at the letter from the Minister of Culture.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER Second checkpoint done.
Malinov, a phone to his ear.
Ringing.
MALINOV C'mon c'mon c'mon --
The phone in the office rings.
No one is there.
Siegel and Chambers are walking back to the Argo office.
They are within sight of the Argo bungalow, but a P.A.
steps in front of them.
P.A. I'm sorry, we're shooting.
P.A. He motions for them to wait.
P.A. A movie -- it looks like a police procedural -- is shooting on the lot between them and the office.
ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.) Swissair announces general boarding for Flight 363 to Zurich.

Mendez checks in with the Houseguests with his eyes.
They are now in sight of the airport gates.
And here are six Komiteh.
Young men -- none more than 33 or so -- holding automatic weapons.
They have created their own checkpoint.
It looks recent,
KOMITEH #1 Passports.
KOMITEH #1 He looks at the Canadian passports and then almost immediately speaks.
KOMITEH #1 You come.
KOMITEH #1 He directs Mendez and the Houseguests into the screened- off area.
KOMITEH #1 Speaks in Farsi to another Komiteh.
LAMONT Purser's telling Swissair they're not on the plane.
O'DONNELL They should have boarded already.

ARGO - Final 105.
AZIZI (harsh, icy; in
You.
You had no business in Iran.
He motions for J STAFFORD to step forward.
Mendez shifts.
A tense moment.
We did.
We were preparing to make a movie here, sir.
You don't have journalist visas.
Not a documentary.
A movie.
J Stafford reaches into his pocket and gives Azizi a copy of the Argo Variety ad.
You see?
Kevin, where's your briefcase?
A beat on Mendez.
Who then opens his accordion folder and takes from it the ARGO STORYBOARDS.
J Stafford spreads them out on the table.
Three other Komiteh in the room lean forward, their AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at their sides, and look at the STORYBOARD DRAWINGS.
The Persian Empire futurism of Jack Kirby's drawings.
These are the villains.
Y'see these guys here?
And these are the hers...
in the spice market...
J Stafford points at the various drawings.
He speaks with an ease and confidence that we didn't know he had.
They know our hero is the Chosen One, so they kidnap his son in the spice market ...
They have these chariots...

Azizi looks at the Studio Six business card and picks up the receiver.
SIEGEL I'm sorry, pally.
SIEGEL We're just gonna be in the movie.
SIEGEL Call my agent.

P.A. Siegel and Chambers walk through the shot toward the Argo office.
Azizi dials the long international number.
And it is a DIAL, so this takes a long time.
One of the young Komiteh is loudly debating with another Komiteh the air-worthiness of a futuristic desert glider in the storyboards.
He's miming the thing crashing.
J Stafford and the Houseguests are silent.
Mendez can see the line of passengers on their Swissair flight dwindling.
Azizi rings the phone three times -- four times -- he's going to hang up --

Then he leaves.
The three young Komiteh look at the drawings, then at J Stafford.
Silence for a moment.
Our gift to you.
From our film.
Komiteh #1, who speaks enough English to understand, translates to the others.
