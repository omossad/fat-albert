THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU
Written by
George Nolfi
Based on a short story by
Philip K Dick
BLACK SCREEN The sounds of a large crowd, but muffled, as if we're inside,
and hearing the crowd through a window or door.
FADE IN ON:
DAVID NORRIS, 33, is having a private moment, looking down, thinking.
He wears a suit and tie.
He seems relaxed and confident.
Content.
Completely in his element.
In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges.
We hear the muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside:
Thank you so much for coming today-- A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David.
Congressman Norris-?
Now REVEAL that we're A?fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building at St.
Johns University.
A thousand people crowd the quad out front.
"Norris for Senate" placards everywhere.
Fred O'Malley with the DNC.
I've never seen a crowd this big turn out so early in the cycle.
CHARLIE TRAYNOR, 36, arrives--.
CHARLIE Just wait 'till you see how they respond to him..
CHARLIE David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens his lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State.
DAVID Don't build me up like that, Charlie.
DAVID He'll be disappointed.
The crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of the Admin Building.
DAVID Hi there.
DAVID I'm David Norris.
DAVID And I'm running for the US Senate.
The crowd goes wild.
--David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation.
The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing ovation.
--David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison plant in Buffalo.
He's a natural at this.
Unlike most politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning.
--Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball with a group of Bronx teenagers.
Charlie is nearby.
--David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin redevelopment of an old military base upstate.
--He gives a speech at a Harlem church.
Audiences watch David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama today.
He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to follow him.
Especially young people.
--David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their camera-phones.
People crush around him.
He:doesn't seem to mind at all.
He welcomes it.
He feeds off it.
--He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice.
Charlie stands nearby watching him speak:.
David enters his hotel room.
The silence contrasts starkly with the noisy energy of the campaign trail.
He turns on the TV.
Scrolls through the channels.
After a moment shuts it off.
Total silence again.
It bothers him.
He opens up his briefcase.
Pulls out a thick file -- his itinerary for the next three days.
Dozens of speeches and meetings across the state.
He glances at the summary page on the top.
Glances down the page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open Space Initiative.
Karen Woods, founder.
Husband: Bob.
DAVID (CONT'D) Kids: Samantha, painting, and Ricky, Little League.
DAVID (CONT'D) John Pascal.
DAVID (CONT'D) Wife: Anna.
DAVID (CONT'D) St.
DAVID (CONT'D) John's grad.
DAVID (CONT'D) Two year old: Loyita...
DAVID (CONT'D) He stops.
DAVID (CONT'D) Knows this cold.
DAVID (CONT'D) His finger runs down to a Realtor's Association breakfast in Nassau County four days out.
Abagail "Abby" Best, Stuart Broxterman, Chapel Davis, Milan Sabovic, Jim Vargas...
His ability to retain this sort of information is stunning.
He doesn't need to review.
It's already all there.
He closes his itinerary file.
Goes to the window and looks out at the trees.
The silence back...it's deafening.
Charlie enters the lobby.
Stops suddenly: spots David, holding court at`the hotel bar.
Fifteen strangers around him as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's clearly losing his voice.
Charlie walks over, pulls him aside.
CHARLIE What the hell?
CHARLIE What happened to "I'm going to have softie tea, rest my voice, and go to bed early?" You have Diane Sawyer tomorrow and you have to be up at four AM for us to make it in time.
CHARLIE David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand.
CHARLIE With his free hand he picks up a cup and saucer.
DAVID I had some tea.
DAVID (sees Charlie's not in the
Come on, man.
We're eight points up in the polls.
I've gotta cut loose every once in a while and have a life.
This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie.
Fifteen strangers in a crappy upstate Sheraton doesn't seem like having a life to him...
CHARLIE Ten.
DAVID What?
CHARLIE Latest poll has you ten points up.
CHARLIE A slow smile spreads across David's face.
The sound of a busy room.
Then one voice, much louder:
County reporting: 8901 for Lynfield, 7233 for Norris.
Charlie Traynor walks over to the aide who just shouted that.
She's writing vote totals onto a map of New York by county.
Better than I thought, I thought we'd get killed in Seneca.
He turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen Norris supporters talking on phones and typing into laptops.
CHARLIE Eddie, call Boyd!
CHARLIE Where the hell are the.
CHARLIE Suffolk numbers?
CHARLIE We've got to get the Suffolk numbers!
A light snow falls.
Four MEN IN CONSERVATIVE SUITS, overcoats, and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty-story building.
Their clothing is more timeless than old- fashioned.
And somehow so is their demeanor.
The men get to the edge and look down over the city, almost- as if it's their domain.
David watches the election coverage on TV.
Pundits are discussing the New York Senate race, which CNN has already called for David's opponent.
Congressman Norris has a reputation for being very direct, even blunt, in his campaign speeches, which is great until you say too many things you wish you hadn't.
Then you start to look like an amateur.
That's bad for any candidate but it's fatal if you're running for Senate at the age of 33, your opponent keeps calling you an "impulsive kid," and you almost killed your entire political career five months ago with an act of immaturity that ended up on the front page of`.the New York Post.
David winces slightly.
This is excruciating.
Just then Charlie enters..
The nerve center.suite is visible through the open door behind him.
Why are you still watching CNN?
They called this way too early.
David doesn't share his friend's optimism.
A' campaign aide with a phone to her ear shouts to the room:
AIDE Suffolk County Numbers!
AIDE Charlie and David emerge from the private room to listen.
Lynfield: 415,120.
Norris:
Charlie's energy and optimism disappear instantly.
CHARLIE I really thought we'd win Suffolk.
A senior aide walks over.
SENIOR AIDE Kings County just came in too.
He shows a piece of paper to Charlie and David.
beat...
DAVID Well, it's over.
DAVID And it's going to be a blowout...
DAVID David puts on a brave face.
DAVID .but this is the first moment that he realizes not only is he going to lose, but he's going to lose big.
DAVID It's going to be a grand,.
DAVID public humiliation.
SENIOR AIDE NBC has us up next.
SENIOR AIDE Charlie takes a clicker and turns the closest TV to NBC.
Turning now to the New York Senate race, NBC is now calling the election for Roger'Lynfield.
After a shockingly poor showing in both Suffolk county and in his home county, Kings, it now appears that David Norris will lose this election badly, perhaps by as much as 10 points.
The four men in dark suits..
The boss's name is RICHARDSON, early 40s.
His top aide is.AHARRY, 50s.
RICHARDSON This is a.bignight, gentleman.
Is ever ything set?
Harry nods.
Richardson notices his eyes:
RICHARDSON You look tired.
RICHARDSON You should take a vacation when we finish with this.
RICHARDSON You'll have earned it.
HARRY I'm not sure the kind of tired I feel would be fixed by a vacation.
RICHARDSON Sure it would.
RICHARDSON Everybody needs a vacation.
RICHARDSON Even us.
The staff and supporters in here have become very quiet.
Their candidate is standing in the middle of the room, but no one can look at him.
And David can't look at them either...
I'm going to take a walk, figure out my speech.
INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT Four-hundred campaign workers follow election news on big screens in the Waldorf's Grand Ballroom.
INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT No one says a word.
INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT The mood has gone from.hopeful to funereal in sixty seconds.
David slips through the lobby with only a few looks from the staff.
But when he.gets to the door he sees that press vans line the front of the hotel.
There will be no peace for him if he steps out there.
He turns around.
ASSISTANT MANAGER Good evening, Congressman.
ASSISTANT MANAGER You're in the Grand Ballroom if that's what you're looking for.
DAVID Actually just looking for a place to be alone for a minute before I head in there.
ASSISTANT MANAGER None of the banquet rooms on the third floor are in use tonight.
DAVID Thank you.
David stands alone looking out at the empty room.
Trying to get used to it.
It's not easy.
David enters the huge, ornate, men's room and goes to the row of sinks.
He pulls two Ricola cherry lozenges from his pocket.
He twirls them in his hands for a moment.
Then tosses them into the trash can.
He looks at himself in the mirror, fighting to hold himself together.
A sound behind him.
David spins to see a WOMAN exiting one of the stalls.
She's in a stunning ball gown and carrying an expensive bottle of champagne.
WOMAN Hi.
WOMAN I hope I didn't startle you.
DAVID What are you doing in here?
WOMAN Hiding from security.
DAVID Oh...
DAVID What did you do?
WOMAN Crashed a wedding.
WOMAN One floor up.
DAVID It's almost midnight.
DAVID They'just caught on now?
WOMAN Ivana Trump finally realized I wasn't her niece.
WOMAN I think after the fifth; glass of champagne my Czech accent started slipping.
WOMAN spite of David's state that gets a grin.
DAVID Are you for real?
WOMAN Life is short.
DAVID Hard to argue with that.
WOMAN You're that guy running for Senate aren't you?
DAVID I'm "that guy."
WOMAN You winning?
DAVID No.
WOMAN Too bad.
WOMAN The other guy's a tool.
Maybe I should have made that clearer in my ads.
WOMAN Personally, I think mooning your friends at a college reunion is no big deal.
And I don't think the Post should have printed the photo.
David just shakes his head.
He will never, ever live that down and he knows it.
WOMAN At least not full page.
WOMAN He can't help but crack up.
WOMAN Listen, I've done it.
DAVID You weren't running, for Senate at the time.
WOMAN Do you still have a chance or is it over?
DAVID He crushed me.
DAVID She has beautiful eyes.
DAVID And an exceptional gift for conveying empathy...
WOMAN You must ...I don't know what you must be feeling...
DAVID Winning would feel better.
DAVID But losing has its advantages.
WOMAN Like what?
DAVID The only time a politician is alone is when he's asleep..
DAVID .or in the bathroom.
DAVID After eight years in politics that gets kind of hard to take.
DAVID She tilts her head a little, gives him a curious look.
WOMAN Watching you, you'd never know it.
WOMAN The way she looks at him, the way she says it, David knows she sees what others miss in him -- even if he isn't even quite sure what it is.
WOMAN Not yet.
DAVID Thank you...
WOMAN Well, everything happens for a reason, right?
WOMAN Even losing.
WOMAN God, I'm really rollrng out the platitudes tonight, aren't I?
DAVID It's the champagne.
DAVID Brines out the Hallmark in people.
WOMAN After it kills their Czech accents.
WOMAN She offers:him the bottle.
WOMAN He hesitates, then takes it.
DAVID Why not?
DAVID I have to think up some good platitudes for my speech.
DAVID He takes a gulp of champagne.
WOMAN Why the hell would you do that?
DAVID Apparently, even if I hadn't been caught dropping my drawers in the middle of a senate campaign I would have lost the election anyway because I'm too blunt.
WOMAN Says who?
DAVID The TV pundits.
WOMAN Fuck 'em.
WOMAN They just wish they had the balls to be candidates themselves.
WOMAN She hands him the champagne bottle again.
WOMAN And they work for the Man anyway.
You going to run again?
Tonight's probably not the night to ask.
No, it is.
Look at me.
You have to run again.
Do-yo hear me?
She's serious about this.
Intense.
WOMAN Otherwise the-country will be run by tools.
WOMAN like Lynwood.
DAVID "Field."
DAVID "Lynfield."
DAVID A beat.
DAVID She shrugs.
DAVID Then they lean toward each other...
DAVID and kiss.
DAVID It turns more
and more passionate.
When they finally pull apart:
DAVID Holy shit.
DAVID She seems just as surprised.
DAVID They look at each other and laugh.
DAVID Just then the bathroom door opens.
DAVID It's Charlie.
DAVID He sees David and the woman.
CHARLIE David?
I better go.
She exits.
The woman comes out of the bathroom.
David is right behind her.
Then Charlie.
DAVID Wait.
DAVID The woman turns to face David.
DAVID Suddenly two hotel guards turn the corner and spot the woman.
There!
They rush toward her.
WOMAN Gotta go.
WOMAN Don't let the bastards grind you down.
WOMAN She spins and sprints away.
WOMAN The hotel guards chase her.
CHARLIE What the hell was that?
DAVID I'm really not sure.
DAVID David has a huge grin on his face.
DAVID But I think I'm ready to give my speech.
INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT David as he walks out from behind a curtain onto the dais.
INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT His supporters start clapping...
INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT but clearly they're heartbroken.
INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT David looks completely peaceful.
DAVID I grew up in Red Hook and I don't want to shock anybody but I got in a few fist fights along the way.
DAVID Laughter ripples through the crowd.
DAVID We don't know enough yet to get the joke.
DAVID And we used to have a saying when you got in a fight: "it's not whether or not you get knocked down -- because eventually everyone does -- it's what you do when you get back up."
Don't worry, I'm not going to moon you.
The audience explodes with laughter this time.
DAVID But I am...
DAVID But I am going to get backup.
DAVID I wanted to come out here tonight and give you a victory speech, a speech I've dreamed of giving foremost of my life.
DAVID But life doesn't always deal you the cards you want.
DAVID The audience sobered now.
DAVID Reflective.
DAVID My life changed when I was ten years old.
DAVID My entire world turned upside-down.' His audience,.
DAVID knows exactly what he's talking about.
DAVID And as I looked for something to -hang ;on to, something; to help me cope' with what had.
DAVID happened the only thing that made sense to me was service.
DAVID Finding a way to do something with my life that left this world a little better than I found it.
DAVID The audience is moved.
DAVID Tears begin to well up.
DAVID People dab at their eyes.
The sky is just beginning to turn from black to deep blue.
The park is still and silent.
A black Mercedes pulls up on Madison Ave.
Mr. Richardson, again in a dark suit, gets out and enters the park.
Harry sits on one of the benches -- a fedora in his lap to complement a gray flannel suit.
Richardson arrives.
RICHARDSON He spills his coffee when he steps out of Starbucks.
RICHARDSON The moment he comes through the door.
HARRY Got it.
RICHARDSON Our models indicate between 7:00 and 7:05 am.
RICHARDSON Harry nods but he seems distant Richardson sees this.
You planned that vacation, right?
HARRY Two weeks.
HARRY Richardson claps him din-the shoulder and leaves.
HARRY Harry watches him go.

INT. BUS -- MORNING Instead it spills: on the floor.
HARRY Dammit!

HARRY Harry turns just in time to see a.taxi skid into him.
HARRY TRUNK!
HARRY He rolls up onto the hood--
A big corner office.
The phone rings.
Charlie picks up.
Guess who I just sat down next to on the bus?
CHARLIE Who?
DAVID The woman from election night.
EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING A dazed Harry lies in the road...
EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING The taxi driver who hit him jumps out of his car to see if Harry is okay...

DAVID She kissed me.
DAVID I just didn't fight it.
EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING Harry sits up...
EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING He's bruised but okay.
EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING He looks around for something.
EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING Spots his crushed hat under the taxi's front tire.
CHARLIE You're shitting me.
CHARLIE Just randomly you sit down next to-- He's cut off mid-word.
DAVID Charlie?
DAVID David looks at his phone.
DAVID "Call Lost" on the screen.
DAVID David hits redial.
DAVID Gets a fast busy.
DAVID ' (to himself).
DAVID This is ridiculous.
DAVID He pockets his phone.
The taxi driver is with Harry now.
Are you okay?
Harry is sitting now, wincing, but still searching intently for something.
HARRY I'm fine-- Will you hand me that?
HARRY Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few feet away.
HARRY We'll come to know it as a "PLANBOOK."
Are you sure you're okay?
The driver hands it to him.
Harry flips to a bookmarked page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram: Thousands of interconnected lines.
Dozens of geometric symbols at intersection points.
And written notations in a language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese.
And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.
HARRY Oh...shit...
David's still grinning as he reaches his downtown office tower.
He enters through the revolving door--
Empty, except for a bored-looking security guard at the other end of the lobby.
David gets into an empty elevator.
David walks past the receptionist She's on the phone.
He waves as-he:passes by.
No wade back.
She must not see him.
DAVID Okay...
DAVID Daviddecides he doesn't need to announce himself.
David enters to find the office suite quiet...
Not a soul in sight.
Not a single secretary is here.
DAVID Doesn't anybody bother getting in before eight at this place?
DAVID David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office marked "Charles Traynor, Chairman."
DAVID She's smiling.
Susan!
How are you today?
Susan?
David looks closer across her desk.
Her face is frozen.
DAVID (CONT'D) Susan?
DAVID (CONT'D) He leans across her desk, touches her arm.
DAVID (CONT'D) She stays dead
still.
David rushes through Charlie's door:
DAVID Call 911!
DAVID Something's wrong with Susan!
--and rushes in to find that Charlie is frozen too -- with the phone up to his ear.
Like he's in a wax museum.
He is surrounded by four men in bulky, metallic silver protective suits .(think airport firefighter gear).
One of the men adjusts three metal.
probes which are attached to the left side.of Charlie's skull.
DAVID Jesus!
DAVID Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see David.
DAVID it's Mr. Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the "security guards" who chased Elise away on election night.
What the hell are you doing?!
Richardson blinks Clearly surprised.
Then:
RICHARDSON Grab him!
RICHARDSON David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him--
David sprints toward the door he came in.
It closes as he gets there.
He grabs it.
It's locked.
He sprints away into an internal hallway.
Richardson emerges from a door in the middle of the hallway.
David jumps a mile.
It's physically impossible that Richardson could have gotten there that fast.
RICHARDSON You can't get away, David.
RICHARDSON David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down an internal staircase to the floor below.
RICHARDSON Jumps the last five steps and hits the floor hard.
RICHARDSON As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is frozen solid.
RICHARDSON David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find Richardson, coming out of another office.
RICHARDSON down the hall.
RICHARDSON Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast-- David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a chloroform rag shoved right at us.
RICHARDSON FOCUS GOES IN AND OUT...
RICHARDSON FROM DAVID'S POV, BLURRY FOCUS as he's carried toward one of the large corner offices on the 40th floor.
RICHARDSON The nameplate reads "Steve Kincaid."
RICHARDSON Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David,
Except when they walk through the door they're not in an office 40 floors above lower Manhattan,: they step inside a large warehouse...
Their movement completely violates the laws of physics.
Silence.
Then voices come up slowly:
RICHARDSON Yes, sir.
RICHARDSON No, sir.
RICHARDSON No, sir.
RICHARDSON I understand that, sir.
RICHARDSON Absolutely.
RICHARDSON I'll do that, sir.
What a goddamm mess.
MCCRADY Was that Donaldson?
RICHARDSON Yes.
MCCRADY What do you want to do?
FADE UP -- BLURRY AT FIRST -- to DAVID'S POV of the warehouse David caught a glimpse of just before he passed out.
A half-dozen members of the "Intervention Team" (the Silver Suits) stand nearby.
Richardson and MCCRADY (one of the men from the rooftops) stand behind David, about 20 feet away.
RICHARDSON Can you reset him?
MCCRADY I don't think we have the authority in a situation like this.
Legal just arrived.
REVEAL BURDENSKY, a 50 year-old in a pin-stripe suit, carrying a briefcase.
He.walks to Richardson.
BURDENSKY Re-setting's off the table.
BURDENSKY This is our fault:...
BURDENSKY Richardson glances irately at Harry, who stands by himself off to the side, clearly disgraced.
BURDENSKY David, who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson, cranes around to see who's talking.
DAVID Hey.
DAVID The suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to talking amongst themselves -- though at a lower volume.
RICHARDSON What are my options?
You could bullshit him but you'll never be completely successful.
DAVID Can somebody tell me what's going on?
BURDENSKY The questions will burn in him till the day he dies.
BURDENSKY You'll have to monitor him constantly...
He can hear little snippets of what Burdensky's saying--
.to make sure he doesn't talk...
the endless ripple effects...
REVEAL David untying the rope restraining him.
BURDENSKY If it were me, I'd level with him.
RICHARDSON Completely?
BURDENSKY That's the only way to extinguish his curiosity.
BURDENSKY Richardson turns and studies David.
BURDENSKY Then walks over to him.
BURDENSKY An uncomfortable pause.
DAVID Who are you guys?
RICHARDSON We're the people v ho make sure things happen according to Plan.
RICHARDSON David stares back at him for a moment.
RICHARDSON then leaps up.
RICHARDSON His rope comes off and the chair falls.
RICHARDSON He sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse.
RICHARDSON Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand--
It cracks..
.and displaces upward..
.so it's uneven just as David's foot comes down on it.
David trips and goes flying--
MOMENTS LATER David is dragged back to the center of the room and placed back in his chair in front of Richardson.
RICHARDSON Did you really think I couldn't see that coming?
RICHARDSON David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall.
RICHARDSON (CONT'D) I can read your mind!
RICHARDSON (CONT'D) David stares back.
RICHARDSON (CONT'D) Yeah, really...
Choose a color.
Blue.
Choose a number.
Seventeen.
David's jaw drops slightly.
Richardson was clearly right.
RICHARDSON Now,.
RICHARDSON why are you still deciding whether or not to run?
RICHARDSON David's hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an atavistic response, as if;s.omehow that will keep his thoughts from spilling out into view.
RICHARDSON You saw the futility of that back at the office.
RICHARDSON David's entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking point.
RICHARDSON He can't hang on any longer to an explanation for all this based in the world he's known to date...
DAVID What the hell is happening to me?
RICHARDSON You just saw behind a curtain you weren't even supposed to know was there, Mr. Norris.
RICHARDSON Its jarring.
RICHARDSON I'm sure.
DAVID I just...
DAVID came to work...
RICHARDSON It wasn't your fault.
RICHARDSON Your Path through the world this morning was supposed to be adjusted.
RICHARDSON Your coffee was supposed to.spill onto your shirt as you left Starbucks near your apartment.
RICHARDSON You would have gone up to change and arrived at work ten minutes later than you did.
RICHARDSON By then we would have left.
People call it "chance" when their coffee spills or their internet goes down or they misplace their keys.
Sometimes it is.
Sometimes it's:us...nudging you back on Plan.
David takes all this in.
He's still shell-shocked.
DAVID Whatever you were doing to Charlie back there...
DAVID it wasn't misplacing his keys.
RICHARDSON Sometimes.
RICHARDSON when nudging a person back on Plan isn't enough we intervene directly.
DAVID Why Charlie?
DAVID What did you do to him.
RICHARDSON You need to worry about getting back on your Plan, David, not worry about us putting him back on his.
RICHARDSON David stares back, still trying to get his bearings.
RICHARDSON (CONT'D) Only a handful of human beings know what you now know, David.
RICHARDSON (CONT'D) We're determined to keep it that way.
RICHARDSON (CONT'D) So before I let you go, you need to understand something: If you ever reveal our existence we will erase your brain.
RICHARDSON (CONT'D) Your memories, your emotions, your entire personality will be expunged.
RICHARDSON (CONT'D) Your friends and family will think you've gone crazy.
RICHARDSON (CONT'D) You won't "think" anything because a blank slate can't "think."
RICHARDSON (CONT'D) Davidstares back.
RICHARDSON Do you understand what I just said?
DAVID Yes...
RICHARDSON Not a word.
RICHARDSON Not one word about us.
RICHARDSON (long beat as he studies
okay ...
you're free to go.
David stands there a monent..:.not sure it's real.
Richardson points at the door.
David walks toward it.
Just then another man comes up to Richardson.
NEW MAN IN SUIT There's awoman.
There's always & Woman...
Richardson motions;to his men.
At.-THE DOOR Two men come through from outside and block David's exit.
DAVID He said I could go.
NEW MAN IN SUIT You won't believe who she is.
NEW MAN IN SUIT He holds open a Planbook for Richardson to see.
RICHARDSON How is that possible?
RICHARDSON Why didn't we get an alert?
NEW MAN IN SUIT He wasn't supposed to be on that bus.
NEW MAN IN SUIT He was supposed to be changing his shirt in his apartment...
NEW MAN IN SUIT It was a controlled situation.
NEW MAN IN SUIT It was supposed to be.
NEW MAN IN SUIT The new man looks at Harry.
David looks back at Richardson.
DAVID You said I could go.
DAVID Richardson walks over to him.
You ran into a woman named Elise on the bus this morning?
DAVID Why does it'matter?
RICHARDSON You weren't ever supposed to see her again.
DAVID Why do you care.?
RICHARDSON Because, David, you can't be with her.
RICHARDSON And we didn't want to have to resort to this-- Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like prison guards incapacitating a prisoner.
RICHARDSON Richardson reaches into David's pocket and pulls out his wallet--
DAVID What the hell-- What are you-- Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her number on from David's wallet--
Richardson places the wallet back in David's pocket, then pulls out a lighter--
DAVID (CONT'D) No!
DAVID (CONT'D) And burns Elise's number.
DAVID (CONT'D) David strains and tries to pull loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention Team men.
DAVID (CONT'D) But he can't get free.
DAVID (CONT'D) What is wrong with you people?!
DAVID (CONT'D) Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn.
ON David's reaction CUT TO:
David exits through a steel door., it clangs shut behind him.
He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts walking to the corner to orient himself.
Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other the Brooklyn Bridge.
He's in DUMBO.
David sits alone at the bar.
His hand trembles slightly.
BARTENDER You're David Norris, right?
DAVID Ice water.
BARTENDER That's it?
BARTENDER David nods.
BARTENDER Harry arrives.
HARRY We should talk.
HARRY But not here.
HARRY Go back to work and I'll contact you later today with a place to meet.
DAVID Okay.
DAVID Harry can see that David is still very shaken.
HARRY The world's exactly the same as it's always been.
HARRY You just understand it more completely now.
Hang on to what mattered before you knew any of this and you'll be fine.
A thousand-yard stare on his face, David walks toward downtown Manhattan amid dozens of--pedestrian commuters.
David enters.
Stares at,,hisnew colleagues going about their business as if nothing happened.
David stands in ftontof the corner office labeled "Steve Kincaid."
He hesitates, then opens it.
He sees an empty office with a killer view of New-,York Harbor.
It's strangely disorienting for him.
Mr. IKincaid's in the finance meeting, Congressitan.
Main conference room.
David turns to see her.
DAVID Thanks.
DAVID David walks away, still trying to get his bearings in the new reality he now knows.
DAVID Charlie comes around a corner.
CHARLIE There you are.
CHARLIE I called your cell ten times.
CHARLIE You left me hanging.
DAVID Sorry...
CHARLIE (seeing the look in
Are you okay?
Come on, we're late.
Happy first day by the way.
They head towards the conference room.
CHARLIE You sure you're okay.
DAVID Fine.
DAVID How about you?
CHARLIE Great.
CHARLIE Why?
DAVID No headaches or--
CHARLIE I feel fantastic, -man.
CHARLIE Is it just, me or is this an odd conversation?
CHARLIE What the hell happened with the girl?
DAVID After the meeting.
LONG SHOT from outside the building.
The firm's partners sit at their weekly investment committee meeting.
David watches Charlie intently, looking for what's changed...
David and Charlie walk back to David's office.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Please explain to me why you don't have an ear-to-ear smile right now.
David hesitates.
It's like his friend is an alien..
.but then again he's totally normal.
DAVID I lost her number.
CHARLIE You lost her number?
DAVID I was pickpocketed.
CHARLIE Come on.
CHARLIE You can't be serious.
CHARLIE You're serious...
CHARLIE Oh, man...dude.
CHARLIE I'm sorry...
CHARLIE I'm really sorry...
David sits on a bench looking at the water.
The wind picks up and he puts his hands in his,coatpockets to keep them warm.
His right hand feels something.
He pulls out a ticket for the 4 pm Circle..Line tourist boat cruise.
EXT.
CIRCLE LINE CRUtgE -- DAY The boat pulls away front=the dock.
It's misting rain so there's only asmattering of tourists on-board.
David stands looking back at Manhattan.
Harry is next to him.
HARRY A lot of people just collapse when they see what you've s'een.
HARRY Their personal choices suddenly seem meaningless to them.
HARRY Life starts to feel pointless.
DAVID I was` raised to believe there's something behind the curtain.
DAVID I just never pictured it quite like this.
HARRY Most people don't.
HARRY Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his colleagues.
HARRY He's far from relaxed.
HARRY How are you feeling?
DAVID You should know.
DAVID You can read my mind, right?
Harry hesitates...as if he's not sure how much to tell David, how far to go with this.
Finally:
HARRY Richardson was just trying to scare you.
DAVID He knew what color I was thinking.
HARRY Because he set it up as a choice.
HARRY "Choose a color.
HARRY Choose a number"
DAVID So?
DAVID Harry looks away.
DAVID He's crossing a line.
DAVID He's really putting
himself out there:
HARRY We can't read your mind or hear your thoughts.
HARRY But before you make a choice your brain weighs options, and we percpite that.
HARRY We know if you're going to go off Plan "or not because, as long as we're close enough, we cansense it when it's about to happen.
DAVID it-;' s like a sixth sense for you?
HARRY Seventh, actually.
DAVID What did they do too Charlie?
HARRY Made some small change in the way he assesses risk.
DAVID What type of risk?
HARRY I don't know.
HARRY Something arcane.
HARRY Something to do with mortgage- backed securities.
DAVID That's all?
HARRY Yes.
DAVID What would your colleagues do to you if they knew what you were telling me?
DAVID This is precisely what Harry has been worried about.
HARRY That's why we're meeting out here.
DAVID They're not following me?
HARRY We don't have the manpower to follow everybody all the time.
HARRY They're checking in on you.
HARRY Just not here.
HARRY Not right now.
HARRY ON David's face considering this.
Moments later.
They stand out of earshot of the few tourists up here.
DAVID Why are you helping me?
HARRY I have my reasons.
HARRY David studies him.
HARRY Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go into
DAVID Why do they care if I'm with Elise?
HARRY Your entire reality gets shattered this morning and you want to know about a woman?
DAVID Why do they care?
DAVID Harry looks back at him.
DAVID Taken aback a bit by how much David seems to care.
HARRY I don't know.
DAVID You have no idea?
HARRY All I know is, given the amount of resources they've used, keeping you from her is pretty important to them.
HARRY You're going to look for her aren't you?
HARRY Again, David is silent.
HARRY (CONT'D) There are twelve million people in this city.
HARRY (CONT'D) On a slow day.
HARRY (CONT'D) You're not going to find her, you do realize that, don't yore-?
Even if a hypnotist pulled her number out of the recesses of your brain, no matter how many times you called it, you,'d never get through...
DAVID They send you here to tell me that?
HARRY (CONT'D) You want my advice?
HARRY (CONT'D) Forget about her.
HARRY (CONT'D) Accept that you'`>ll never see her again.
HARRY (CONT'D) Move on with your life.
HARRY (CONT'D) ON David as Harry's words sink in.
EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside David's apartment.
EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING The trees are blooming.
EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING It's Spring now.
INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING An alarm clock reads 6:29 am.
INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING David lies alone in bed.
INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING He's already awake, staring at the ceiling...
INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING After a long beat the alarm clock rings.
INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING David shuts it off.
INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING But then just lies there...
It's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now.
Instead of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six windows across.
(He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to his and knocked the walls down).
Three years have passed.
No files on the table, like there were the last time we were here.
David is on the phone in a new park-view study.
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) How are you feeling about the speech?
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and
subdued than when we last saw him.
We `hear it in his voice:
DAVID I'm ready...
DAVID I changed a few things last night.
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) Tell me at breakfast.
David finishes his call, then looks out the window.
There is a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before.
After a moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door.
EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING David exits Starbucks with a coffee.
EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING He walks across the park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different.
INT. BUS -- MORNING David enters the Ml bus.
INT. BUS -- MORNING He feeds his Metrocard into the reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders..
INT. BUS -- MORNING .more out of habit than actual hope.
INT. BUS -- MORNING He walks back to take a seat.
David stares idly out the window.
His Blackberry buzzes with a text message.
Looks down at it.
Then looks back out the window.
Suddenly his eyes snap into focus.
DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk.
David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back now.
She walks like Elise.
She's dressed in the same eclectic style.
He slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.
DAVID Stop the bus.
The next stop--
DAVID Now.
The bus stops.
David jumps out on Broadway.
FOLLOW him as he takes off across the street and runs down 12th.
He catches up to her at University Place.
DAVID Elise!
DAVID The woman turns around.
DAVID And it's her...
ELISE David?
DAVID Hi.
ELISE Wow...
ELISE How areyou.
Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then:
DAVID I rode the Ml to work every day for the last three years hoping one day I'd run into you again.
DAVID She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.
ELISE Calling would have been easier.
DAVID I couldn't.
ELISE Girlfriend wouldn't let you?
DAVID No girlfriend.
DAVID She looks at him with continued skepticism.
DAVID But his expression is dead serious.
DAVID (CONT'D) Can we go somewhere and talk?
DAVID (CONT'D) She hesitates.
DAVID (CONT'D) It hurt when he didn't call.
DAVID (CONT'D) She's angry at herself for that, but it's the truth.
ELISE Don't you have to get to work?
DAVID I just got sick.
ELISE "I haven't seen you in three years - - You make me sick" is not an ideal come-on.
ELISE For the record.
ELISE David smiles.
ELISE She's softening.
ELISE A little.
ELISE His phone vibrates.
ELISE He pulls it out of his pocket.
DAVID One second.
CharlieT can't make breakfast.
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) Why not?
DAVID And...I might have to push the speech.
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) What?
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) Are you crazy?!
DAVID I just ran into Elise.
DAVID He hangs up.
ELISE You just hung up on your best friend.
DAVID We've known each other since we were kids.
DAVID We have a shorthand.
He's not being flip or clever or smooth.
He's being matter- of-fact.
Serious.
ELISE What speech?
DAVID Doesn't matter.
DAVID Let's take a walk.
DAVID His focus on her is absolute.
DAVID But she's wary of getting reeled in again.
ELISE Where?
DAVID Somewhere far.
DAVID We have a lot to talk about.
ELISE I don't think you should cancel your speech.
ELISE What if I don't like you at the end of our walk?
DAVID I'll take my chances.
ELISE Seri6us1y, my number hasn't changed:.
ELISE Just call me like you didn't last time.
DAVID My-speech will always be there, you might not be.
I was there, David.
You didn't callrie!
DAVID Walk with me and I'll explain that.
DAVID She's still dubious.
DAVID His phone vibrates.
DAVID This time he turns it off .
DAVID (CONT'D) I'm not losing you again.
DAVID (CONT'D) I'm not letting you out of my sight.
ELISE Stalker.
DAVID Can we walk?
The moment she finally relents, CUT TO:
Polished black shoes running down a corridor on an impossibly shiny black floor with inlaid decorative silver borders.
Mr. Richardson sits at a large desk.
The design is Art Deco crossed with Albert Speer.
Downtown Manhattan is visible out the 30th floor window.
Richardson's aide enters.
MCCRADY We have a problem.
David and Elise walk north.
ELISE It's been years, David.
ELISE How do you know I don't have a boyfriend?
ELISE Oh, shit.
ELISE He hasn't even had time to think about that.
DAVID you have a boyfriend?
Would it-Matter?
Uh...yeah...
ELISE So all the stuff about me being in your mind constantly for the last three years was just talk...
ELISE The truth is you don't have any real conviction.
DAVID It wouldn't matter.
ELISE So you don't care about being a home-wrecker?
DAVID Okay...
DAVID if you were married it would matter.
ELISE Now you're just trying to say what you think I want to hear.
ELISE A beat.
ELISE She lets David twist in the wind...
ELISE I'm single.
ELISE ON David's face: relief...
ELISE Now let's hear your bullshit excuse for never calling me.
DAVID I didn't have your number.
ELISE What?
DAVID It was taken from me.
DAVID I was mugged.
ELISE Oh, come on.
DAVID Your number was in my Wallet and they ,:took it.
ELISE Come on..
DAVID I'm serious.
DAVID What else could possibly-explain my fawning all over you on that bus three years ago...and again today and not calling you in between?
Um, you had a girlfriend and you felt guilty.
I have a thing about being lied to, David.
DAVID I swear to God I didn't have your number.
DAVID I swear on my parents' graves.
DAVID (CONT'D) I didn't even have a last name to try to track you down.
DAVID (CONT'D) Do you know how many pages come back when you type "Elise" into Google?
And none of them were you.
ELISE You really are smooth.
DAVID That's not fair.
ELISE It's okay.
ELISE I like it.
ELISE I probably shouldn't, but I do.
It's Sellas.
Elise Sellas.
McCrady holds open his Planbook to show Richardson an ever shifting diagram.
RICHARDSON Tell me you're kidding.
RICHARDSON How could our Path-analysis miss this?
RICHARDSON McCrady just shakes his head, mystified...
RICHARDSON Richardson walks to the closet and pulls out his fedora:.
RICHARDSON 'rlhek,e are they now?`
MCCRADY Central Park.
MCCRADY Bethesda Fountain.
David and Elise walk past Bethesda Fountain.
ELISE I read somewhere you're running again.
DAVID I haven't announced yet but...
DAVID soon.
ELISE I hope I had a little something to do with that.
DAVID That concession speech I gave sure did.
DAVID You had everything to do with that.
DAVID Elise smiles.
DAVID You know entirely too much about me given how little I know about you.
ELISE According to Cosmo I'm supposed to keep it that way.
DAVID According to Maxim, I'm supposed to "maintain eye contact and ask you what you do for a living."
DAVID It's the first witty comment h6' :s made this time around.
DAVID He's just barely starting t6A?'looA?`en up.
I'm a dancer.
DAVID Oh..
ELISE Not like that, you pervert.
ELISE In a dance company.
ELISE The.
ELISE Manhattan Modern Ballet.
DAVID I think you have the wrong idea about me.
ELISE I think it was the first thing that crossed your mind.
DAVID Is there a performance of this company coming up that I could watch?
ELISE Actually, we have a show opening tomorrow night.
DAVID I'm there.
DAVID You hungry yet?
He points at the Boathouse restaurant a few hundred feet down the path they're on.
ELISE Yeah...
But I'm not putting out just because you're buying me brunch.
DAVID We could wait an hour and call it lunch.
ELISE I bet lines like that work wonders with the "dancers" you normally hang out with.
DAVID So unfair...
EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY Richardson and McCrady Step out of a small outdoor bar structure.
EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY They, SpotDavid and Elise walking in the side door of the restaurant.',., Somehow Richardson and' McCrady have travelled from downtown Manhattan to the middle of Central Park in the time it took David and Elise to' walk 100 feet...
David and Elise are at atable next to the lake.
WAITER Good morning.
WAITER It's good to see you again,.sir.
DAVID Thank you.
DAVID You're...
DAVID Paul, right?
DAVID De...Santo?
WAITER Wow, yeah.
WAITER How did you remember that?
WAITER It's been a year.
EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY Richardson surreptitiously watches David and Elise while McCrady consults his Planbook.
EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY A RICHARDSON AIDE steps out of the same door Richardson and McCrady came through.
Morris is on the artistic director.
Melton is on Charlie Traynor.
RICHARDSON This whole thing will be over in an hour.
MCCRADY We may not have that long.
RICHARDSON What?
INT. BOATHOUSE RESTAURANT -- DAY Thewaiter leaves David and Elise.
ELISE How do you do that?
ELISE I can't remember the names of people I just met.
DAVID David.
ELISE Right..
ELISE Thanks_.'
MCCRADY Her decision tree is diverging from our models.
36 hours without contact and she'll never speak to him again.
I've studied her file.
Her deepest fear in life is--
MCCRADY No, something is wrong.
MCCRADY I'm already seeing inflection points.
MCCRADY Off Richardson's surprised look--
INT. MAIN DINING ROOM -- DAY Davidand Elise eat brunch.
ELISE Ballet is basically impossible to do correctly.
DAVID Why?
ELISE You just do absurd things.
ELISE with your body.
ELISE The movement is completely unnatural.
ELISE It requires incredible strength in all sorts of random muscles.
ELISE And you have to be born with ridiculous amounts of flexibility in your hip or you'll never be an y good.
EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY McCrady examines his Planbook diagram.
EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY With each new update of the diagram red "inflection points" move across the pages toward a heavy black "present time" line on the right side of the right :page Richardson points at the red point closest to the present tithe ` hrie .
RICHARDSON What's that?
MCCRADY If they kiss...
A kiss, that's all it takes?
MCCRADY A real kiss.
MCCRADY But once they do that every possible adjustment that's strong enough to break them up will cause ripples over your limit.
RICHARDSON If Melton and Morris do their jobs right we'll be okay.
RICHARDSON But Richardson is clearly worried.
INT. MAIN DINING ROOM -- DAY David and Elise.
ELISE In the history of ballet there've only been a handful of people who actually did ballet the way it's supposed to be done.
ELISE Forme that just made it completely addictive.
DAVID Do you ever get nervous when people watch you?
ELISE Not really.
ELISE Do you get anxious when you make 'a speech?
DAVID I get more anxious alone in my apartment than in front of an auditorium full of people.
DAVID Everything's backwards for me.
I hate to interrupt.
They turn to see Charlie'''aynor.
I tXT.
BOATHOUSE PATIO DAY Richardson turns to a colleague, Melton, who steps through the "bar house" door.
RICHARDSON Nice work.
DAVID How did you find me?
CHARLIE Does it matter?
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Elise, pleasure to see you again.
There's a crowd of people standing around downtown waiting for you.
ELISE Your speech?
CHARLIE He's announcing today.
ELISE At the speech?
DAVID It's okay.
CHARLIE What's okay?
CHARLIE It's not okay.
CHARLIE The one thing you can't be this.
CHARLIE time around is impulsive.
CHARLIE That's why we're announcing the way we are,
ELISE God, don't skip this for me.
DAVID I told you I'm not letting you out of my sight.
CHARLIE David, what the hell?
DAVID Come with me.
DAVID Come and watch.
Okay.
Her phone buzzes with a text message.
CHARLIE Great.
CHARLIE Perfect solution.
CHARLIE Now, let's pay and get you over there.
CHARLIE Charlie waves the waiter over to give them the check.
ELISE Now?
CHARLIE The speech is in 30 minutes.
ELISE I can't then.
ELISE They just moved my dress rehearsal to noon.
ELISE David's own sixth sense kicks in.
ELISE Has he been discovered?
DAVID We can reschedule the speech.
ELISE David!
Thank you.
David looks around for anything out of the ordinary, any sign of Richardson or his men.
But.
they stay out of view.
He thinks they're not on to him yet.
ELISE I'll meet you right after the rehearsal.
DAVID Where does your company perform?
ELISE We're n in our space.
ELISE There was a`;a??power ot outage or something.
ELISE We're using a space" on Murray and West Broadway today.
That's four blocks from where you're speaking.
David reacts: Richardson can't be behind that.
CHARLIE You can literally walk there after the speech.
CHARLIE David nods, his suspicions fading.
But we've got to leave right now.
EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY Richardson and his team watch as David, convinced now he's still undiscovered, stands up and heads to the door with Charlie and Elise.

She points at the TV report on David's announcement.
You have my vote.
Mine too...
and I usually disagree with her.
DAVID Thanks.
DAVID Thanks a lot.
DAVID David turns back to Elise.
Well, you're really just a hit with women of all ages, aren't you?
On the phone.
CHARLIE I'm wrangling him right now--
DAVID Whatever happens...I'm not going to let anything stand between us this time.
DAVID It's such an odd thing to say, if you don't know what David has gone through.
DAVID She gives him a quizzical look.
DAVID But she's also moved by his,tone
ELISE Okay.:..
ELISE I believe you.

DAVID What?
CHARLIE I've just never seen you like that.
CHARLIE David can't possibly explain.
CHARLIE "I'm going to-postpone my announcement to have brunch with a woman?" Postpone any speech.

Elise changes into her dance gear.
Big smile on her face.
She spots something on her bookshelf (we can't see what) and her smile fades.
She takes it and puts it in a drawer.
Her phone vibrates.
She has a text message: "Power back on at MMB.
Rehearsal at noon."
McCrady hangs up a silver cell phone and nods at Richardson: "it's done."
Just then Richardson's phone buzzes.
The caller ID says: "Mr.

CHARLIE Good Morning America at 7am tomorrow, then you have the bankers group...
CHARLIE David, are you listening?
CHARLIE David's staring out the window.
CHARLIE The sunlight has caught the building across the street just right to illuminate Richardson and McCrady on the second floor.
I ' 11-keep you = posted, sir.
Richardson hangs up the phone and turns .t look out at David.
As he does he real zes David can see him.
RICHARDSON D` emit !
RICHARDSON Richardson-steps back out of the sunlight.
What?
RICHARDSON Get out of the sunlight.
RICHARDSON McCrady, notices David looking, jumps back out of the light.
I cannot get a break on this case.
INT. LOBBY OF RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY Charlie is trying to understand what David's staring at.
DAVID I have to see Elise now.
CHARLIE After you go back out there and talk to the New York channels--
DAVID Tomorrow.
DAVID After GMA.
DAVID He heads for the door.
DAVID Charlie follows.
CHARLIE No, we need this on the nightly-- (catching up to David and
David...
Charlie looks at him for a moment, searching for the right words to say to a friend...
CHARLIE Every time we get close..
CHARLIE .you do something to derail it.
CHARLIE A beat.
CHARLIE There's a truth to that.
CHARLIE David knows it.
CHARLIE But--
DAVID This is different.
DAVID Trust me, it's different.
DAVID David leaves.
David looks at thepiece of..paper.
An.address on West Broadway for "Nyman Studios " He's standing at the locked front door.
No one inside.
Richardson is on to him.
The surprise on his face turns to anger..
.then resolve.
He dials Elise's number on his cell.
Gets voicemail.
DAVID Elise ...I doubt you'll ever get this message but--
JUMP CUT David dials 411.
DAVID Can I have the number for the Manhattan Modern Ballet...
He looks down to see his phone has zero bars...
David goes to the saleswoman.
Through the window we see he saleswoman dial a number ...
then look at the phone and shrug.
It's dead.
She and David go to her computer.
She looks at it, puzzled.
It's dead too.
PULL BACK to REVEAL Richardson and McCrady.
MCCRADY He's going to go next door:.
MCCRADY Just then David exits the furniture store and goes next door to a clothing store--
MCCRADY You can't keep.-thephones and internet down on the whole block, for too much.
MCCRADY longer without running into ripple problems...
David enters :.and goes to an agent.
Thagent Googles "Manhattan:Modern Ballet."
Nothing shows RtAL ESTATE AGENT Could itbe called something else?
DAVID Do you have a phone book?
JUMP CUT David gets to the phone book page that ends with "Manhattan Mobile Phone Company."
JUMP CUT The next page is torn out.
JUMP CUT David slams his fist down.
David exits the office to find Richardson on the sidewalk.
With McCrady nearby.
RICHARDSON There is an entire world of women out there.
RICHARDSON I thought I made it clear this one was off limits.
RICHARDSON David takes off walking.
DAVID I must have forgotten.
DAVID It's been a while.
RICHARDSON Doesn't change the fact.
RICHARDSON David looks around, trying to figure out his next move.
DAVID Why are you so.determined to keep us apart?
RICHARDSON You know: why.
DAVID The Plan?
DAVID If there is a Pi ri you misread it.
RICHARDSON There's no misreading what the Plan says about you and Elise.
RICHARDSON It's unequivocal.
DAVID Then your Plan's wrong.
RICHARDSON Do you realize who wrote this Plan?
DAVID I don't care.
DAVID Richardson grabs him and pushes him against a brick wall.
RICHARDSON Well you should.
RICHARDSON You need to learn a little more respect.
RICHARDSON David shoves him off.
RICHARDSON Looks like he might take a swing at Richardson.
RICHARDSON Then his eye catches the complex diagram that McCrady is looking at in his Planbook.
DAVID Why are you keeping us apart?
RICHARDSON Because the Plan calls for it.
You put us together three times--
RICHARDSON That was chance.
RICHARDSON That wasn't us.
DAVID Three times?
DAVID Bullshit!
DAVID If I'm not supposed to be with her then why do I feel like this?
RICHARDSON It doesn't matter what you feel.
RICHARDSON It matters what's in black and white.
RICHARDSON David's ready to explode: at him when he sees something in Richardson's eyes.
RICHARDSON David stops..
RICHARDSON .then his whole expression changes...
DAVID You don't know, do you?
DAVID You don't know why they're keeping us apart...
'It's not something your mind could :comprehend.
DAVID You're in a nice suit but the reality is you're just a minion aren't you?
DAVID David pushes past Richardson and walks into a busy restaurant.
DAVID McCrady quickly consults his Planbook.
MCCRADY He's deciding how to--
Uh..oh--
David strides in and goes right to a chair.
Stands on it.
Excuse me ladies and gentleman-- (as people turn and look,
I'm sorry to disturb your lunch.
I have a bit of an emergency.
Is there anybody in this room who's ever seen a performance of the Manhattan Modern Ballet?
From outside, Richardson and McCrady watch.
RICHARDSON Son of a bitch.
MCCRADY He's smart.
MCCRADY He's very smart.
MCCRADY David exits the restaurant from another door.
MCCRADY He hurries toward West Broadway.
Not a taxi in sight.
David looks for one in vain.
Suddenly Richardson emerges from a storefront and, goes to David.
RICHARDSON Maybe you should try the subway.
RICHARDSON David holds him in a steely gaze.
DAVID' Don't all those cab drivers you're diverting have Plans too?
DAVID' What about all the other people looking for cabs in this part of the city right n6t?
DAVID' What about their Plans?
DAVID' The ripples must be endless...
DAVID' Richardson is taken aback that David has figuredthis out.
DAVID I don't care what you put in my way, I'm not going to give up.
DAVID David walks off, leaving Richardson standing there.
MINUTES LATER -- DAY Richardson and McCrady watch David looking for a taxi at a very busy intersection.
MCCRADY You've got two more minutes keeping taxis off West Broadway before--
I need something that's going to keep him in place longer--
On foot, David heads West towards Hudson St.
Several taxis pass with their roof lights off;.
Suddenly, down the street, he sees one with his roof light on.
He runs for.
it when-- CRASH -- twenty feet in front of him two cars collide.
Metal crunches and glass breaks.
This is no fender bender--
DAVID Jesus:.,
DAVID Is this how far you people will go?!
DAVID He rushes toward the accident--
An hour later.
Four police cars and an ambulance.
They treating one of the accident"s victims for minor scrapes ]avid is getting intervie,ved by a police officer.
POLICE OFFICER Unfortunately you're the only witness, Congressman.
DAVID How much longer?
POLICE OFFICER A few more minutes.
POLICE OFFICER I'm sorry.
POLICE OFFICER I know you have to meet somebody.
DAVID I didn't say I had to meet anyone.
POLICE OFFICER Well ...I just assumed--
Richardson is watching David get interviewed--
RICHARDSON Amateur!
RICHARDSON That's an amateur's mistake!
DAVID You're not a real cop, are you?
DAVID You're one of them.
DAVID Somebody could have been killed in that crash!
DAVID Doesn't that make you--
Sir, calm down.
But David's already walking away.
DAVID Sergeant!
DAVID He goes to the highest ranking guy on the.
DAVID scene.
DAVID I know you heed a statement from me, but do I have to stay here to give it to you or--
No, sir, we know ow to get in touch with you.
Thank you.
'.Is this man under your command?
David turns to see that the "Police Officer" who was interviewing him is gone.
David gets into a taxi.
DAVID 17th Street between 10th and 11th.
DAVID And sir, you might have to break some traffic laws getting there.
DAVID So take this.
DAVID He hands him a $100 bill.
DAVID A light that just turned green
DAVID Go through that-- The driver blows through it as it turns re
Richardson and McCrady are in front of a hip cafe arguing.
RICHARDSON I want more red liUhtss--
MCCRADY There are too many, ripples in the system..
MCCRADY Cumm.lative effects are.
MCCRADY coming into play.
RICHARDSON A traffic jam.
That's even w r.
We have to get more localize.
Richardson looks at the taxi disappearing up Hudson.
RICHARDSON He's getting out of range!
Richardson and McCrady rush through the cafe and into the KITCHEN, surprising the CHEF so completely that he can't even manage a word before they throw open the insulated door to the COLD PANTRY and run inside.
Hey!
The chef charges over and pulls open the door to find -- refrigerated food.
And nothing else.
Richardson and McCrady have disappeared.
The chef blinks.
Richardson and McCrady rush from a storage room to the showroom of a fancy art gallery.
Patrons stare as they rush straight out the front door and onto Gansevoort Street.
David's taxi is hitting all the lights iiow.
Richardson and McCrady move swiftly down the block.
Richardson heads up the stairs of a brownstone.
Opens the door to see a street in Chinatown.
He slams the door shut.
Wrong one.
(thinks)..
Two doors down.
God, I hate downtown!
EXT. 17TH ST -- DAY David's taxi heads down 17th from 8th Avenue.
Richardson and McCrady step out of the service door of a l ilding on the corner of 10th Avenue and 17th.
They can see a taxi, pulling up in front of the Manhattan Modern Ballet buildig down the block.
They run towards it.
I've got inflection points.
All they have to do is catch sight of each other this time--
RICHARDSON What?
EXT. / INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY David opens the door to Elise's dance company, oblivious to Richardson's pursuit.
LAUREN, is nearby as David speaks to the receptionist.
MUSIC comes from a door across the room.
RECEPTIONIST Is she expecting you?
RECEPTIONIST He nods.
LAUREN I hope you realize how lucky you are.
LAUREN I'm the friend.
LAUREN Lauren.
EXT. 17TH ST -- DAY Richardson dons his fedora as he races toward the studio.
RICHARDSON Can 'I block the front door?
He's already through Pit.
The next one!
Lauren walks David toward the door with the music behind it.
LAUREN It goes without saying that I'll kill you if you hurt her.
And by the way, congratulations on your announcement.
EXT. 17TH ST -- DAY Richardson and McCrady down the street.
MCCRADY There are several next ones--
I'm blocking them all-- His hand stretches out (as Harry did early on in film)
MCCRADY Wait, he's--
MUSIC pours out as David opens the door.
A quarter of the way open, the door stops dead.
Richardson grabs the front door and pulls.
It's sealed shut.
It won't budge.
MCCRADY Hat!
MCCRADY Hat!
MCCRADY McCrady is behind him He points.
MCCRADY at Richardson's fedora, which is on the sidewalk.
MCCRADY Fell off when he ran.
MCCRADY Richardson sprints to grab it--
David looks through the narrow space of the open door and sees Elise dancing.
The piece she's practicing fuses the gra e -ballet with the raw emotion of modern.
She's i? 1/2 xl eattaking.
DAVID I'm in serious trouble here...
EXT. / INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY Richardson dashes back to the door--
Forget it!
He's already there...
Richardson charges into the lobby to see David staring through the partially open door to the rehearsal room...
RICHARDSON Dammit !
RICHARDSON McCrady's phone buzzes.
RICHARDSON He pulls it out and looks at the caller ID.
It's Mr. Donaldson.
Richardson pulls the fedora off his head and crushes it in his hands.
David turns just in time to see this.
At the same time David realizes the door is no longer "stuck."
RICHARDSON Celebrate while you can.
RICHARDSON They'll just kick it upstairs now You have no idea what you're up against.
RICHARDSON David just looks at him.
RICHARDSON He'll deal with that when it comes...
MCCRADY Sir?
MCCRADY Richardson grabs the phone and answers --.going outside to talk.
MCCRADY David turns back to the dance studio.
MCCRADY He opens the door to get an unobstructed view of Elisee,.
MCCRADY She spins, arches, dips.
MCCRADY David can't take his eyes off hey` When the artistic director pauses the routine to give notes, Elise gives David a.
MCCRADY little wave.
MCCRADY Then they start again.
MCCRADY David looks back out at Richardson on the street, but he's gone..
A defeated Richardson trudges up a long flight of stairs.
Richardson walks down a hallway with an impossibly shiny black floor and enters a doorway marked "Mr.
Donaldson."
Two secretaries look up at him.
He's waiting for you.
Much larger than Richardson's office and on a higher floor.
MR.
DONALDSON, 45, sits at his desk reading a document.
After a moment he signs it at the bottom and looks up, REVEALING Richardson, who is standing awkwardly in front of his superior's desk.
Donaldson motions for him to sit down.
now.
David talks to Elise, who's showered and dressed
DAVID You're incredible.
DAVID How did you get that good?
ELISE It's all I do.
ELISE It's the only thing I ever wante& to be.
ELISE And I started young.
How young?
ELISE By third grade I was going every day after school.
DAVID That's a lot of motivation for an eight year-old.
DAVID She waves to the other dancers and receptionist in the lobby and they exit on to--
ELISE We moved around a lot then.
ELISE Dance was kind of my stability.
DAVID Sure...
DAVID it was the only constant in your life, aside from your parents...
ELISE Really more the dance.
ELISE She doesn't make a big deal of it but we get it.
DAVID Oh...
DAVID David's phone buzzes.
DAVID Caller ID shows it's Charlie.
ELISE I take it this is an unauthorized social break.
DAVID I'm a candidate for the US-:Serrate.
DAVID I don't have to punch out''when I leave.
DAVID David sends the call to voice.mai
ELISE Charlie?
DAVID Couple houtrs while I'm out of touch won't:ill him.
ELISE Couple hour, huh?
ELISE Well, we better make them,,-,--'count.
A taxi pulls tpA?a stop.- bavid 'leans over Elise to look out thew n4ow as he waits fot change from the driver.
What's this-Pi? 1/2 -
ELISE What's it look like?
ELISE We see the reflection of a dance club in the window.
DAVID I'm a terrible dancer.
DAVID I don't dance.
DAVID Elise climbs out.
DAVID David follows.
ELISE You don't now.
ELISE By the end of the night, you will.
They walk towards "Plan B", a hip joint with zebra wallpaper and fake palm trees.
Salsa music pulses from inside.
DAVID You're going to teach me to dance in one night?
DAVID Not happening.
ELISE Are you doubting me?
DAVID Yes.
DAVID She spins and shoves him against the wall.
DAVID Forcefully kisses him.
DAVID Then pulls free.
ELISE Don't.
ELISE She turns and walks into the club.
ELISE David stands there.
DAVID Holy shit...
INT. DONALDSON'S OFFICE -- DUSK Richardson sits across from Donaldson.
DONALDSON The disciplinary rules requ-te me to.
DONALDSON demote you in rank and re-assign yot to a less desirable post.
DONALDSON Donaldson A?ingers the document he just signed.
DONALDSON I'm going-'to interpret those rules loosely.
DONALDSON I'm going to go easy on you because,I feel the deck was stacked ,against you.
DONALDSON In a WIDER shot we see that both Burdensky and Donaldson's AIDE sit nearby.
DONALDSON I'm talking about the intense chemistry between them, the constant inflection points, and the kicker of course: you pulling them apart only to have "chance" put them back together.
DONALDSON Twice.
DONALDSON That seemed impossible.
DONALDSON So I asked Burdensky to do some research this morning, which he just completed.
BURDENSKY It seems like these two were meant to be together because they were meant to be together...
RICHARDSON What?!
BURDENSKY Were, in the past, in an earlier version of the plan.
BURDENSKY Actually a dozen earlier versions.
God knows how many artifacts pushing them together are left in the current plan.
A live salsa band has just started.
Elise demonstrates Mambo for David.
Couldn't be farther from the style of dance he just saw her rehearse.
But she's amazing at it.
DAVID Serious, serious.trouble...
MOMENTS LATER Salt, Patron, lime .'-.and two glasses dotin on the bar.
ELISE Ready?
ELISE Nope.
ELISE Perfect.
ELISE She yanks him onto the dance floor.
INT. DONALDSON'S OFFICE -- DUSK Donaldson, Richardson, Burdensky.
RICHARDSON Why was it changed?
DONALDSON Something important.
DONALDSON They went from "meant to be together" to "red- letter denied relationship" in a single Plan revision a few years back.
DONALDSON As for why, specifically, that's apparently above even my pay grade...
David and Elise dance.
He sucks, but doesn't care.
A couple of people in the club recognize him and give him thumbs up...
Burdensky and a dejected Richardson walk down the hall.
RICHARDSON You spend your whole career hoping that one day you'll get a "red- letter" case.
RICHARDSON Something you can really make a name for yourself with.
RICHARDSON Finally I get one...
RICHARDSON and it's.
RICHARDSON .booby-trapped...
Another set of shot glasses hit the bar.
UP to REVEAL David and Elise..
ELISE Okay, we've al-ready used up an hour, we >etter hurry.
ELISE She pills him toward the exit.
DAVID Hurry where?
Elise does a sexy, street variation on a two-step to an up- tempo pop-country ballad.
David tries to follow along, mostly by bobbing his head with the beat.
Sort of with the beat.
ELISE You've got to let yourself feel the music.
DAVID I've been told I have trouble feeling.
ELISE Whoever said that hasn't seen you speak.
DAVID That's different.
DAVID I mean--
ELISE What?
DAVID In private.
DAVID With women AlthOugh that might be changing.
DAVID Is there any style of dance you can:'t do?
David and Elise walk from the waterfront to the street.
ELISE Next stop, the best 80s club in the city.
ELISE You ready?
DAVID To make an ass of myself for the third time in one night?
DAVID A?4`r, 6'.
Race me to that light.
You lose, you dance, I watch.
You win, I dance, you watch
DAVID' What are'the rules of the race---
ELISE No rules.
DAVID Hmmm, could get ugly...
DAVID He looks down an alley as if he's noticed something.
DAVID When she looks, he takes off like a bat out of hell--
ELISE You bastard!
ELISE He's got a good lead, so he flips around and runs backwards.
DAVID Quit complaining and run.
DAVID She catches up.
DAVID He spins and digs it out.
DAVID He can't dance, but he sure can run.
DAVID He pulls away and wins.
DAVID Yes!!!!
DAVID He pumps his arms in a victory dance.
That was good.
That was very good.
DAVID You said "no rules".
DAVID She punches him in the stomach.
DAVID Hard.
DAVID He crumples, completely unprepared for it.
Sweet Jesus!
Christ on a crutch!
You said you had trouble feeling.
DAVID You're insane.
ELISE We.
ELISE need a cab.
ELISE He'laughing through the'pain.
DAVID I'm serious.
DAVID You're a maniac.
DAVID You should come with a warning label.
ELISE I do.
ELISE You just can't see it with my clothes on.
ELISE OFF David biting his lip...
ELISE and PRE-LAPPING the music--
David and Elise walk into the synthesizer prelude to "I Can't Wait" by Nu Shooz.
DAVID Doesn't this song make you feel like you're at your high school prom?
ELISE I was six when it came out.
ELISE So, not really.
ELISE Brutal.
ELISE David just shakes his head and smiles as, she pulls him to the dance floor.
MUSIC Baby...1-I-I can't wait--
STROBE LIGHTS As the song kicks in and David and Elise start dancing...
STROBE LIGHTS A couple of kids next to them notice David and start pointing and signaling their approval- The kids who first spotted David have alerted a few others.
STROBE LIGHTS More people in the crowd cheer him on.
Donaldson stares pensively out the , window,: looking down over the city.
DONALDSON'S AIDE So we're going operational?
DONALDSON'S AIDE This is exciting.
DONALDSON'S AIDE It's been a while.
We r t no ti go p etational No one ever.mad& to my job by taking stupit i? 1/2 A?ris,s .

DONALDSON And he'll thank me for giving him the opportunity.
STROBE LIGHTS David and Elise dancing.
MUSIC Cause I can't wait,.
MUSIC this .is what I've been waiting for-- People on the dance floor are literally screaming in support.
David and Elise stand on the pier outside the dance club.
ELISE You grew up over there?
ELISE She indicatesa residential area just behind the docks.
I spent any, entire childhood three blocks up Carroll Street.
We didn'.t move-` around a lot.
ELISE What were you like as a.
ELISE kid?
DAVID Before sixth grade I spent about half my time in the principal's office.
ELISE You?
ELISE Really?
DAVID The only person who spent as much time down there as me was a girl I had a huge crush on so I didn't mind too much.
A smile spreads on Elise's face.
ELISE Did your dad work here?
DAVID No...
DAVID My dad filled vending machines.
ELISE And you're going to be a senator...
DAVID After my brother died my Dad wanted to get me out of town for a while.
DAVID We went to Washington and the day we arrived he took meto the.
DAVID Capitol.
DAVID We ended up sitting in the Senate gallery;,all day.
DAVID We could see that from the end of my block, but-be never once encouraged me to go to Wall Street.

DAVID Elise,.
DAVID tucks her head into his shoulder.
ELISE I don't want tonight to mess anything..up for you, for the campaign.
DAVID Just make sure I make it to Diane Sawyer on time and I'll be fine.
DAVID Elise looks at him for a long beat.
ELISE You're different...

DAVID Believe what?
ELISE Just...
ELISE believe, period.
EXT. ELISE'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT PUSH IN on the window of an apartment.

ELISE I haven'::t lead a perfect life
DAVID I.
DAVID don't want perfect.,.

DAVID I want you in my life--
ELISE There are skeletons in my closet, David.
ELISE The kind that--

DAVID We'll work it out...
DAVID I've spent my whole life wondering why it takes auditoriums of people to fill the empty space inside me.
DAVID Then I met you...and realized it doesn't.
DAVID She looks at him.
DAVID He means it.
ELISE You scare me.
DAVID That wasn't the effect I was going for...
DAVID She smiles...then laughs out-loud--
David and Eliseirsleep peacefully.
REVEAL MR.
THOMPSON, late 50s, standing next to the bed in a suit, with a fedora on.
EXT. ELISE'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT Thompson .exits through the frt door.
EXT. ELISE'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT Three aides are waiting for him.
EXT. ELISE'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT THO Mft N'S AIDE What do you aiat to do?
Let it happen again.
7 Thompson's aides seem surprised by the answer.
David wakes to find Elise looking at him.
DAVID You been up long?
ELISE No.
DAVID Did you wake up in.
DAVID the middle of the night?
ELISE Slept straight through.
DAVID I thought you never sleep through.
ELISE I don't.
I told you, you scare me.
He kisses her.
DAVID I won't hurt you.
DAVID They kiss more...
DAVID and then get swept up by it...
They lie in bed, post-coital, drained.
Blissful.
Until the phone rings.
It's 6:17 am.
Early for a call.
ELISE Hello?
ELISE :Why, are you calling?
No...I...
Look, I have to go...
She hangs up.
David looks at her.
DAVID What's wrong..
ELISE That was my , ex.
ELISE Adrian.
DAVID Oh...
DAVID I didn't-- I guess we hadn't gotten to that stuff yet...
ELISE He hasn't called since we broke up.
DAVID How long?
ELISE Three months.
DAVID Was it serious?
An awkward beat.
Elise opts for complete honesty.
ELISE We were engaged.
DAVID What happened?
DAVID Complete honesty.
ELISE He left...
ELISE David can feel this in the pit of his stomach now.
DAVID What an idiot.
ELISE You don't know me that well yet.
ELISE You're still in the wishful thinking phase.
Truth is I should.;-Have left him a long time before he left me.
It was a ,ain' l relationship.
It hurt tb be i-h it every day.
DAVID But it was:h'ard to leave.
ELISE H& knew what buttons., tb push.
that him?
DtTid paints at pica re of Elise with an attractive man, arms wound each other.
lis'e looks surprised, shocked even, to tY%'e photo on her b okcase.
She nods.
ELISE David...
ELISE It's not...
ELISE It's over between us.
ELISE Completely over...I want to be clear about that.
ELISE I'm pretty sure yesterday was the most perfect day I've ever had.
DAVID Me too.
DAVID David looks at the clock.
DAVID I have this Diane Sawyer interview.
It comes out awkward.
ELISE I know.
ELISE So did that.
ELISE They look at each other.
ELISE Then David reaches for his clothes--
ELISE Can I come?
ELISE My dress rehearsal's not until nine.
ELISE David's face lights up.
ELISE I'm afraid if I let you out of my sight.
ELISE .you know...I might never see you again...
ELISE A smile creeps across his face...
Diane Sawyer interviewsDavid.
DIANE SAWYER You've overcome enormous obstacles in your life and risen to-such heights so quickly...
DIANE SAWYER People are fascinated by you.
DAVID Only people who haven't spent enough time with ' me to know the 'truth.
Elise watches the:nterview on a big monitor.
A soundproof window allows her tb see directly into the studio.
DIANE SAWYER As a speaker and politician you've been repeatedly compared to JFK.
DAVID By my campaign manager mostly.
You're the youngest person ever elected to Congress.
Which you celebrated by getting in a bar fight on inauguration night.
DAVID With a childhood friend.
DAVID So I don't think that counts.
DAVID And, truthfully, that's how we celebrate things we're I'm from.
DIANE SAWYER Let's just say you have a habit of getting into the press for...other uniquely human things as well--
DAVID that a euphemism, Diane?
DAVID She laughs.
DIANE SAWYER Most politicians...
DIANE SAWYER (ON TV) .run aw ay from the embarrassing things they've done Yoti,crack, jokes about them.
DIANE SAWYER (ON TV) You embrace, them.
DIANE SAWYER (ON TV) Especially since your.;, concession speech thr ee years ago which started as a `sstd-up routine and brought tears to my,eyes by the .,end when you talked about losing Your mother to Lancer and then your older brother,,Pdt, to an overdose, both whei.you:were only ten years old.
DAVID I think Americans are tired of electing automatons whose every word and move is stage-managed so as not to offend anyone.
DAVID I think they want somebody who doesn't hide who he is or what he really believes.
DAVID I guess I'm hoping they want to elect someone who's actually like them.
But I could be very wrong about that.
DIANE SAWYER And if you are?
DAVID You'd be surprised at the number of underwear companies that have approached me to be their spokesman.
DAVID Diane bursts out laughing.
DAVID The floor techs are laughing too.
And so is Elise.
She's completely smitten.
ON THE TV: Diane turns to the camera, trying to stop laughing.
DIANE SAWYER (ON TV) Unfortunately, we're out of time.
DIANE SAWYER (ON TV) David Norris, announced his candidacy for US Senate yesterday.
DIANE SAWYER (ON TV) Thanks for stopping by.
DIANE SAWYER (ON TV) It goes to commercial.
INT. STUDIO -- DAY David stays to speak to Diane for a moment-as we MOVE to find a stagehand'who is shifting the position of one of the big video cameras sed to tape the show.
INT. STUDIO -- DAY We catch a glimpse of his face and see it's Thompson's aide.
INT. STUDIO -- DAY INT<.
INT. STUDIO -- DAY Gk 2N- R0014 -- DAY The- "stagehand" moves thecamera so it's blocking the window giving Elise line-of sight to David and Diane.
INT. STUDIO -- DAY Just.
INT. STUDIO -- DAY then a man with an-.ABC ID enters the room to speak to Elise.
Ma'am, Congressman Norris asked me to give you a message.
We MOVE UP from his ID to REVEAL that the man is another one of Thompson's aides.
He was just called into a meeting that he says is urgent.
He says he'll call you later and see you at your show tonight.
INT. STUDIO -- DAY David and Diane say goodbye to each other.
INT. STUDIO -- DAY He salutes the floor staff, who actually applaud.
INT. STUDIO -- DAY They love him.
DIANE SAWYER They're saying your girlfriend -- can we call her that?
DIANE SAWYER Is this one going to last more than a month?
DAVID You can call her that.
DAVID And yes.
DAVID Definitely.
David is looking at a text from Elise as he speaks.
It says: "I want to go to bed with you."
DIANE SAWYER They're saying she's getting a tour of the control room in studio C.
DIANE SAWYER Can somebody take Congressman Norris to studio C?
DIANE SAWYER Thompson's aide signals David to follow him.
DIANE SAWYER David does.
DIANE SAWYER They walk through a couple thick doors into the corridor.
INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY Thompson's aide leads him through a heavy door marked "Studio C" into a, vestibule and then through another heavy door into--
A partially-built set in the center of an empty stage.
Elise isn't here.
Thompson's aide feigns surprise.
They said she was here...
Hang on.
David pulls his blackberry out sees there is no signal.
He looks up to see Thompson's aide exit through the stage door.
It suddenly clicks for David, and he rushes to the door.
Yanks on it.
It's locked.
DAVID God dammit!
INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY Through the thick window of the outer door we can see David pounding on the window of the inner door.
INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY But we can't hear a sound.
INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY PULL BACK to REVEAL Thompson's aide removing the"Studio C" placard.
INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY Beneath is the true designation: "Studio D."
INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY PAN to REVEAL three Thompson aides removing a false wall that was hiding a bunch of construction equipment and setting up "No Entry -- Construction Zone" signs.
1) David across the room tugs on another exit.
It's locked.
2) David pulls a fire alarm.
Nothing.
3) David slams on the door with a two-by-four.
1) Diane Sawyet talks about the issue of the day as we pull back and show her.
co-hosts on the couch.
2) Elise arrives in the lobby of the Manhattan Modern Ballet for her company's dress rehearsal.
David sits.
His tie..loose now.
His jacket off.
He glances at his blackberry.
the time reads 4:13 pm.
He yells in frustration.
If people could hear you out there it wouldn't be a very good soundstage, would it?
David turns to see Thompson, in the now familiar dark suit and fedora.
THOMPSON My name's Thompson.
DAVID What happened to Free Will?
THOMPSON Who said anything about Free Will?
THOMPSON David stares back at him.
THOMPSON You know, we actually tried Free Will before.
THOMPSON After taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the Roman Empire we stepped back to see how you'd do on your own.
THOMPSON You gave us the Dark Ages -- for
five centuries -- until finally we: decided we should come back in.
The Chairman thought maybe we just needed to do a better job of teaching you how to ride the bike before we took the training wheels off again.
So we gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revoluton.:i? 1/2 we spent six hundred years tempering your passions with reason.,then in 1910 we stepped ba i? 1/2 c again.
Within fifty yearsi? 1/2 you brought us World War I, the lepre'ssion, Fascism, the Holocaust ani capped it off by bringingtheentire planet to the brink of destruction in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
A decisiOfl was taken atthat point that we' should stop in again before A?ou did _soittething even we Cduldn't fix.
You on't have_ Free Will, David, you have the appearance of Free =Will.
DAVID You expect me.'to believe that?
You have Free Will over what tie you pick in the morning, or what beverage to order at lunch.
But humanity just isn't mature enough to have control over the important things.
DAVID If you're in control of the important things then you're incompetent cause when I look around at the world these days it seems pretty fucked.
THOMPSON It's still here.
THOMPSON If we'd left things in your hands, it wouldn't be.
DAVID Why are you trying to keep me from Elise?
DAVID Or are you just another lackey who doesn't really know?
DAVID Thompson studies David for a long beat.
DAVID Then decides it's time to level with him.
THOMPSON We put Elise in front of you three years ago to inspire you to, .g `ve that speech -- the speech that pulled you back from the brink of oblivion and, overnight, itiade.you the front runner for this coming election.
THOMPSON The intervention on Charlie was to prevent the hedge fund you had just become vice chairman of from going belly up in the sub-prime=crisis, bringing two major banks down.
THOMPSON with it, arid in , the process making you unelectable.
THOMPSON David blinks.
THOMPSON Tries to, process this...
THOMPSON : .bAVID Are you s aying you warit me to win this election?
This 'one and six mom, after it.
And t'm not just talking about `elections ' for Senate.
lowly dawns on David what Thompson is saying...
THOMPSON You can matter, David.
THOMPSON Really matter.
THOMPSON What you wanted your whole life.
THOMPSON What your father wanted when he took you to the Senate gallery when you were ten.
THOMPSON What your brother wanted when he made you promise, the day before he overdosed, that you wouldn't be like him.
DAVID Stop.
DAVID Don't tell me this.
THOMPSON Why do you think you have that yearning to be in front of people.
THOMPSON .and that terrible emptiness when you're not?
DAVID Stop.
THOMPSON David you are meant to change the world.
THOMPSON But that doesn't happen if you stay with her.
DAVID Why does it matter to you who I love?
DAVID Some skeleton of hers `is so bad I won't get elected?
DAVID I don't believe that!
THOMPSON It's not about her-:..it's about you, what being with her does to
What does that mean?!
I'm better with her than I ever was alone., You just said it.
That speech--
Yes.
The speech...
Put it this wad: in small doses, Elise was the cure.
But in large doses...
When you're enthralledwith someone she ' rubs off on you:.
Stop.
Just: stop.
THOMPSON David, the president can't be a
DAVID Stop talking.
DAVID It's not working.
I'm a politician.
I spend my life with professional liars.
With people who decide what they want and then figure out the story they have to tell to get it.
THOMPSON Why do you refuse to accept what should be completely obvious by now?
THOMPSON You've seen what we can do.
THOMPSON You can't doubt we are who we say we are.
DAVID I don't care who you are.
DAVID I don't care who's orders you're following.
THOMPSON You can't outrun your fate, David.
DAVID Who said anything about running.
THOMPSON Maybe we should just reset you.
DAVID We both know if you could have we wouldn't be standing here having this conversation...
DAVID Thompson stares back.
DAVID He's never dealt with such temerity...
THOMPSON You fight us, we will take everything from you.
DAVID You already did once.' And I'm still standing...
always knew you were out there.
We all do.
It's the one thing we have in common.
Whether we call it God or the Devil or Fate we all know you're out there, fucking with us...
THOMPSON You'd still be living in caves if it weren't for us.
You crush our dreams because they don't fit with your Plan.
Your Plan that has no space for me falling in love but somehow has room for Tsunamis and cyclones and Darfur and AIDS.
Fuck your plan.
I reject it.
I reject you.
DAVID (CONT'D) The only thing we have in this fucked up world are the choices we make.
DAVID (CONT'D) And there's nothing you can do to me that will get me sign them away.
Kill me.
Or erase me.
Or let me go.
Thompson stares back at him, dumbfounded.
A long silence,
THOMPSON It's 6:20.
THOMPSON If you leave now, you'll make Elise's show.
THOMPSON David's eyebrows go up.
THOMPSON Huh?
THOMPSON Thompson is letting him go?
David jumps into a taxi.
David sits in the back seat, taking everything in, turning it over and over in his head...
.'
Elise and twb of her colleagues "finish a dance piece.
The audience explodes into applause.
The house lights come up half way as the stage is readied for the next piece,.
David is startled to see that the man in the aisle seat next to-him is Thompson.
She's a beautiful dancer.
DAVID What do you want?
THOMPSON There's one more piece to all this I haven't told you.
THOMPSON I guess I didn't have the heart.
THOMPSON If you stay with her, it doesn't just kill your dreams, it kills hers.
DAVID What?
THOMPSON Elise is about to become one of the most famous dancers in the country...
THOMPSON and eventually one of the greatest choreographers in the world.
If she stays with you...
she ends up teaching dance to eight year-olds.
DAVID I don't believe you.
DAVID I thought we already established that.
DAVID A beat.
THOMPSON When you look back at all this, David, just remember, we tried to reason with you.
THOMPSON Thompson gets up and leaves...just as the lights go down for the next dance.
THOMPSON David watches him go...then turns around just in time to catch Elise's entrance into the dance -- a graceful jump.
THOMPSON When she lands, her ankle cracks, and she falls.
THOMPSON The audience gasps.
THOMPSON INSERT: a floor board tilted oddly.
THOMPSON It goes back to normal.
THOMPSON FIND THOMPSON: His hand slightly outstretched.
THOMPSON THE AUDIENCE instantly knows something is wrong.
THOMPSON David jumps up and runs down to the.: stage door.
THOMPSON A dancer comes from off stage and helps Elise off the floor as the show continues.
.A company staff member is examining Elise's ankle while the show goes on.
David arrives.
Sees Elise's face.
Tears streaming down her cheeks.
Seeing David...
ELISE If it's broken...my career's over.
DAVID Don't say that.
DAVID Don't.
The taxi rushes to the hospital.
David holds her.
Silently trying to comfort her.
But he can't look at her.
EXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT David carries her from the taxi into the emergency room...
David sits in a black chair, alone, staring at the floor.
INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- NIGHT Elise lies on an exam table as -a tech x-rays her ankle.
David is still staring at the floor.
He looks-up to see Thompson.
THOMPSON I always hear people saying "you yourself for what can't bla M4' hpens fih other people," but in this case, really, you can.
THOMPSON David stands up...
THOMPSON and punnhesThompson in `the face.
THOMPSON h T ompson is knocked onto his ass.
THOMPSON People in the waiting room stare at David.
THOMPSON Almost everyone here knows his fade.
THOMPSON He looks at them, unable to summon his usual wit.
THOMPSON This is what you do, David.
This is what you did the first night you got elected.
This is what you did at that college reunion.
We give you opportunities people would kill for and you squander them with impulse.
It doesn't take a genius to see Elise isn't exactly going to help you with that.
You want to know why you can't have her?
Look in the mirror.
Thompson leaves.
INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- NIGHT More X-rays of Elise's ankle.
INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- NIGHT An orthopedic surgeon enters and examines the images on the computer screen.
INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- NIGHT Elise, her face, still red and tear stained tries to read the
ELISE How bad is it?
The surgeon turns to her with a classic doctor's detachment:
David sits alone on a bench.
Thompson arrives.
THOMPSON You're an educated man.
THOMPSON You've read the Greek tragedies`.
THOMPSON In the end Fate always wins...
THOMPSON David looks back at him in steely silence.
THOMPSON It a sprain.
DAVID Really?
THOMPSON This time.
Do you really want to watch her lose the only thing she's ever cared about?
You just got the tiniest taste of what that looks like...
The thought makes David ill.
THOMPSON Walk away.
THOMPSON If you truly love her, walk away.
THOMPSON She'll hate you for it...but that way she'll be able to let you go quickly.
THOMPSON You can give her that at least.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT David stands alone.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT Stares at the floor.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT Finally confronting the fact that he can't beat the forces arrayed against him.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT Finally ready to make the choice being forced upon him...
David enters to find Elise with a huge smile on her face.
ELISE It's a sprain!
ELISE It's just a sprain!
ELISE David gives her a tight hug.
ELISE It's going to be okay.
ELISE The doctor said it would heal in' a month.
ELISE .maybe even less.
DAVID You're going to: be fine.
ELISE They want to do an MRI...to assess the ligament.
ELISE damage but.: -.
ELISE They break from them hug.
DAVID It's; going to be fine.
DAVID And as incredible of a dancer as you already are, yot're just going to get better and better...
DAVID DavidV;embraces her again, so she won't see the tears welling in his eyes.
DAVID I...I have to go make a few calls.
DAVID His voice cracks.
DAVID Elise notices.
ELISE You okay?
DAVID I'm just...happy for you...
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT David walks down a long corridor away from Elise's room.
EXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT David exits the building.
EXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT Thompson is waiting by the door.
THOMPSON You're doing the right thing, David.
THOMPSON Not just for her, and the world.
THOMPSON .but for yourself.
THOMPSON David looks at him for a beat, then turns and walks away into the night.
CLOSE on a TV screen, then PULL BACK to REVEAL the diner.
David Norris, who'has spent the last two days campaigning in the tri-lakes area, got some welcome news yesterday when the latest New York Times poll gave him a sixteen point lead over his opponent less than.a month before election dg t.
FIND Charlie.
He sits` at a booth eating breakfast as he watches TV behind the counter.
Charlie glan ces out the window ad we FIND David standing on the back of apickup truck speaking to eighty people in the parking lot.
`:It's Autumn now.
So etthing about his{,speaking style has changed.
He's not as ima ea or passion te.:Hedoesn't seem to enjoy it as much is he A?did three years ago.
Just then a campaign aide arrives at Charlie's table.
CHARLIE How's he doing?
They still love him...
Papers?
The aide hands Charlie a stack of papers: three local papers, the Times, the Journal, and the three big NYC tabloids.
CHARLIE Thanks.
The aide leaves.
Charlie glances at the front page of the Times, then reaches for the New York / Region section.
As he does the front page of the Arts section catches his eye.
There is a big photo of Elise, doing an "airborne split," accompanying an article titled "Dance Takes a Quantum Leap."
Charlie glances through the window at David who is climbing down from the pickup truck to applause from his parking lot audience.
David shakes hands with people in the aftermath of his speech.
They really do love him.
Charlie reads the New York Times.
article.
It begins: "Once in a generation a piece is created of such astounding originality and virtuosity that it single-handedly reshapes.
the.
world of dance."
As he makes his way, towards the diner'f-tom the parking lot, shaking handb and allowing his picture to be taken.
David sits down with Charlie.
DAVID I'm started.
CHARLIE I'm going to show you this because you'd find out eventually and because I want to be here when you do.
CHARLIE Charlie turns the Arts section around for David to see it.
CHARLIE Elise's photo has a noticeable impact on David.
CHARLIE He glances at the article for a moment.
CHARLIE Then Charlie points down near the bottom, at a particular
"The show's choreographer, Adrian Troussant, and lead dancer, Elise Sellas, are partners on and off stage and plan to marry in New York next week."
David stares at the words...
CHARLIE David?
CHARLIE David?
DAVID I think I need...
DAVID I...
CHARLIE Take a day off.
CHARLIE Take a couple.
CHARLIE We're sixteen points up.
Even I can't blow a lead that big.
It's pouring rain.
David walks down Carroll Street.
Most of the row houses display "Norris for Senate" signs.
Most of the housing here is run-down but this block is clearly in the early'stages of gentrification.
David pays particular attention to one row house as he passes by.
Was this his house?
There's a "Norris for Senate" sign prominently displayed in the window.
David enters this classic dive bar and goes to the bartender.
DAVID Do you still serve neighborhood guys here or just the tourists?
DAVID The bartender smiles big.
DAVID A couple people at the bar notice him.
DAVID Then others notice and they start whooping it up for him.
DAVID He doesn't know any of them-but they sure know him.
David sits under the huge aluminum roof on one of the piers, holding a bottle of beer in a soaked paper bag.
There are no walls to this structure so rainwater pours off the roof on all four sides forming virtual walls.
A figure in a suit approaches David from behind.
He turns to see the man.
DAVID Why are you here?
DAVID REVERSE to REVEAL Harry, in a suit and raincoat.
HARRY I would have come earlier but I had to wait for the rain.
HARRY Water interferes with their ability to sense your decision tree.
HARRY That's why we met on a boat last time.
I guess I'm here to set the record straight.
DAVID About what?
Thompson was lying when he said they couldn't let you be with 8lise because :it would bring out your reckless side.
DAVID Why, then?
DAVID Why do they care so much?
HARRY 8ecause.,..she's enough, David.
HARRY If you have =her r tau rtt .ght not need to fill the d side you with votes and ataplause'and dreams of one day becoming p sident...
HARRY if Harry has:looked straight into David's soul.
HARRY I've watched you a long time.
HARRY They're right to want you in the White House.
HARRY It would be good for the world.
HARRY That's important but it can't be the only thing that matters.
DAVID Why are you so different than they are?
A long beat, then:
HARRY You know, your Dad was a smart man.
HARRY He could have been a lot more -- and he wanted to be.
HARRY So did your brother.
HARRY But the Plan didn't call for that.
HARRY This hits David hard.
HARRY In my job, you implement the Plan...
And most of the time..
.you don't even know why...
I'm sorry...
DAVID My mom?
HARRY That wasn't me...
HARRY that wasn't us at all.
HARRY David takes all this in.
HARRY After a;long be t he takes a drink.
HARRY Then he offers the bottle to Harry, who h a esitates, then takes a drink as well.
DAVID When Thompson told methe choice as Elise or the White House I barely hesitated.
But the trt t i `is after making that choice I went into a free-fall...
Don't get=me wrong, it killed me to see Thompson hurt her...but I used it as an excuse.
I think I left her more to save my career than hers.
Thompson wasn't lying.
The press is already talking about me as a future president.
I'm phoning in my speeches and I'm still sixteen points up in the polls.
HARRY The public loves you.
DAVID Before I met Elise that was all that mattered.
DAVID Now I hardly notice.
DAVID She's all I think about.
Do you know where she's getting married?
HARRY Front of a judge.
HARRY Tomorrow morning.
DAVID Is she happy with him?
DAVID Tell me she is and I'll walk away.
HARRY Thompson won't let you get near that courthouse.
DAVID Harry...
DAVID is she happy?
HARRY No.
HARRY A beat.
I have to get her back..
Harry knows how unlikely that is.
DAVID Will you help me:i? 1/2  Just help me get to her...
They'll sense )tOu coming a mile away.'
DAVID What if Icould move as fast as you can?
HARRY What do you mean?
DAVID Teach me about the doors.
HARRY How do you know about that?
DAVID The first day, after they caught me, they carried me through one.I thought it was a hallucination at first.
DAVID Eventually I realized it's how you move around so fast.
DAVID If you don't want to help me because of what they'll do to you...okay, that's your choice.
DAVID But if this is about protecting me then shouldn't the choice be mine?
HARRY Do you have any idea how complicated it is to navigate through those doors...
HARRY how many thousands of permutations there are in even a simple several block journey?
DAVID You know, when I do town hall meetings I usually get introduced to forty or fifty people between when I walk, through' the door and when I start speaking.
DAVID But when I'm done with the speech I can call on each one of them by `game.
DAVID A beat...
HARRY I've seen you do that
HARRY The rain is supposed to stop in the nexthou'r.
HARRY We're going to need all night to do this.
HARRY And we're going to need aplace surrounded by water to do it.
MOMENTS LATER Harry and David stand outside a door to a dock office at the end of the pier.
MOMENTS LATER Harry dons his hat.
HARRY Put your hand on my shoulder.
HARRY And don't let go until we've crossed the threshold.
David complies.
Harry opens the door.
DAVID Are they ever locked?
HARRY Maybe if you have a defective hat.
HARRY They step through the door and onto--
Harry notices as the rain slows to a drizzle.
HARRY Hurry.
HARRY Harry runs David to the front dooraf a brownstone.
HARRY Opens the door.
HARRY They move through i into--
INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING STATION -- NIGHT Harry stops.
INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING STATION -- NIGHT David takes-his hand off Harry's shoulder.
INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING STATION -- NIGHT Still amazed by what they just did.
HARRY We're underneath Canal Street, which c as ,,A canal before rt, was a street.
HARRY This is the jcity's':pumping station for downtown Manhattan.
HARRY We're ten blocks from the courthouse.
Elise enters, smiles at the receptionist.
ELISE Floor open?
RECEPTIONIST You okay, sweetie?
ELISE I just feel like being on the floor.
RECEPTIONIST Everything still on for tomorrow?
RECEPTIONIST Elise nods, trying to cover her ambivalence.
INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING STATION -- NIGHT MUSIC BEGINS: something that recalls the sensei-pupil scenes in martial arts movies, but at the same time something fluid and lyrical (e.g.
INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING STATION -- NIGHT Yoshida Brothers, "Beyond the Deep Sea."
INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING STATION -- NIGHT ) Harry rolls out a block-by-block map of lower Manhattan.
INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING STATION -- NIGHT There are intricate red pen markings all over the map..
HARRY Lower Manhattan is a nightmare.
HARRY Layer upon layer of substrate -- that's what we call the system of doors -- has been added over time.
HARRY That makes it a lot more complex to navigate down here than it is uptown.
HARRY And a lot slower.
HARRY Harry dumps out several hundred photos of doors, interior and exterior, all below Canal Street.
HARRY You ready?
DAVID Let's go.
DAVID Harry smiles and hblds,.up a photograph of.the Manhattan County Court Building in Foley Squa:e:.
HARRY Your destination.
HARRY Courtroom Six.
The MUSIC CONTINUES".
SOURCE music here-.
Elise dances to it, freestyle.
The fluidity and extension of ballet, but none of its formality or stiffness.
DAVID North Moore St.
DAVID Just south of the coffee shop...
DAVID Red door.
DAVID I come out on Broadway, near Leonard St.
DAVID Harry looks at a photo of what David just described.
HARRY Good.
HARRY Keep going.
INT. DANCE COMPANY -- NIGHT Elise continues to dance...
DAVID (eyes closed, trying to
There's an alley in front of me.
Third door on--
HARRY Thompson's there.
DAVID Okay ...so...

DAVID The fastest path is getting to the blue door right off the bat...
HARRY But you're exposed the whole way there.

Just looks at her.
Then he leans over and wipes a tear from her face.
And he decides...
He just decides.
DAVID But at least you'll know the truth.
I saw behind the curtain, Elise.
I saw this.
He opens up Harry's Planbook.

Sees the lines shift on the page.
It startles her.
DAVID It's not in their "Plan" for us to be together.

ELISE David grabs the shield and uses it to wedge the door closed.
ELISE Kicks it in so it's jammed tight.
DAVID He's not a cop.
DAVID He's one of them.
DAVID Another body slams into the door now.
DAVID But the shield holds it shut.
ELISE Who's "them?" SLAM!
ELISE SLAM!
ELISE The door cracks--

She stops.
Awed.
Unable to speak.
DAVID Come on...
DAVID We need to lose them.
DAVID David walks her across the street and picks a door at random,
David and Elise exit through a door.
Her jaw drops.
REVERSE TO REVEAL Central Park's Sheep Meadow spread before them.
(They've exited from the building on its north edge).
Elise steps out onto the grass, touches it, falls to her knees in the rain, completely overwhelmed...
A bevy of men in hats push the ladies room door open and rush in.
They're shocked to see it's empty...
Eliselooks at David
DAVID The rain slows them down but they can track us.
DAVID We have two orthree minutes.

He can see this' so clearly in his head.
How can it notbe right?
DAVID Now you know.

DAVID And you have to leave mitie.
They'll take` dance from you.

DAVID You're not safe with me.
DAVID If you
She puts her finger to his lip.
Shhhh...
ELISE It doesn't make any sense but, right now I feel safer than I've ever felt before.
I'm staying...
The Chairman's Office is the size of the reading room at the New York Public Library.
Thirty foot high.ceilings.
A dozen assistants perform various tasks very quietly, giving it more the feel of a papal court, than a corporate office.
We see THE CHAIRMAN from behind only ..but we can still tell he is utterly calm and in complete control.
An aide comes to The Chairman's--desk,.sets two open leather folios in front of him.
Mr. Thompson has made an emergency request for the Intervention Team..
One of the folio .::documents is titled "Reset Authorization."
A dressing room door opens.
David and Elise, both soaking, exit past a startled attendant.- They walk through the store and out onto
Tiey`look for another door.
ELISE Every door?
ELISE tavid nods...as they walk into another...
Thompson and a dozen other men with hats step out into the rain, scan the horizon for any sign of their quarry.
The Chairman holds a silver pen as he flips through the case file.
EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY David and Elise head towards a door across the street from the Banana Republic.
EXT. HARLEM -- DAY They emerge through a door on the 125th Street Metro-North platform.
EXT. HARLEM -- DAY Run down the stairs to street level.
Thompson and a half-dozen minions emerge from the same dressing room David and Elise did.
The seventeen year-old attendant presses back against the wall, totally freaked now.
EXT. HARLEM -- DAY David and Elise head toward a storefront church.
EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY Thompson and his men pour out onto the street flashing NYPD badges and asking questions.
EXT. HARLEM -- DAY David and Elise enter the church and--
-- exit from a metal door in a stone facade.
PULL BACK to REVEAL that they are standing at the base of the Statue of Liberty...
Elise looks out at the harbor and the city.
Rain pelts her face.
And she smiles.
Exhilarated.
Like a prisoner who has just broken her chains...
EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY Rain bounces off the dozen long black raincoats worn by Thompson and his men.
EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY A black Suburban with under-grill police lights pulls up fast.
The Intervention Team has pinpointed an interception point.
Thompson circles his finger in the air to tell his men to saddle up, they're moving out--
Elise isstill smiling.
DAVID Let's go.
ELISE We can't keep running forever,.
ELISE David.
DAVID If they find us ...they'll take you from me.
ELISE I won't let..them.
DAVID They'll take you from here.
DAVID David touches his head'.
ELISE No, I won't let them.
ELISE She leans,-.over and kisses hi's forehead.
David and Elise exit into a hallway with eight doors on it.
DAVID Perfect.
DAVID David picks a door.
DAVID It's locked.
DAVID He tries another.
DAVID It's
locked too.
He tries a third.
Locked.
Elise tries shakes her head.
DAVID They're not supposed to be locked!
DAVID David hears sounds coming from the building's central staircase.
DAVID He looks down it to see four men in silver suits climbing up the stairs.
DING.
The elevator door down the hall opens.
More men in silver suits.
ELISE This one's open!
ELISE Elise is standing at the door to the roof.
ELISE David runs to her and they go up the stairs together to--
David pushes the roof door shut, barricades it with some concrete blocks sitting on the roof.
Rain pours down on them.
They rush to the edge of the roof.
,Three Con Edison vans are parked haphazardly on the street below.
And a dozen civilians on the sidewalk are frozen..11: ; David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the roof of the building next door is ten feet below them.
They hang their legs over the edge and jump.
They sprint across the roof of the building next door -- except somehow they find themselves running across the same roof they were just on.
David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a moment ago.
The door bangs against theme being shoved open from inside.
David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction.
At the building's edge they climb over again and...
run...
Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were on.
It's like they're in an.Escher painting.
They stop, and look at each other.
David takes her hand as Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent roofs.
They're completely surrounded.
ELISE Kiss me.
ELISE Tears well in her eyes.
ELISE And his.
ELISE Close your eyes and kiss me.
ELISE He does.
ELISE And they kiss in the rain...
ELISE I love you, David Norris.
They hold each other for a long beat ...
and then, finally, open their eyes..
.ready to accept their fate-- They see an empty roof.
The Silver Suits are gone.
And the rain has stopped.
A strange silence envelopes them...
They spin the other direction to see The Chairman, standing there, alone.
THE CHAIRMAN Hello, David...
THE CHAIRMAN Good morning, Elise.
THE CHAIRMAN His voice is gentle, paternal.
DAVID Who are you?
THE CHAIRMAN I think you know.
THE CHAIRMAN David and Elise stand in awe'-'as they realize.
DAVID You can't oti{rn Fate...
DAVID Tft , CHAIRMAN It's .more- complicated t,}an that, Fate am Free Will coexist They're;in tension with each other.
DAVID And pure chance.
DAVID A beat.
DAVID David looks back at him...
TH2;.>i? 1/2 HAT, RMAN I could control 'everything.
You'd be ha` 3 ou' d be puppets.
I try to .keep things from getting too out of control.
But that has a cost.
Most people go through life like pinballs, reacting predictably to the stimuli I apply.
They accept the path they find themselves on.
And perform accordingly.
But every once in a while someone comes along who refuses to be bound by his fate, someone who understands that Free Will is a gift most people are too afraid to use.
Which, you see, is partly the point of all this.
THE CHAIRMAN (cont'd) Or maybe you don't see it.
Maybe you just feel it.
And that's even better.
Because that's the other part.
David and Elise take it in...
DAVID And all the misery, all the pain...
THE CHAIRMAN I sit up there and I watch it and it hurts me...
THE CHAIRMAN but if you could see the incredible courage people show, the random acts of kindness, the love...
THE CHAIRMAN If you could see huitan beings choosing every moment every day to be better thAn'' I made them, you would know it's all worthwhile.
Good luck, David.
And good luck to you, Elise.
You're a-beautiful dancer.
And so much more...
The Chairman turns to his aide, who we didn't know was there.
THE CHAIRMAN Their case isclosed.
But, Sir,isn't this a majtr.
deviation from The Plan?
The Chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio open and signs- a document on -ery heavy paper.
THE CHAIRMAN Not anymc3e .
THE CHAIRMAN David and Elise watc]i The Chairman walk away, still awed by what=they've just experienced.
THE CHAIRMAN As He disappears around a corner, the sun comes out from behind the clouds ...
THE CHAIRMAN After a long beat, Elise turns back to David, as if to say "what do we do now?"
DAVID Maybe we should go dancing.
DAVID A smile slowly spreads across her face ...
