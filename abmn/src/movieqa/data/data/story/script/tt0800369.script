THOR
Written by
Ashley Miller & Zack Stentz
On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars.
Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling breeze kicks up.
A hint of what's to come.
A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set amid endless flat, arid scrubland.
A large SUV slowly moves down the street and heads out of town.
The SUV sits parked in the desert.
Suddenly, the roof panels of the SUV FOLD OPEN.
The underside of the panels house a variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point at the sky.
JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof.
She positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the constellations above.
It appears to be cobbled together from spare parts of other devices.
JANE Hurry!
JANE We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
JANE Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as well, rubbing his head.
JANE (CONT'D) Oh-- watch your head.
SELVIG Thanks.
SELVIG So what's this "anomaly"? of yours supposed to look like?
JANE It's a little different each time.
JANE Once it looked like, I don't know, melted stars, pooling in a corner of the sky.
JANE But last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon--
"Racing "?round Orion?"? I've always said you should have been a poet.
Jane reigns in her excitement.
She tries for dignity.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 1A.
JANE Hey, Darcy.
JANE Pass up the bubbly and my gloves, will you?
JANE Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and a pair of gloves through the window.
JANE Jane passes it to Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large and masculine for her small hands.
JANE He starts to unwrap the foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.
JANE (CONT'D) Not until you see it!
SELVIG I recognize those.
SELVIG Think how proud he'd be to see you now.
SELVIG Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.
JANE Thank you.
SELVIG For what?
JANE The benefit of the doubt.
JANE The two stare out at the sky expectantly.
JANE A long beat while they scan the skies.
JANE Nothing.
JANE Jane's worried.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2.
JANE (CONT'D) It's never taken this long before.
JANE (CONT'D) Darcy calls up from the front seat.
DARCY Can I turn on the radio?
JANE Sure, if you like rocking out to KFRM, "All agriculture, all the time."
JANE ? Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.
The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held together with duct tape.
Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of handwritten notes and calculations.
Selvig watches the frustrated Jane with sympathy.
JANE The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms.
JANE She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book, tracking occurrences and patterns.
JANE (CONT'D) The last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute...
JANE (CONT'D) I just don't understand.
JANE (CONT'D) Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
JANE (CONT'D) She adjusts it.
JANE (CONT'D) In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.
DARCY Jane?
DARCY Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes.
DARCY The bottle of champagne begins to vibrate.
JANE There's got to be some new variable...
JANE Or an equipment malfunction...
JANE The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around them.
JANE The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A.
DARCY I don't think there's anything wrong with your equipment...
DARCY The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it shakes more violently.
DARCY Jane and Selvig notice.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3.
They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when the cork EXPLODES out of it.
Champagne goes spewing everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.
DARCY (CONT'D) Jane?
JANE What?!
DARCY I think you want to see this.
DARCY Darcy points out the window.
DARCY Jane and Selvig look out.
DARCY Over the desert --
Churn in the sky.
The three stare, dumbfounded.
JANE Holy.
JANE Shatner.
SELVIG That's your "subtle"? aurora?!
JANE No-- yes!
JANE Let's go!
The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.
The SUV hits a bump.
Jane nearly flies out.
Selvig grabs her, yanks her back in.
Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.
JANE Isn't this great?!
JANE A thought strikes her.
JANE (CONT'D) You're seeing it too, right?
JANE (CONT'D) I'm not crazy?
SELVIG That's debateable.
SELVIG Put your seat belt on!
Winds HOWL around the SUV now.
Up ahead, spiraling down from out of the clouds comes --
Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a thousand freight trains as it touches down.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4.
Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder.
Jane clambers into the front seat, beside Darcy.
She leans way out the window, TAPING the storm.
JANE You've gotta get us closer so I can take a magnetic reading.
JANE Darcy laughs.
DARCY Yeah, right!
DARCY Good one!
DARCY Oh God, you're serious...
JANE You want those college credits or not?
The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane leaning out the window, taping the event.
The SUV disturbs two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past.
The birds take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM!
A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before them with a terrifying intensity.
The SUV rocks from the blast.
Darcy's had enough.
She turns the wheel, starts to head away.
DARCY Keep the credits.
DARCY I'll intern at Burger King.
JANE What are you doing?!
DARCY Saving our lives!
DARCY Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way.
DARCY They struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.
Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds.
Darcy slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.
The SUV swerves -- but too late.
The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending him flying.
The car SKIDS to a stop.
Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.
They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.
A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.
The three race from the SUV with flashlights.
Jane spots the man lying on the ground.
He's dressed in tattered clothing, charred and blackened.
DARCY I think that was legally your fault.
JANE Get the first aid kit.
JANE Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels next to the man.
JANE Selvig hovers, protectively.
JANE She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him clearly for the first time.
JANE He is magnificently handsome, long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted features.
JANE She cups her hands around his face, as if willing the life back into him.
JANE (CONT'D) Come on, big guy.
JANE (CONT'D) Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay?
JANE (CONT'D) Open your eyes and look at me.
JANE (CONT'D) Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as his eyes flutter open.
JANE (CONT'D) She looks deep into his confused, azure eyes, which at last focus on her own.
JANE (CONT'D) Locking onto them.
JANE (CONT'D) For a moment, they each forget to breathe.
JANE (CONT'D) The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit.
JANE (CONT'D) She freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A.
DARCY Wow.
DARCY Does he need CPR?
DARCY Because I know CPR.
DARCY A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.
DARCY She looks up at Selvig.
DARCY Back to being a scientist.
--are beautiful.
JANE --are dilating.
JANE That's a good sign.
SELVIG We still have to get him to a hospital.
After we get a reading on the storm?
SELVIG Immediately, Jane.
SELVIG Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE above their heads.
SELVIG A thought strikes her.
JANE Where did he come from?
JANE They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
glowing remnants of the storm, and into:
EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.
Questions, they've always asked questions -- this race called man, on this planet they call earth.
Passionately longing to know how they are connected to the heavens.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6.
We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds, cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our galaxy.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) In ages past, they looked to us as gods, for indeed so many times we saved them from calamity.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) We tried to show them how their world was but one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to all others by the branches of Yggdrasil...
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) Immense, sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching out into the black void of space.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...the Worlds Tree.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) Nine Realms in a universe of wonder, beauty, and terror that they barely comprehended.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) But for all their thirst for knowledge, they let our lessons fall into myth and dreams.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) Where did he come from?
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) He came from us, the proudest race of warriors the Worlds have ever seen.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) He came from this -- the greatest Realm the universe has ever known.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal
what's on the other side:
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) He came...
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) from Asgard!
Beautiful beyond imagination.
We fly over the magnificent landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city, modern yet timeless.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A.
The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled out before it.
We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.
ODIN ALLFATHER Stares out at his kingdom.
ODIN ALLFATHER The ravens fly up to the balcony, land at his side.
Odin turns away from the window.
His wife FRIGGA sits at a vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.
ODIN Do you think he's ready?
FRIGGA He thinks he is.
FRIGGA He has his father's confidence.
ODIN He'll need his father's wisdom.
FRIGGA And his humility?
FRIGGA Odin reacts.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Thor won't be alone.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Loki will be at his side to give him counsel.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Have faith in your sons.
ODIN Yes, but Thor's still a boy.
ODIN He could be a great King...
ODIN Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING.
ODIN It seems to be out of synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail as it moves.
ODIN He stares at it determinedly, concentrating, trying to stop the strange event through the force of his sheer will.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8.
Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.
A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.
...if we only had more time.
FRIGGA For once, our son needs something we cannot provide.
ODIN I can fight it a little longer...
FRIGGA No.
FRIGGA You've put it off too long!
FRIGGA I worry for you.
FRIGGA He touches her cheek.
ODIN I've destroyed demons and monsters, devastated whole worlds, laid waste to mighty kingdoms, and still you worry for me?
FRIGGA Always.
ODIN Not today.
ODIN Now come kiss your king...
ODIN while I'm still king.
ODIN He pulls her close, and they kiss.
Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall.
Banners hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the fire lit room.
Giant doors open at one end.
A huge figure silhouetted against the bright light beyond walks forward.
In slo-mo, we recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.
Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.
An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.
He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly below.
THOR Another!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A.
The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.
He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of the Hall.
We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great horns.
As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then, from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his horned headpiece.
Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony.
They stand by a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded throne room.
Nervous, brother?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9.
THOR Have you ever known me to be nervous?
LOKI There was the time in Nornheim...
THOR That wasn't nerves, brother.
THOR It was the rage of battle.
THOR How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive?
THOR The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for Thor.
LOKI As I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape.
THOR Some do battle, others just do tricks.
THOR The Attendant stifles a laugh.
THOR Loki notices, doesn't like it.
THOR He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.
THOR EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and across the terrified Attendant's hand.
THOR He SCREAMS, hurls the goblet to the ground.
THOR Loki chuckles.
THOR (CONT'D) Loki...
THOR (CONT'D) Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground.
THOR (CONT'D) They turn back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.
THOR (CONT'D) Now that was just a waste of good wine.
LOKI Just a bit of fun.
LOKI Right, my friend?
LOKI The Attendant isn't so sure.
LOKI Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED
LOKI (CONT'D) Nice feathers.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A.
THOR You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow?
LOKI I was being sincere!
THOR You're incapable of sincerity.
LOKI Am I?
LOKI He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.
LOKI (CONT'D) I've looked forward to this day as long as you have.
LOKI (CONT'D) You're my brother and my friend.
LOKI (CONT'D) Sometimes I'm envious, but never doubt that I love you.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10.
Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good liar.
Maybe both.
Thor puts an appreciative hand on his brother's shoulder.
THOR Thank you.
The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:
LOKI Give us a kiss.
THOR Stop.
THOR Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.
THOR (CONT'D) How do I look?
LOKI Like a king.
LOKI They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.
LOKI (CONT'D) It's time.
THOR You go ahead.
THOR Loki casts him a wary look.
THOR (CONT'D) I'll be along.
THOR (CONT'D) Go on.
THOR (CONT'D) Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.
VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big event.
As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE stuck in the beard.
He pulls it out, looks around, then eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.
FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his moustache, gives himself a dashing smile.
A PRETTY MAIDEN holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on dreamily.
FANDRAL Thank you, love.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Now who'd like to polish my sword for me?
FANDRAL (CONT'D) The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and the ceremony preparations going on around him.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) A HELPFUL ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Hogun turns his head, gives him a look.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Intimidated, the Attendant quickly backs away.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) We reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) She eyes the weapons on the table.
SIF I'll miss you.
Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement.
Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at the front of the hall.
They are:
VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with oversized passions to match.
FANDRAL, the consummate swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed.
HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his side.
With them walks the warrior maiden SIF.
She's clad in armor, a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled with.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 11.
VOLSTAGG I hope this goes quickly.
VOLSTAGG I'm famished.
Noooo!
VOLSTAGG Are you attached to that pretty face of yours?
VOLSTAGG Because one more word, and you won't be.
FANDRAL My, we are hungry, aren't we?
FANDRAL The others laugh, save Hogun.
FANDRAL Fandral turns to him.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Go on, Hogun.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Smile.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) You can do it.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Even you, Hogun the Grim.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Just one smile.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Hogun stares at him grimly.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) All right, half a smile.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Look, forget the smile, just show some teeth.
SIF Fandral, is it true the famous Warriors Three are ready to meet any challenge?
FANDRAL Name it, Lady Sif.
SIF Keep your mouth shut.
Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the ready, stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath the palace.
A cold BREEZE blows past them.
Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his hammer.
Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.
FRIGGA It's all right to be nervous.
THOR Why does everyone keep saying that?
THOR I'm not nervous!
FRIGGA You may be able to fool the rest of
THOR ...but never you.
THOR I know.
FRIGGA Thor, just remember that you have something even the great Allfather never had.
THOR And what is that?
FRIGGA Me for a mother.
FRIGGA She smiles.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Now don't keep your father waiting.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Frigga leaves.
Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd.
Loki and Frigga enter.
Loki takes his place at the front of the hall alongside the others.
With another blast of the horn, the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into formation.
They part to reveal --
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A.
Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor.
He holds his spear GUNGNIR before him.
Any trace of weakness in him is gone now.
He exudes all the power and majesty of a Ruler of Asgard.
Frigga joins him at his side.
He looks around the hall, casts a glance over to the Warriors.
Thor is nowhere to be seen.
Odin looks to Loki.
Loki shrugs.
Odin isn't pleased.
A murmur spreads through the crowd.
VOLSTAGG Where is he?
LOKI He said he'd be along.
LOKI Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.
VOLSTAGG What?
SIF He wants to make an entrance.
FANDRAL Well, if he doesn't show up soon, he shouldn't bother.
FANDRAL Odin looks like he's ready to feed him to his ravens.
LOKI I wouldn't worry.
LOKI Father will forgive him.
LOKI He always does.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13.
Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the lower level --
Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall behind it, catching it behind his back.
The CROWD erupts in CHEERS.
Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.
SIF Oh, please.
SIF Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.
As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold breeze picks up in the Vault.
The Guards rub their limbs to warm themselves.
They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing something's not right.
They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a pedestal.
LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them.
They look up and SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.
Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.
Frigga casts him an admonishing glance.
Thor winks up at her.
She can't help but smile.
Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.
The crowd falls silent.
Odin speaks with quiet, effortless authority.
He raises Gungnir before him.
ODIN Gungnir.
ODIN Its aim is true, its power strong.
ODIN With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning.
ODIN And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon -- that duty remains the same.
ODIN Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13A.
ODIN (CONT'D) So long entrusted with this mighty hammer, Mjolnir.
ODIN (CONT'D) Forged in the heart of a dying star, from the sacred metal of Uru.
ODIN (CONT'D) Only one may lift it.
ODIN (CONT'D) Only one is worthy.
ODIN (CONT'D) Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm.
ODIN (CONT'D) Its power has no equal -- as a weapon, to destroy, or as a tool, to build.
ODIN (CONT'D) It is a fit companion for a King.
The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now strewn with ice.
We don't see their attackers clearly, just catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large and BLUE-SKINNED.
One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns to go.
But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something standing in the shadows behind it.
As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.
They turn back around.
Now it's their turn to SCREAM.
The Ceremony continues.
ODIN Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms.
ODIN The sacred throne of Asgard.
ODIN I have sacrificed much to achieve peace.
ODIN So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace.
ODIN Responsibility, duty, honor.
ODIN These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire.
ODIN They are essential to every soldier and to every King.
ODIN The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the hall.
ODIN Thor turns back to face his father.
ODIN Odin looks upon his son with pride.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 15.
ODIN (CONT'D) Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard the Nine Realms?
THOR I swear.
ODIN Do you swear to preserve the peace?
THOR I swear.
ODIN Do you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and pledge yourself only to the good of all the Realms?
ODIN Beat.
THOR I swear.
ODIN Then on this day, I, Odin Allfather, proclaim you-- Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him.
ODIN ICE creeps across the surface of the large banners around the hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound.
ODIN Thor, his comrades, and the crowd see it too.
Frost giants...
The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the palace below.
Sif and the Warriors Three reach for their weapons, as Thor races from the hall.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16.
Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him.
Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and stop short.
Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor.
We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering remains on the floor.
They've just lost a savage battle.
Badly.
Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal creature, a fiery glow coming from within it.
It is THE DESTROYER.
It holds the Casket in its hands.
SIF The Destroyer.
I thought it was but a legend.
Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets the Casket back on its pedestal.
It moves back to its post, the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it.
Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.
FANDRAL I've never been inside the Vault before.
FANDRAL It's said the Tesseract was once held here.
The Tesseract?
I thought that was but a legend too!
SIF Shush!
SIF Odin surveys the destruction.
THOR The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16A.
ODIN They have paid with their lives.
ODIN The Destroyer did its job, and the Casket is safe.
ODIN All is well.
THOR "All is well?!"? They broke into the Weapons Vault!
THOR If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these
ODIN But they didn't.
THOR I want to know why they--
The Casket of Ancient Winters belonged to the Jotuns.
They believe it's their birthright.
THOR And if you hadn't taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms!
ODIN I have a truce with Laufey, the Jotun King.
THOR He just broke your truce!
THOR We must act!
THOR Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.
ODIN Leave us.
ODIN Thor's comrades exit.
ODIN Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.
ODIN (CONT'D) And what action would you take?
THOR March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again!
ODIN You're thinking only as a warrior!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16B.
THOR This was an act of war!
ODIN It was the act of but a few, doomed to fail.
THOR They got this far!
ODIN We will find the breach in our defenses.
ODIN It will be found, and it will be sealed.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 17.
THOR As King of Asgard, I would--
ODIN You are not King.
ODIN Not yet.
ODIN Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far as he can.
ODIN He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him.
ODIN Odin watches him go.
Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the festivities cancelled due to the events of the day.
Anger and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the massive tables.
From across the room, Loki watches him.
Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in search of his dinner.
SIF Redecorating, are we?
SIF Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.
VOLSTAGG What's this -- ?!
HOGUN I told you they'd cancel it.
FANDRAL We thought that was just you being your normal cheery self.
FANDRAL Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.
VOLSTAGG All this food -- so innocent, cast to the ground.
VOLSTAGG It breaks the heart!
VOLSTAGG Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall.
VOLSTAGG Loki calmly moves towards him.
THOR It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 18.
LOKI Who said I was wise?
THOR This was to be my day of triumph.
LOKI It will come.
LOKI In time.
If it's any consolation, I think you're right.
About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, everything.
If a few of them could penetrate the defenses of Asgard once, who's to say they won't try again.
Next time with an army?
THOR Yes, exactly!
LOKI But there's nothing we can do without defying Father.
LOKI Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye.
LOKI Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.
LOKI (CONT'D) No...
LOKI (CONT'D) stop there!
LOKI (CONT'D) I know that look!
THOR It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.
LOKI It's madness!
VOLSTAGG Madness?
VOLSTAGG What sort of madness?
LOKI Nothing!
LOKI Thor was making a jest!
THOR The safety of our Realm is no jest.
THOR We're going to Jotunheim.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19.
FANDRAL What?!
SIF Thor, of all the laws of Asgard, this is one you must not break.
SIF Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.
FANDRAL This isn't like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god.
FANDRAL This is Jotunheim.
VOLSTAGG And if the Frost Giants don't kill you, your Father will!
THOR My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket!
THOR We'd just be looking for answers.
SIF It is forbidden!
SIF Thor sizes up his friends, smiles.
SIF He proceeds to make his case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction.
THOR My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together?
THOR He turns to Fandral.
THOR (CONT'D) Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil?
FANDRAL You did.
Who led you into the most glorious of battles...
...and to delicacies so succulent, you thought you'd died and gone to Valhalla?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A.
You did.
/ You did.
He turns to Sif.
THOR And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known?
SIF I did.
True.
But I supported you...
My friends, trust me now.
We must do this.
The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no convincing him.
THOR (CONT'D) Come on.
THOR (CONT'D) You're not going to let my brother and me take all the glory, are you?
THOR (CONT'D) Loki looks startled.
LOKI What?
THOR You are coming with me...
LOKI Yes, of course!
LOKI I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone.
LOKI I will be at his side.
VOLSTAGG And I.
FANDRAL And I.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20.
HOGUN And I. The Warriors Three fight together.
SIF I fear we'll live to regret this.
VOLSTAGG If we're lucky.
Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the Palace, across the grounds.
They reach a group of ATTENDANTS who ready their battle gear for their journey.
Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD.
Hogun notices.
THOR We must first find a way to get past Heimdall.
VOLSTAGG That will be no easy task.
VOLSTAGG It's said the Gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away.
FANDRAL And he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim.
VOLSTAGG Jest not!
VOLSTAGG He heareth all!
FANDRAL Please.
FANDRAL Getting past him should be simple enough now, since he seems to be letting Frost Giants sneak by under his nose.
FANDRAL Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.
VOLSTAGG Forgive him!
VOLSTAGG He meaneth no offense!
VOLSTAGG Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.
Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind.
They ride along the most astounding path in this Realm or any other --
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 21.
Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the mists and black void of space beyond.
In the distance far ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's Observatory.
The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself, Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before them, blocking their way, staring them down.
There is something other-worldly about him, even for this Realm.
He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern, intimidating face virtually concealed by armor.
Something glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.
LOKI Keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed.
LOKI This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength.
LOKI Leave it to me.
LOKI Loki dismounts and steps forward.
HEIMDALL You're not dressed warmly enough.
HEIMDALL Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.
LOKI I'm sorry?
HEIMDALL The freezing cold of Jotunheim.
HEIMDALL It will kill you all in time, even Thor.
You think you can deceive me?
I, who watch all?
I, who can sense the flapping of a butterfly's wings a thousand worlds away?
He fixes his eyes pointedly at Fandral.
Or can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim?
Fandral looks gob-smacked.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 22.
FANDRAL That was just a bit of a jest, really...
FANDRAL Loki goes into damage control.
LOKI You must be mistaken.
LOKI We're not--
Enough.
Heimdall, may we pass?
Heimdall stares him down.
HEIMDALL For ages have I guarded Asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm.
HEIMDALL In all that time, never has an enemy slipped by my watch -- until this day.
HEIMDALL I wish to know how that happened.
THOR Then tell no one where we've gone until we've returned.
THOR Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group pass.
THOR Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles him.
VOLSTAGG What happened?
VOLSTAGG Your silver tongue turn to lead?
LOKI Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth.
LOKI Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.
Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a platform.
Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23.
HEIMDALL Be warned.
HEIMDALL I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper.
HEIMDALL If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you.
HEIMDALL You'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim.
THOR I have no plans to die today.
HEIMDALL None do.
HEIMDALL Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the apparatus of the Observatory starts up.
The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into the Observatory.
Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel.
The Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a section of space.
As a final step, Heimdall plunges his sword deeper into the control panel.
The great turret FIRES, the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.
The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor and his five comrades stand.
HEIMDALL All is ready.
HEIMDALL You may pass.
VOLSTAGG Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?
HEIMDALL To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.
VOLSTAGG Ah.
VOLSTAGG Never mind, then.
VOLSTAGG Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others, grins.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A.
THOR Come on.
THOR Don't be bashful.
THOR The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost.
THOR Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom, changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it.
THOR In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex.
A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting out of it.
Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor and his band touch down.
RUNES from the Bifrost are imprinted on the ice around them.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24.
Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards.
Thor quickly grabs him by the belt.
We see the warrior dangling precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.
THOR Come on, big fella.
THOR Up...!
THOR With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the
ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:
VOLSTAGG This belt!
VOLSTAGG This belt is now my lucky belt!
VOLSTAGG I will never remove it!
VOLSTAGG Even when bathing!
FANDRAL You bathe?
FANDRAL Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder at the frozen alien wasteland before them.
FANDRAL The whole planet is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking apart.
FANDRAL Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges and float off into space.
FANDRAL The planet's icy surface cracks and melts as far as the eye can see.
FANDRAL The ruins of a Jotun city lies in the distance.
HOGUN We shouldn't be here.
THOR Too late now.
FANDRAL Actually, it's not.
FANDRAL We could turn right around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire.
FANDRAL Could be nice.
FANDRAL Thor ignore him, heads off.
FANDRAL Loki looks around, anxious.
LOKI Perhaps we should wait.
LOKI Thor turns back to his brother.
THOR For what?
LOKI To survey the enemy.
LOKI To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25.
VOLSTAGG I'm liking that.
VOLSTAGG Gauging, surveying.
VOLSTAGG Particularly the distance part.
THOR We know all we must.
THOR It's time to act.
THOR Thor heads on.
THOR Reluctantly, the others follow.
SIF He's just got to swing his hammer...
The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland, shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold.
Loki looks around them, anxious.
Volstagg shivers.
Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.
THOR It feels good, doesn't it?
THOR To be together again, adventuring on another world?
FANDRAL Adventuring?
FANDRAL Is that what we're doing?
THOR What would you call it?
FANDRAL Freezing.
VOLSTAGG Starving.
SIF Whining.
THOR How about a song to lift our spirits?
THOR The others groan.
HOGUN No, not that!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A.
SIF Please don't make us sing again!
FANDRAL If I have to listen to Volstagg's singing voice one more time, I'll fall on my own sword!
SIF Well, now I'm on board.
SIF She and Thor share a grin.
SIF The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by warfare long ago.
SIF A TEMPLE lies before them, across a central plaza.
Where are they?
THOR Hiding.
THOR As cowards always do.
THOR Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza.
THOR Loki reluctantly follows.
THOR They don't notice as SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.
The party reaches the plaza.
They sense the Frost Giants in the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides.
The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons.
A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.
What is your business here, Asgardian?
The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 26.
THOR I speak only to your King.
THOR Not to his foot soldiers.
Then speak.
Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple, where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading waterfall.
The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and his people have endured.
LAUFEY I am Laufey, King of this Realm.
THOR And I am--
LAUFEY We know who you are, Odinson.
LAUFEY Why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world?
THOR I demand answers.
THOR Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.
LAUFEY You "demand?"?
THOR How did your people get into Asgard?
LAUFEY The house of Odin is full of traitors.
LAUFEY Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed by the Jotun King's words.
THOR Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies.
LAUFEY Your father is a murderer and a thief.
LAUFEY He stole what was ours, and left our world in ruins.
LAUFEY We have the right to reclaim the Casket.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 27.
THOR Not when you'd use it to make war against other Realms.
THOR Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.
LAUFEY And why have you come here?
LAUFEY To make peace?
LAUFEY You long for battle.
LAUFEY You crave it.
LAUFEY I see you for what you are, Thor Odinson.
LAUFEY Nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man.
THOR This boy has grown tired of your mockery.
THOR Thor takes a step towards Laufey.
THOR The other Jotuns step in front of Thor, blocking his path.
THOR We finally see the Frost Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet tall.
THOR Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores him.
LOKI Thor, stop and think.
LOKI Look around you.
LOKI We are outnumbered.
THOR Know your place, brother...
LAUFEY You should listen to his counsel.
LAUFEY You know not what your actions would unleash.
LAUFEY Laufey steps out of the shadows.
But I do.
Go now, while I still allow it.
Thor simmers.
Loki speaks up.
LOKI We will accept your most gracious offer.
LOKI The others look to Thor imploringly.
LOKI Thor stares Laufey down a beat -- then relents.
LOKI He turns to leave.
LOKI His comrades breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant nearby mutters under his breath.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28.
Run back home, little princess.
Thor stops in his tracks.
Loki goes white.
He knows what's coming.
LOKI Damn.
LOKI In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS the Jotun clear across the plaza.
LOKI The Asgardians reluctantly draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.
LOKI Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.
VOLSTAGG Silly hammer!
VOLSTAGG Has a mind of its own!
VOLSTAGG ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR around them, extending off the ends of their arms like SWORDS.
VOLSTAGG One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.
FANDRAL I'm hoping that's just decorative.
FANDRAL Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost Giant.
FANDRAL His comrades form another circle around him, separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer around once and catches it with a cocky grin.
FANDRAL He's enjoying this.
THOR Next!
THOR Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.
FANDRAL Well?
FANDRAL What move, do you think?
VOLSTAGG I say we use "The Norn's Revenge."
FANDRAL At this close range?
FANDRAL I think "The Alfheim Lunge"? is a better move.
Maybe if they were three feet tall!
No!
How about "The Randy Valkyrie"??
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28A.
HOGUN Shut up!
HOGUN Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.
HOGUN A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice.
HOGUN As the Giant hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over him.
HOGUN Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun with his mace.
HOGUN Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her double-bladed staff.
HOGUN One knocks her viciously to the ground.
SIF If you don't treat me like a lady, I won't act like a lady!
SIF She takes out the Jotun.
SIF Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at the edge of a deep crevasse.
SIF The Giant sees he's vulnerable, swipes at him.
SIF But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.
SIF The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the crevasse below.
SIF The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.
LOKI Pathetic.
LOKI He turns back to the battle.
LOKI Two Jotuns come at him from either side.
LOKI He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at once.
LOKI Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
LOKI The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet.
LOKI It's a long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.
LOKI Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.
THOR Come on!
THOR At least make it a challenge for me!
THOR He sees the Brute coming at him.
THOR The huge Jotun lands a tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice.
THOR Thor rises, grins.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B.
THOR (CONT'D) Now that's more like it!
THOR (CONT'D) He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute head over heels.
THOR (CONT'D) Thor raises his hand.
THOR (CONT'D) Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies back to his grasp.
THOR (CONT'D) Ugly and stupid.
THOR (CONT'D) Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the ground by another.
THOR (CONT'D) It raises its weapon above her.
THOR (CONT'D) Hogun sees Sif in danger.
THOR (CONT'D) He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest.
THOR (CONT'D) The Jotun falls dead.
SIF I'm so glad I taught him how to do that!
SIF Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good hits in.
VOLSTAGG You may want to put some ice on that!
VOLSTAGG The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.
VOLSTAGG Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) You may be taller, but I'm wider!
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him flying.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and sending him crashing to the ground.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) It's not too late for you to surrender.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Volstagg recovers and fights on.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) The Jotun grabs Volstagg's bare arm.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing Volstagg's flesh.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) The warrior SHOUTS in pain.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C.
Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.
Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies to catch his breath.
As the battle rages around him, he opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes out a small FLASK.
Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin.
He yells to his comrades.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Don't let them grab hold of you!
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the battle.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword stops mid ice layer.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face, and the warrior drops to one knee.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) In one quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Thank you, my lady.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) But I nearly had him!
SIF Of course you did.
SIF Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling them at Sif.
SIF Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it.
SIF She races into the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them out.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29.
A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water.
It FLASH- FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.
Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he goes.
VOLSTAGG Hang on!
VOLSTAGG Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around Hogun's legs to free him.
VOLSTAGG Hogun looks down, suddenly worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously close to hacking into Hogun's legs.
HOGUN Watch the legs!
Right.
Sorry.
Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally freeing Hogun's feet.
Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.
FANDRAL You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel?
FANDRAL Fandral lunges at the Giant.
FANDRAL The Jotun knocks his blade away.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Fair enough.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's sword and snaps it in half.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Could we stop just a moment while I get another sword?
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) The Jotun then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant through with his own weapon.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air, forming into an ICE STALAGMITE.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) It impales Fandral, rendering him helpless.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A.
Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and felling Frost Giants as he goes.
He reaches the nearly- unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach.
He fights them off.
Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.
VOLSTAGG That's unfortunate.
VOLSTAGG He hurries to his wounded comrade.
FANDRAL I may need a bit of help.
FANDRAL Not a good look, is it?
VOLSTAGG Just try not to bleed.
FANDRAL How's the face?
VOLSTAGG Flawless.
VOLSTAGG Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice stalagmite.
VOLSTAGG Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost Giants.
VOLSTAGG The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists.
VOLSTAGG Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath.
VOLSTAGG The wounded Jotun sees his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.
VOLSTAGG Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst.
VOLSTAGG But instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE -- like the Frost Giant's own skin.
VOLSTAGG The blueness spreads painlessly up Loki's arm.
VOLSTAGG He stares at it, confused.
VOLSTAGG The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the unexpected phenomenon.
VOLSTAGG Loki takes advantage of the distraction, KICKS the Giant.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30.
Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising.
He taunts the Jotuns around him.
THOR Come on!
THOR But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost Giants seize the opportunity.
THOR A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.
THOR Mjolnir falls to the ground.
THOR A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail.
THOR Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave.
THOR From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's time to pull out the big guns.
THOR He touches a wall of the palace.
THOR An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.
THOR The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet.
LOKI That can't be good.
VOLSTAGG Yes, it could!
VOLSTAGG Might be an early spring!
VOLSTAGG They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.
VOLSTAGG Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 31.
LOKI Thor, we must go!
LOKI Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust.
LOKI Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle.
THOR Then go!
SIF There are too many of them!
THOR I can stop them!
THOR The others hesitate.
THOR Jotuns break up through the ice all around them.
SIF Thor!
SIF But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.
VOLSTAGG Run!
VOLSTAGG Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give chase.
VOLSTAGG Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.
VOLSTAGG The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice.
VOLSTAGG After a
Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns.
He opens his hand, beckoning.
One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind him.
He whirls around -- BAM!
-- Mjolnir nails him square in the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand.
Thor raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground with all his might.
KRAKABOOM!
Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the Jotuns around him.
They're blasted back in a massive shockwave.
The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32.
But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the shockwave continuing to spread outwards.
It moves out to where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) What's Thor done?
LOKI Likely killed us all!
LOKI As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG.
LOKI The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
LOKI The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see.
LOKI Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him.
LOKI They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
LOKI Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger.
LOKI He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS.
LOKI They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades.
Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.
THOR Loki, we have to see.
THOR Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating.
THOR But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of the Frost Giants.
THOR And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too many, even for a Thunder God.
Actually, could you bring the mists back, please?
Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.
The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening ROAR.
A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts down onto the inner edge of the planet.
Out of the maelstrom comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --
ODIN ALLFATHER Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR.
ODIN ALLFATHER He's clad in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A.
The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks, stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.
Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath his feet raises him towards Odin.
The Asgardians start to react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face- to-face with Odin.
Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's about to happen.
Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll.
He's not the foe he once was.
The two rulers talk quietly, out of earshot of the others.
ODIN Laufey.
ODIN End this.
LAUFEY Your boy sought this out.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33.
ODIN You're right.
ODIN These are the actions of a boy.
ODIN Treat them as such.
ODIN You and I can stop this before there's further bloodshed.
ODIN Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice blade at the end of his arm.
LAUFEY We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather.
LAUFEY He'll get what he came for -- war and death.
LAUFEY Odin looks grim, determined.
ODIN So be it.
ODIN Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but Odin is quicker.
ODIN The Allfather brings his spear down upon the ice.
ODIN Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.
ODIN The other Frost Giants turn tail and run.
ODIN Thor watches the fleeing Jotuns with delight.
THOR Now!
THOR We'll finish them together!
ODIN Silence!
ODIN Odin raises his spear.
ODIN The hole in the sky opens, the Bifrost energy blasting forth from it.
ODIN The Bifrost envelops the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the hole.
ODIN The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent.
ODIN Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.
Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls.
Odin pulls Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to him.
Heimdall backs away.
THOR Why did you bring us back?
ODIN Do you realize what you've done?
ODIN What you've started?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33A.
THOR I was protecting my home.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34.
ODIN You cannot protect your friends.
ODIN How can you hope to protect a kingdom?
ODIN Odin turns to the others.
Get him to the healing room!
Sif, Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help Fandral out of the room.
THOR There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act!
THOR Odin stares at him.
THOR (CONT'D) Whatever the cost, the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt.
ODIN That's pride and vanity that talks!
ODIN Not leadership!
ODIN Have you forgotten everything I've taught you?
ODIN What of a warrior's patience, cunning?
THOR While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us!
THOR The old ways are done.
THOR You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls!
ODIN You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!
THOR And you are an old man and a fool!
THOR The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words.
THOR Odin falls quiet.
THOR When he speaks again, there's something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words.
ODIN A fool, yes!
ODIN I was a fool to think you were ready.
ODIN Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34A.
FATHER-- Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his tracks.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35.
ODIN Thor Odinson...
ODIN You have disobeyed the express command of your King.
ODIN Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war.
ODIN The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control panel.
ODIN The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along with Odin's rage.
ODIN It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor.
ODIN Odin turns angrily to his son.
ODIN (CONT'D) You are unworthy of this Realm...
ODIN (CONT'D) Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.
ODIN (CONT'D) ...unworthy of your title...
ODIN (CONT'D) He rips away Thor's cloak.
ODIN (CONT'D) ...unworthy of the loved ones you've betrayed.
ODIN (CONT'D) I hereby take from you your powers.
ODIN (CONT'D) Odin extends his hand towards his son.
ODIN (CONT'D) Mjolnir goes flying from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand.
ODIN (CONT'D) In the name of my father...
ODIN (CONT'D) A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor, disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the chest piece.
ODIN (CONT'D) ...and of his father before...
ODIN (CONT'D) Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor, including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor.
ODIN (CONT'D) I cast you out!
ODIN (CONT'D) Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and disappears in the vortex.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35A.
Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly.
He closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something quietly.
Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.
RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into its smooth surface.
The runes linger for but a moment, then disappear.
Suddenly, Odin turns and hurls the hammer into the Bifrost.
Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness.
Suddenly, he's blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV.
It swerves, the side of it coming straight at him.
It SLAMS into him, as we:
CUT TO BLACK. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36.
CUT TO BLACK. After a beat, we hear familiar voices.
I think that was legally your fault.
Get the first aid kit.
Come on, big guy.
Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay?
Open your eyes and look at me.
Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him, concerned.
She looks vulnerable and beautiful.
DARCY Wow.
DARCY Does he need CPR?
DARCY Because I know CPR.
Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their heads.
A thought strikes her.
Where did he come from?
They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again.
He sits up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise.
Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers Jane a hand up.
She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls her up.
She can't help but marvel at his strength.
JANE (CONT'D) Uh, thanks.
JANE (CONT'D) Are you okay?
JANE (CONT'D) Thor searches the ground.
THOR Hammer...
DARCY Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
DARCY That's pretty obvious.
DARCY Jane notices something on the ground around them.
DARCY She shines her flashlight down at the sand.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36A.
JANE Erik...
JANE look at this.
JANE He joins her at her side and sees it.
JANE A faint, discernible pattern is etched into the sand.
JANE They exchange a look.
JANE Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and snaps some photos of the runes.
JANE A breeze begins to blow them away.
JANE (CONT'D) We've got to move fast before anything changes.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37.
JANE (CONT'D) We need soil samples, light readings, everything.
JANE (CONT'D) She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some readings, jots them down in her notebook.
JANE (CONT'D) Selvig looks at Thor, who stares up at the sky.
SELVIG Jane, we need get him to a hospital.
SELVIG Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the cannister.
JANE Not right now.
JANE It'll take too long.
JANE County's an hour away.
JANE We'll drop him off after we're done here.
JANE Selvig looks uncertain.
Look at him, he's fine.
Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily.
THOR Father!
THOR Heimdall!
THOR I know you can hear me!
THOR Open the bridge!
JANE Okay, you and Darcy take him to the hospital, I'll stay here.
SELVIG You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert?
SELVIG Thor turns to the others, frustrated.
THOR You!
THOR What world is this?
THOR The group is intimidated by his fervor.
SELVIG It's all right, my friend.
SELVIG We're going to get you some help.
SELVIG Selvig touches Thor's shoulder.
SELVIG Thor shoves him off, grows agitated, belligerent.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37A.
THOR Where am I?!
THOR Answer me!
THOR Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it.
THOR Jane looks on, concerned.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 38.
JANE Erik, just back away...
SELVIG You're in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo.
THOR What Realm?!
THOR Alfheim?
THOR Nornheim?
DARCY Uh...
DARCY New Mexico?
DARCY Darcy raises a TASER at him.
DARCY Thor looks at the weapon, unsure what to make of it.
THOR You dare threaten Thor with so puny
Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser, ZAPPING him in the chest.
Thor convulses, falls to the ground unconscious.
Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked.
DARCY What?
DARCY He was freaking me out.
As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside.
Next time you decide to taser someone, do me a favor and make sure they're already inside the truck.
Jane, come on...
Reluctantly, Jane joins the others inside the SUV.
The SUV heads off into the distance.
Behind it, high overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky.
A last blast of Bifrost energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing into our world.
It BURNS across the desert sky like a meteor.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 39.
The SUV sits parked before the emergency room entrance.
Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two ORDERLIES set the Asgardian onto a gurney.
Jane and Darcy stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.
ADMISSIONS NURSE Name?
JANE He said it was "Thor."
JANE ? The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key at a time.
JANE Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.
T-H-O-R.
And your relationship to him?
JANE I've never met him before.
DARCY Until she hit him with the car.
JANE Grazed him, actually.
Oh, and we tasered him, too.
Must have been quite the spat.
JANE I told you, I don't know him.
JANE I just want to make sure he's okay.
ADMISSIONS NURSE I'm going to need a name and contact number.
JANE Jane Foster.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 39A.
SELVIG Oh, for God's sake...
SELVIG He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his business card.
SELVIG (CONT'D) Here.
SELVIG (CONT'D) Let's go.
SELVIG (CONT'D) Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.
Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens on a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in his arm.
NURSE Hi.
NURSE Just taking a little blood.
NURSE Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.
THOR How dare you attack the son of Odin!
NURSE I need some help!
NURSE Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.
We're trying to help you!
THOR Then bring me a healing stone, you savages!
THOR He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall.
THOR Now a couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all struggling to hold Thor down.
THOR Medical equipment goes flying, furniture overturned.
What the hell is this guy on?
Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney.
Thor looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered by this small group.
The NURSE injects him with a sedative.
THOR You're no match for the Mighty-- Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.
Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER.
A TOWNIE pulls his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge.
He climbs out, peers down below, his curiosity piqued by what he sees.
Huh.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A.
The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater.
We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW.
He reaches for the object, tries to lift it, but can't.
He redoubles his efforts, strains with all his might, with no luck.
He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious object.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41.
Huh.
The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light.
Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast desert.
He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment.
A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the Bifrost footage.
Darcy hangs them on the wall.
Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed.
He notices a monitor which displays a complex program entitled "J.
FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS"?.
He looks proud.
The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine and excitement.
JANE Darcy, when you're done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology.
JANE Remind him, he owes me.
SELVIG We might want to perform a spectral analysis.
JANE "We?"?
SELVIG I flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful.
SELVIG This is the offer Jane's been waiting for.
SELVIG She gets up, inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a rack-mounted server.
JANE You know what would be really useful?
JANE Do you still have that friend at LIGO?
SELVIG She was more than a friend.
JANE Could you call in a favor?
SELVIG You don't think this was just a magnetic storm?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A.
JANE If I'm right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night's event.
SELVIG Meaning?
SELVIG Jane heads over to a computer monitor.
SELVIG Selvig follows.
JANE Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger.
SELVIG How "big"? are we talking about?
SELVIG Jane indicates the footage on the monitor.
SELVIG As the last of the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and covered with stars.
JANE I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
DARCY A what?
SELVIG I thought you were a science major.
DARCY Political Science.
DARCY Selvig shoots Jane a confused look.
DARCY Jane shrugs.
JANE She was the only applicant.
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a "theoretical"? connection between two different points of space-time.
Darcy stares blankly.
A wormhole.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B.
Selvig looks skeptical.
Jane prints out a frame-grab off the monitor.
JANE (CONT'D) Erik, look...
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42.
Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen through the "bubble"? in the clouds.
JANE (CONT'D) What do you see here?
SELVIG Stars.
JANE Yes.
JANE But not our stars.
JANE She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her excitement.
JANE (CONT'D) This is the star alignment for our quadrant, this time of year.
JANE (CONT'D) So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off...
JANE (CONT'D) those are someone else's constellations.
JANE (CONT'D) Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
JANE (CONT'D) Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the image catches her eye.
DARCY Hey, check it out.
DARCY Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.
SELVIG Is that...?
JANE I think I left something at the hospital.
JANE As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo.
JANE Inside the Bifrost funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape of a MAN.
At the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the balcony.
As we move closer, we see it is a burdened Odin, looking out over Asgard.
Frigga enters to find Odin standing lost in thought.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42A.
FRIGGA How could you have done this?
ODIN Do you understand what he set in motion?
ODIN He's taken us to the brink of war!
FRIGGA But banishment?
FRIGGA You would lose him forever?
FRIGGA He's your son!
ODIN What would you have done?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43.
FRIGGA I would not have exiled him to a world of mortals, stripped of his powers, to suffer alone.
FRIGGA I would not have had the heart for such cruelty!
ODIN That is why I'm King.
I, too, grieve the loss of our son.
But there are some things that even I cannot undo.
FRIGGA You can bring him back.
ODIN No.
ODIN His fate is in his own hands now.
Thor awakens on a hospital bed.
He notices RESTRAINTS on his wrists now.
He pulls at them, tries to free himself, to no avail.
THOR It's not possible.
THOR He tries again, mustering all his strength.
THOR One of his hands slips free from its restraint.
Jane again faces the Admissions Nurse, with Selvig and Darcy nearby.
ADMISSIONS NURSE I'm sorry, only relatives can visit patients.
But...
I'm his wife.
Darcy stifles a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse looks doubtful.
ADMISSIONS NURSE I thought you said you didn't know him.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43A.
JANE I meant I barely know him anymore.
JANE The man he's become.
JANE He's changed.
JANE I mean, what woman really knows her husband, anyway?
ADMISSIONS NURSE None of us, dear.
ADMISSIONS NURSE He's in Room
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head down the corridor, passing the destruction of the ER Thor wrecked the previous night.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44.
They enter Thor's room.
They step inside to find Thor's bed empty.
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy quickly climb into Jane's SUV.
Jane starts the car, frustrated.
JANE Typical.
JANE I just lost my most important piece of evidence.
DARCY So now what?
JANE We find him.
SELVIG Did you see what he did in there?
SELVIG I don't know if finding him is the best idea.
JANE I want to know what that thing was, and he may have the answers.
JANE We don't have a choice.
DARCY Oo-kay.
DARCY She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.
SELVIG So we're just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him?
JANE However long it takes.
JANE Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --
She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital scrubs.
Jane and Selvig exchange a look.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44A.
Jane and Selvig emerge from the SUV, help Thor to his feet.
JANE I'm so sorry.
JANE I swear I'm not doing that on purpose.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45.
Thor looks up at the sky.
THOR Blue sky...
THOR one sun...
THOR This is Earth, isn't it?
DARCY I think you may have hit him with the car one time too many.
Let's get you some clothes.
Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell- shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a ROARING central fire.
Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING STONES.
Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him.
As he carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades, the stones begin to glow.
He crushes them to a powder.
His comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.
Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.
Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.
Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the Giant's touch turned his skin blue.
It's undamaged, back to its normal color.
VOLSTAGG We should never have let him go.
SIF There was no stopping him.
FANDRAL At least he's only banished, not dead.
FANDRAL Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.
VOLSTAGG How did the guard even know?
VOLSTAGG Loki stares at his arm.
LOKI I told him.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A.
FANDRAL What?
LOKI I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.
LOKI Though he should be flogged for taking so long.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46.
VOLSTAGG You told the guard?
LOKI I saved our lives!
LOKI And Thor's.
LOKI I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.
SIF Loki, you're the only one who can help Thor now.
SIF You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind!
LOKI And if I do, then what?
LOKI I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is.
LOKI He's arrogant.
LOKI He's reckless.
LOKI He's dangerous.
LOKI You saw how he was today.
LOKI Is that what Asgard needs from its King?
LOKI The others exchange glances, torn.
LOKI Loki has a point.
LOKI He leaves the room.
LOKI Hogun stares after him.
SIF He may speak about the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor.
VOLSTAGG True, but we should be grateful to him.
VOLSTAGG He did save our lives.
HOGUN Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin.
HOGUN The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.
FANDRAL Why is it every time you choose to speak, it has to be something dark and ominous?
HOGUN A master of magic could easily bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
HOGUN The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.
VOLSTAGG No!
VOLSTAGG Surely not!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46A.
FANDRAL Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 47.
SIF Who else could elude Heimdall's gaze with tricks of light and shadow?
VOLSTAGG The ceremony was interrupted just before Thor was named King.
SIF We should go to the Allfather.
FANDRAL And tell him what?
FANDRAL "Oh, by the way, we think your son just betrayed the throne.
FANDRAL And do us a favor.
FANDRAL Bring back Thor.
FANDRAL There's a good fellow!"?
SIF It's our duty.
SIF If any of our suspicions are right, then all of Asgard is in danger.
Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters sitting on its stand.
He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it between his forearms off its pedestal.
As he does, a blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.
The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the Destroyer rousing.
A fire starts to glow within its black metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it -- the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48.
ODIN Stop!
ODIN Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it.
ODIN Odin eyes Loki with dismay.
LOKI Am I cursed?
ODIN No.
ODIN Put the Casket down.
ODIN Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly returning to its normal form and color.
ODIN He stares at his father.
LOKI What am I?
ODIN You're my son.
LOKI What more than that?
LOKI Odin doesn't answer.
LOKI He looks suddenly weary, burdened.
LOKI Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.
LOKI (CONT'D) The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?
LOKI (CONT'D) Odin looks him in the eye.
LOKI (CONT'D) He can deny it no longer.
ODIN No.
In the aftermath of the battle, I went into the Temple, and I found a baby.
Small for a giant's offspring -- abandoned, suffering, left to die.
Laufey's son.
Loki is sent reeling by the revelation.
LOKI Laufey's son...
LOKI He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48A.
LOKI (CONT'D) Why?
LOKI (CONT'D) You were knee-deep in Jotun blood.
LOKI (CONT'D) Why would you take me?
ODIN You were an innocent child.
LOKI You took me for a purpose, what was it?
LOKI Odin doesn't answer.
LOKI (CONT'D) Tell me!
ODIN I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day, bring about an alliance, bring about a permanent peace...
ODIN through you.
ODIN But those plans no longer matter.
LOKI So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me.
ODIN Why do you twist my words?
LOKI You could have told me what I was from the beginning.
LOKI Why didn't you?
ODIN You are my son.
ODIN My blood.
ODIN I wanted only to protect you from the truth.
LOKI Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?
ODIN Don't...
LOKI It all makes sense now.
LOKI Why you favored Thor all these years.
ODIN Listen...
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48B.
LOKI Because no matter how much you claim to "love"? me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard!
LOKI Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand.
LOKI It starts to move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of the Odinsleep approaching.
LOKI Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries to fight it off.
ODIN Listen to me!
ODIN Loki strides away towards the exit.
ODIN (CONT'D) Loki!
ODIN (CONT'D) Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional, and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll.
ODIN (CONT'D) The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him.
ODIN (CONT'D) His entire body now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving trails behind him as he staggers backwards.
ODIN (CONT'D) Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a scream.
ODIN (CONT'D) He collapses to the stone floor.
ODIN (CONT'D) Loki, shocked, hurries to him.
ODIN (CONT'D) He takes Odin in his arms, calls out.
LOKI Guards!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 49.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 50.
Cars, pick-ups, and SUVs are parked around the crater, the sound of a BOISTEROUS PARTY coming from within.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 51.
It looks like the whole town has turned out.
LOCALS sit on lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk.
They watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a line to take a turn with the mysterious object.
One of them struggles and fails to lift it.
As he gives up, the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the effort.
Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their cell phones.
They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge.
An EAGER TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain from the back of the truck.
He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.
This'll do it.
He yells to the driver.
Okay, let 'er rip!
The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then STRAINS, its wheels spinning futilely, until finally the rear of the truck, along with the back wheels and axles, break off and go flying.
People dive out of the way.
The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out.
He is STAN "THE MAN"? LEE.
He looks back, shocked.
The townsfolk laugh, the party continuing.
They don't notice as --
An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop.
A Fed in a suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the crater.
He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON.
He stares down at the object which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- MJOLNIR.
He pulls out a phone.
Sir -- we've found it.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 51A.
In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks around for a t-shirt.
Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can't help but notice his reflection in the mirror.
Darcy eyes his powerful build, rippling biceps.
DARCY You know, for a crazy homeless guy, he's pretty cut.
DARCY Jane turns away.
DARCY Thor emerges from the back room, holding a t-shirt.
DARCY (CONT'D) Hey, sorry I tased you!
DARCY (CONT'D) Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the equipment there with interest.
DARCY (CONT'D) Jane hurries over to put a stop to it.
JANE Excuse me...
JANE excuse me!
JANE She leads him away from the work station.
JANE Thor holds up the
t-shirt.
On the front, it bear a sticker which reads: "HELLO, MY NAME IS DR.
DONALD BLAKE"?.
Thor looks at it, puzzled.
Jane rips the sticker off.

JANE (CONT'D) My ex.
JANE (CONT'D) Thor stares at her a beat.
JANE (CONT'D) They're the only clothes I had that'll fit you.
JANE (CONT'D) Sorry.
THOR They will suffice.
THOR Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on the wall.
JANE You're welcome.
JANE Now tell me...
JANE Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest.
JANE Jane points to his form in the Bifrost photo.
JANE (CONT'D) What were you doing, in that?
JANE (CONT'D) He glances at it, dismissive.
THOR What does anyone do in the Bifrost?
THOR Everyone stares at him.
THOR Selvig seems to recognize the word.
THOR Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down.
THOR Thor moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within the book, curious.
SELVIG The Bifrost...
SELVIG Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close to her, looking over her notations.
SELVIG She quickly closes the book.
JANE What exactly is the Bifrost?
This mortal form has grown weak.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52A.
JANE (CONT'D) Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.
Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand.
Odin lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep.
The walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight.
Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga.
She speaks softly to him.
FRIGGA I asked him to be honest with you from the beginning.
FRIGGA There should be no secrets in a family.
LOKI So why did he lie?
FRIGGA He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different.
FRIGGA You are in every way our son, Loki, and we your family.
FRIGGA You must know that.
FRIGGA Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.
You can speak to him.
He can see and hear us, even now.
LOKI How long will it last?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53.
FRIGGA I don't know.
FRIGGA This time is different.
FRIGGA We were unprepared.
LOKI I never get used to seeing him like this.
LOKI The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.
FRIGGA But he's put it off for so long now, I fear...
FRIGGA Loki takes her hand.
FRIGGA She's grateful, wipes tears from her eyes.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) You're a good son.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he really feels.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) And your brother.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.
LOKI What hope is there for Thor?
FRIGGA There's always a purpose to everything your father does.
FRIGGA Thor may yet find a way home.
FRIGGA Loki looks troubled by the revelation.
FRIGGA He rises, heads for the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS hurriedly approaching.
Enter the room, block his way out.
Loki tenses, prepared for the worst, but the guards just stand before them.
Loki is baffled.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Thor is banished.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) The line of succession falls to you.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Until he awakens, Asgard is yours.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53A.
The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki.
Another EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him.
He kneels before Loki, offers the spear to him.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Make your father proud.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) He likes the feel of it in his hand.
Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local diner.
Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a huge mound of steak and eggs.
A couple other full plates -- pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him.
Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.
JANE Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night.
JANE Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued.
JANE Jane gets flustered, looks away.
JANE (CONT'D) Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud.
DARCY And how you could eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry.
DARCY Jane shoots her a withering look.
DARCY Thor downs a cup of coffee.
THOR This drink.
THOR I like it.
DARCY Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
DARCY Isabela makes the best coffee in town.
DARCY Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.
Another!
ISABELA ALVAREZ (60), the diner's proprietor, glares at Thor from behind the counter.
JANE Sorry, Izzy.
JANE Little accident.
Yo voy a pagar la taza.
Isabela turns to a WAITRESS and starts venting quickly in Spanish.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 54A.
Did you see that?
The first time she brings a man in here, and he's a lunatic!
JANE What was that?
JANE He doesn't understand.
JANE The other patrons stare at him.
THOR It was delicious.
THOR I want another.
JANE Then you should just say so!
THOR I just did.
JANE I mean ask for it.
JANE Nicely.
THOR I meant no disrespect.
JANE All right, then no more smashing, deal?
THOR You have my word.
JANE Good.
ISABELA Morning, Pete.
ISABELA Jake.
TOWNIE PETE The usual, please, Izzy.
TOWNIE PETE Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE You missed all the excitement out at the crater.
ISABELA What crater?
ISABELA Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the Townies with interest.
TOWNIE PETE They're saying some kind of satellite crashed in the desert.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE We were having a good time with it till the Feds showed up, chased us out.
JANE Excuse me, did you say there was a satellite crash?
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE Yep.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE They said it was radioactive.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE And I had my hands all over it.
I'm probably sterile now.
Thor, unconcerned, prepares to dig into the giant pile of pancakes.
Darcy is amazed by the sight.
DARCY Oh my God, this is going on Facebook.
DARCY Darcy whips out her cellphone.
Smile!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55A.
Thor looks puzzled as she SNAPS a photo of him and his massive stack of food.
SELVIG What did the satellite look like?
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE I don't know nothing about satellites.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE But it was heavy.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE Real heavy.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE Nobody could lift it.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE This gets Thor's attention.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 56.
Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake, and pulls the Townie around to face him.
THOR Where?!
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE About twelve miles east of here.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE Thor grins, his spirits soaring, as he quickly strides out of the diner.
I wouldn't bother!
Looked like the whole Army was coming in when we left!
Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings.
Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.
JANE Where are you going?
THOR Twelve miles east of here.
THOR He starts to stride determinedly down the street.
THOR Jane walks with him.
JANE Why?
THOR To get what belongs to me.
JANE So now you own a satellite?
THOR It's not what they say it is.
JANE Whatever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs.
JANE You intend to just walk in there and take it?
THOR Yes.
THOR He stops walking.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 57.
THOR (CONT'D) If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know.
JANE Everything?
THOR All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir.
THOR Darcy looks to the others.
DARCY "Myeu-muh?"? What's "Myeu-muh?"? Jane studies Thor.
DARCY He looks sincere.
DARCY She's nearly swayed,
SELVIG Jane.
SELVIG He pulls her aside.
SELVIG Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much care for him.
Please don't do this.
JANE You know what we saw last night.
JANE This can't be a coincidence.
JANE I want to know what's in that crater.
SELVIG I'm not talking about the crater.
SELVIG I'm talking about him.
JANE He's promised us answers.
SELVIG He's delusional!
SELVIG Listen to what he's saying!
SELVIG "Thor."
SELVIG ? "Bifrost."
SELVIG ? "Mjolnir."
SELVIG ? These are the stories I grew up with as a child!
JANE I'd just be driving him out there, that's all.
SELVIG It's dangerous.
SELVIG He's dangerous.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58.
After a moment, she nods.
They head back over to Thor and Darcy.
JANE I'm sorry.
JANE I can't take you.
THOR I understand.
THOR Then this is where we say goodbye.
THOR He takes her hand and kisses it.
JANE That's...
JANE thank you.
JANE Thor bows slightly to each of them.
THOR Jane Foster...
THOR Erik Selvig...
THOR Darcy.
THOR Farewell.
THOR He heads off down the street.
THOR Selvig looks relieved.
SELVIG Now...
SELVIG let's get back to the lab.
SELVIG We have work to do.
SELVIG Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go.
SELVIG Jane looks after Thor as he walks away down the street.
Sif joins the Warriors Three as they hurry towards the Throne Room.
Two EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 59.
SIF Allfather, we must speak with you
But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see --
LOKI Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne.
LOKI He wears his horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand.
LOKI Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.
VOLSTAGG What is this?
LOKI My friends...
LOKI you haven't heard?
LOKI I am now Ruler of Asgard.
FANDRAL Where is Odin?
LOKI Father's fallen into the Odinsleep.
LOKI My mother fears he may never awaken again.
SIF We would speak with her.
SIF Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look.
SIF Loki notices.
LOKI She has refused to leave my father's bedside.
LOKI You can bring your "urgent"? matter to me, your King.
LOKI Sif covers quickly.
SIF We would ask you to end Thor's banishment.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60.
LOKI My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last.
LOKI We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim.
LOKI Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times.
LOKI Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of this.
LOKI (CONT'D) All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard.
FANDRAL Of course.
FANDRAL Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit.
FANDRAL Loki stares after them.
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street.
They're by Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped by traffic.
In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices, partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis machine from her lab.
JANE Hey!
JANE That's my stuff!
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy reach the lab, where government vehicles are parked.
SHIELD AGENTS haul equipment out of the lab and load it into waiting vans.
Other Agents strip all the equipment from inside the Pinzgauer and cart it away.
Still others emerge from her trailer, arms loaded with scientific instruments and documents.
JANE What the hell is going on here?!
JANE The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.
COULSON Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with
Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows wary.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60A.
JANE I don't care who you work for, you can't do this!
SELVIG Jane.
SELVIG This is more serious than you realize.
SELVIG Let it go.
JANE Let it go?!
JANE This is my life!
COULSON We're here investigating a security threat.
COULSON We need to appropriate your equipment and all your atmospheric data.
JANE By "appropriate"? you mean "steal?"? Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.
COULSON This should more than compensate you for your trouble.
COULSON She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.
JANE I can't just pick up replacements from RadioShack!
JANE I made most of that equipment myself!
COULSON Then I'm sure you can do it again.
JANE And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 61.
COULSON We're the good guys, Ms. Foster.
COULSON He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path.
COULSON She is fully herself, fueled by outrage.
JANE So are we!
JANE We're on the verge of
extraordinary.
Jane holds up her notebook.
JANE (CONT'D) Everything I know about this phenomenon is in this lab and in this book, and no one has the right to take it from me.
JANE (CONT'D) Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's carrying.
JANE (CONT'D) Jane is stunned.
COULSON Thank you for your cooperation.
COULSON He gets into a car.
COULSON The cars and trucks pull away.
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy enter, staring in shock at the now- empty space.
JANE Years of research, gone.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62.
DARCY They even took my iPod.
SELVIG And your back-ups?
JANE Look around!
JANE They took our back- ups.
JANE They took the back-ups of our back-ups.
DARCY I just downloaded, like, thirty songs on there.
Will you please stop talking about your iPod?!
Who are these people?
SELVIG No one knows much about them.
SELVIG But I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in gamma radiation.
SELVIG SHIELD showed up, and he was never heard from again.
JANE I'm not going to let them do this.
JANE I'm getting everything back.
SELVIG Please, let me contact one of my colleagues.
SELVIG Dr. Pym has had some dealings with these people.
SELVIG I'll e- mail him and see if he can help.
DARCY They took your laptop, too.
DARCY Annoyed, Selvig thinks.
Selvig and Jane in the Pinzgauer drive up in front of the town's rinky-dink library.
A sign in the window reads, "FREE
SELVIG I'll just be a minute.
SELVIG He climbs out and heads inside.
SELVIG Jane looks down the street and sees something that intrigues her.
Thor enters the store and approaches a PET STORE CLERK.
THOR I need a horse.
Sorry, we don't sell horses.
Just dogs, cats, birds.
THOR Then give me one of those, large enough to ride.
THOR The Pet Store Clerk looks confused.
THOR Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN.
THOR He turns to the open door.
THOR Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63.
JANE You still want a lift?
It's story time in the library, as a LIBRARIAN reads a book -- "THE SECRET HISTORY OF GIANTS"? -- to a group of kids.
"And though they're large, giants can be quiet.
You have to listen carefully for the sound of their footsteps -- because they may be closer than you think."
? Nearby, Selvig sits at a computer terminal, finishing up his e-mail.
Beside him, a KID flips through a book with interest.
The Librarian stops mid-story and calls to the Kid pleasantly.
Joshua, come sit down.
It's story time.
The Kid closes his book and joins the others.
Selvig looks over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --
He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on Scandinavian Mythology.
It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to earth.
ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and THOR, who wields Mjolnir.
On the ground below them, a group of VIKINGS kneel reverently.
He eyes the illustration, pondering.
Jane's Pinzgauer cuts off the road, heads over the rugged terrain.
Storm clouds roll in over the desert sky.
Jane drives, pumped with adrenaline, nervous and excited, as Thor sits beside her, upbeat and eager for battle.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63A.
JANE I've never done anything like this before!
JANE Have you ever done anything like this before?
JANE Thor looks amused by her excitement.
THOR Many times.
THOR You're brave to do it.
JANE They just stole my entire life's work.
JANE I really don't have anything left to lose.
THOR But you're clever.
THOR Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm.
JANE "This Realm?"? Why do you talk like that?
THOR You think me strange?
THOR Jane laughs, catches herself.
JANE Yeah.
JANE Just a little.
THOR Good strange or bad strange?
JANE I'm not quite sure yet.
JANE She looks at him, sees him staring at her.
JANE She's lost in his gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES.
JANE She quickly turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.
JANE (CONT'D) Sorry.
JANE (CONT'D) She glances back at him.
JANE (CONT'D) He's confident, determined.
JANE (CONT'D) Who are you?
JANE (CONT'D) Really?
THOR You'll see soon enough.
JANE You promised me answers.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63B.
Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.
THOR What you seek -- it's a bridge.
JANE A bridge?
JANE Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?
THOR More like a rainbow bridge.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64.
A beat.
JANE God, I hope you're not crazy.
As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside, revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond.
As we move closer, we see the glow comes from --
Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers, barricades.
Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the complex.
Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the crater.
Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work.
Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the center of it all -- Mjolnir.
Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base.
JANE That isn't a satellite crash.
JANE They would have hauled the wreckage away, not built a city around it.
JANE Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.
THOR You're going to need this.
JANE Why?-- Thunder RUMBLES overhead.
JANE She stares at him intently and takes his jacket.
THOR Stay here.
THOR Once I have Mjolnir, I will return what they stole from you.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64A.
He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his request.
THOR (CONT'D) Deal?
JANE No!
JANE Look what's down there!
JANE You can't just walk in, grab our stuff, and walk out!
THOR No.
THOR Jane looks relieved.
THOR (CONT'D) I'm going to fly out.
THOR (CONT'D) Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater.
THOR (CONT'D) The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65.
JANE Wait...
JANE But Thor is already headed towards the crater.
A NEEDLE spikes on a handheld SENSOR DEVICE.
The TECHNICIAN holding it looks over at the hammer.
Mjolnir begins to give off a subtle glow.
A bolt of lightning CRACKS across the sky above.
It's fuzzy, doesn't show much.
We widen to see we are:
A younger SHIELD agent, a TECHIE in a headset, monitors security.
AGENT SITWELL, humorless, just this side of junior, looks on, none-too-pleased.
TECHIE Feed from the keyhole.
TECHIE Can barely penetrate the cloud cover.
TECHIE The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor, SQUELCHING with static.
TECHIE It shows an SAR shot of the area, laid over a terrain map.
TECHIE (CONT'D) Tech's barely working as it is, with all the interference that thing's giving off.
TECHIE (CONT'D) He gestures towards the hammer.
TECHIE (CONT'D) He checks a computer.
TECHIE (CONT'D) Hey, we've got a commercial aircraft coming in right over us, Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.
SITWELL Reroute it, like all the others.
TECHIE Right.
TECHIE Can I get the passengers some free drinks for the trouble?
TECHIE Sitwell glares at him.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65A.
It'd be a nice gesture.
The Techie types into the computer, when he notices something on another screen, holds up a hand.
TECHIE (CONT'D) Hold a sec...
TECHIE (CONT'D) we got something outside the fence, west side...
TECHIE (CONT'D) He points at the screen.
TECHIE (CONT'D) Through the haze, it shows a THERMAL IMAGE huddled beside the fence.
SITWELL DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out.
A pair of SHIELD AGENTS (DELANCEY and JACKSON) take off in a jeep to investigate.
Sitwell looks out the window, something strange catching his attention.
We see in the window's reflection that a glow is coming from the hammer containment area.
The jeep pulls up as the Agents scan the fence with a flashlight, see nothing unusual.
Looks like we're good here.
Must have been another coyote.
Just then, the Agents notice a section of the fence has been bent up from the ground, leaving a gap.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66.
Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of the jeep.
DeLancey looks over, notices.
Jackson?
The Agents reach for their weapons.
Thor elbows the driver across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon.
Jackson slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a shotgun at Thor.
Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw.
Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker.
Sitwell talks into his radio, starting to look worried.
DeLancey, Jackson -- report.
Thor, now wearing a SHIELD rain slicker, makes his way across the base.
Another SHIELD AGENT approaches the jeep, spots the unconscious DeLancey and Jackson.
He quickly calls into his radio.
SHIELD AGENT Agents down!
SHIELD AGENT We've got a perimeter breach!
The security monitors SQUELCH with static and interference.
Sitwell holds his PDA -- even it's on the fritz.
Sitwell and the Techie watch the monitors warily.
On the monitor showing the hammer containment area, Mjolnir starts to crackle with energy.
SITWELL Get Coulson.
SITWELL Sitwell punches an alarm.
As Thor makes his way towards the crater, an alarm sounds and SECURITY LIGHTS explode to life.
A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the ridge towards Jane.
She ducks down, out of sight.
She pulls out her cellphone and dials.
We hear Selvig's recorded message.
You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
Please leave me a message.
His voicemail BEEPS.
She talks quietly, urgently.
JANE Erik, okay, first of all, don't worry.
JANE I'm perfectly fine, really.
JANE More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.
JANE (CONT'D) But if you don't hear from me again, you might want to come out to the crater site and look for me.
JANE (CONT'D) I kind of did what you said I shouldn't do.
JANE (CONT'D) Thanks.
JANE (CONT'D) Bye.
JANE (CONT'D) She hangs up.
Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches across the mud, radio to his ear.
He looks out across the lit up site uneasily.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67.
A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand.
From the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him.
As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly rushes towards him and chokes him out.
He falls to the ground.
Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the fallen Guard.
He stares down at the weapon quizzically.
As more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes cover in the shadows of the trailer.
The Guards pass by.
Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main entrance tube to the center of the site.
A bright light suddenly illuminates his face.
He looks to see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight right on him.
Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him.
The Driver raises his radio to report.
Thor knows he has to act fact.
He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and catches it by the barrel.
He rears the weapon back, then hurls it like a hammer.
It flies through the air, smashing the ATV's spotlight.
Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off the wheel to protect himself.
The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube entrance.
The Guards notice and chase after it.
Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning the site entrance.
The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches the crater lip.
The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads straight for one of the plastic tunnels.
The Technicians inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the tunnel, sending sparks everywhere.
The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around it and the Driver.
SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67A.
Jane peers over the ridge, stares down at the frenzied aftermath of the ATV crash, at the base on high alert.
Lightning CRACKS in the sky behind her.
Coulson climbs to the lip of the crater as a light rain begins to fall.
He eyes the damage of the ATV crash.
He's not pleased.
The light rain becomes a downpour.
As SHIELD Agents pull the ATV driver from the wreckage, Thor races towards the unguarded entrance to the tunnels and heads inside.
Thor races up the entrance ramp.
Before him, two GUARDS round the corner.
Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second.
He hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder ahead.
Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him.
Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase.
Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through the translucent walls of the tunnels.
He hurries through to tunnels to find a way towards it.
Coulson stands on the crater lip, barking out orders, as the Guards in the tunnel rush to cut off Thor.
Coulson activates his radio.
COULSON I want eyes up high.
COULSON With a gun.
COULSON Now!

Thor takes him out with a punch to the gut, then turns to see more AGENTS coming towards him.
Thor picks up the fallen Guard he punched, then throws him into the approaching Agents, scattering them.
Thor turns around, runs back the way he came.
The Agents give chase.
Jane looks down at the crater through binoculars, frustrated that she can't clearly see what's happening.

He heads off for the command trailer to enter the tunnels.
The crane basket ascends into the high winds as Barton readies his sniper rifle.

Overlooking the complex.
It's a clear field of vision, nowhere to hide.
A digital read-out gives information on the distance to the target.
He locks in on Thor, who's inside the plastic tubing, emerging from the junction box and heading towards the cube structure.
Hello, handsome.
Thor races through the tunnel, comes across a wall of AGENTS.
Thor ROARS and barrels through them -- elbowing, punching -- whatever it takes to keep moving.
As he takes down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction box and the entrance to the cube structure up ahead.
He races towards it.
He can actually see Mjolnir within the middle of the structure, when -- BAM!
From out of nowhere, a fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw, sending him reeling.
Dazed, Thor looks up to see --
The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer in the cube structure beyond.
Thor sizes him up.
THOR You're big.
THOR Thor grins.
THOR (CONT'D) Fought bigger.
Thor and the Huge Agent explode through the wall of the junction box, then crash into the mud, sending them sliding.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 68A.
Barton has Thor in his sites.
The sniper stands still as a statue.
Coulson hurries through the tunnel, ready to give the word to Barton, when he stops short.
He sees what looks like an electrical storm erupting inside the structure ahead, directly above the crater...
and the hammer.
Jane sees SHIELD Agents and Guards swarming into the cube containment structure.
JANE No...
Thor and the Huge Agent struggle to stand in the mud.
Through the translucent walls of the cube structure, Thor sees Mjolnir.
The Huge Agent rises up before him, blocking his view.
Rain and blood run down Thor's face.
He lunges forward, whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing the Huge Agent in the chest.
The Agent goes down hard as Thor's momentum carries him past.
Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge Guard grabs his ankle in a last effort.
Thor looks back down at his foe, then drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into the fallen Agent's chest.
The Huge Agent grimaces in pain, defeated.
Thor races back towards the structure.
From outside, Thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of the structure.
He stands there -- soaking, bleeding, caked with wet earth.
His hammer rests just a few yards before him, energy surging around it.
Coulson steps into the structure through an access tunnel, one story up.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 68B.
As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface.
The crackling energy seems to reach out to him.
Coulson notices, his interest piqued.
Above the open ceiling of the structure, Barton's crane bucket comes into view.
Wind and rain whip around Barton as he stares into his rifle site, locked on the back of Thor's head -- his finger on the trigger.
Thor stands next to the hammer, feels its power.
He reaches out to it confidently.
Coulson watches from above.
Armed AGENTS approach behind him.
He motions for them to hold their positions, then radios Barton.
COULSON Barton...
Barton stands ready to take Thor down.
His finger starts to squeeze the trigger.
...hold your fire.
Barton releases the trigger, pulls up.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 69.
Coulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand around the hammer.
He smiles, triumphant, lifts...
but the hammer doesn't move.
Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail -- anger and frustration overtaking him.
He strains with all his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm and lightning above him.
Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing RUNES.
Thor looks down, sees them.
But, still, the hammer doesn't budge.
Thor falls to his knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing runes fade away.
He's failed.
Unworthy.
Coulson looks on, disappointed.
SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him.
Coulson activates his radio.
COULSON Ground units, move in.
COULSON Show's over.
COULSON As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or care.
COULSON He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the rain -- a man broken, lost.
COULSON From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment room.
COULSON We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive damage Thor's done to it during the melee.
Jane lowers her binoculars, sensing things have gone from bad to worse.
She steels herself, then starts over the ridge to help him.
Almost immediately, a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past her.
She hears the sound of DOGS and SHIELD AGENTS approaching, sees the glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her.
With no other choice, she makes a quick retreat.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 69A.
Heimdall stands at his post, watching the scene.
He lowers his head.
Jane stands with Selvig and Darcy in the empty lab.
Darcy picks up the book Selvig checked out of the library, looks through it.
JANE I can't just leave him there.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 70.
SELVIG Why not?
JANE You didn't see what happened.
JANE Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.
DARCY Hey!
DARCY Myeu-muh!
DARCY Jane looks at the illustration in the book, turns to Selvig knowingly.
Where did you find this?
Selvig grabs the book from them, quickly closes it.
SELVIG In the children's section.
SELVIG I wanted to show you how ridiculous his story was.
SELVIG Jane is unconvinced by this.
SELVIG She knows he wants to believe.
JANE Aren't you the one who's always told me to chase down all leads, all possibilities?
SELVIG I was talking about science, not magic!
JANE Magic's just science we don't understand yet.
JANE Arthur C. Clarke.
SELVIG Who wrote science fiction.
JANE The precursor of science fact.
SELVIG In some cases.
JANE If that's really an Einstein-Rosen Bridge out there, then there's something on the other side.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 70A.
JANE (CONT'D) Advanced beings could have come through it before.
SELVIG Jane...
DARCY A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities.
DARCY They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly insightful input.
DARCY Darcy shrugs.
DARCY Jane points at her, grateful for the support.
JANE Yes!
JANE Exactly!
JANE Thank you!
JANE Darcy beams.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 71.
SELVIG Jane, if you do this, you'll find yourself in a situation that I won't be able to get you out of this time.
DARCY I'll help you.
DARCY Jane looks grateful.
DARCY Selvig looks at her, sees there's no stopping her.
DARCY He sighs.
Thor sits in a chair, staring forward blankly, hands cuffed behind him.
Coulson stands across from him.
COULSON It's not easy to do what you did.
COULSON You made us all look like a bunch of mall cops.
COULSON That's hurtful.
The men you so easily subdued are highly-trained professionals, and in my experience, it takes someone who's received similar training to do what you did to them.
Would you like to tell me where you received your training?
Thor sits silently.
COULSON (CONT'D) Pakistan?
COULSON (CONT'D) Chechnya?
COULSON (CONT'D) Afghanistan?
COULSON (CONT'D) Then again, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type.
COULSON (CONT'D) What was it, South Africa?
COULSON (CONT'D) Still no answer.
COULSON (CONT'D) Coulson leans in close to him.
COULSON (CONT'D) Certain groups pay well for a good mercenary.
COULSON (CONT'D) Especially HYDRA.
COULSON (CONT'D) Coulson waits for a response, but gets none.
COULSON (CONT'D) Who are you?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 72.
THOR Just a man.
COULSON One way or another, we find out what we want to know.
COULSON We're good at that.
COULSON Coulson leaves the room.
COULSON Thor lowers his head.
LOKI I thought he'd never leave.
LOKI Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed in 21st century attire.
THOR Loki?
THOR What are you doing here?
LOKI I had to see you.
THOR What's happened?
THOR Tell me!
THOR Is it Jotunheim?
THOR Let me explain to
LOKI Father is dead.
LOKI Thor stares at him, stunned.
THOR What?
LOKI Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear.
LOKI The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's responsible for his father's fate.
LOKI Loki draws close to him, looks in his eyes, consolingly.
LOKI (CONT'D) You mustn't blame yourself.
LOKI (CONT'D) I know that you loved him.
LOKI (CONT'D) I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 73.
It was cruel to put the hammer within your reach, knowing you could never lift it.
Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss.
LOKI (CONT'D) The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.
THOR Can I come home?
LOKI The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.
THOR But couldn't we find a way to--
LOKI Mother has forbidden your return.
LOKI Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.
LOKI (CONT'D) This is goodbye, brother.
LOKI (CONT'D) I'm so sorry.
THOR No, I'm sorry.
THOR Loki...
THOR thank you for coming here.
LOKI Nothing could have stopped me.
LOKI Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.
LOKI (CONT'D) Fare well, brother.
THOR Good-bye.
COULSON Good-bye?
COULSON I just got back.
COULSON Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.
COULSON (CONT'D) Now.
COULSON (CONT'D) Where did we leave off?
Agents and Scientists work to repair the damaged area around Mjolnir.
They take no notice of Loki as he steps up beside the hammer.
He stares at it -- intrigued, wondering.
Can he do it?
He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't.
He lets it go, eyes it with contempt, then steps away.
He gestures with his arms.
An odd GREEN AND GOLD LIGHT rises from the ground, enveloping him, then he disappears.
Sitwell enters and speaks sotto to Coulson.
Sir...
he's got a visitor.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74.
Coulson and several other SHIELD AGENTS stand across from Erik Selvig.
COULSON "Donald Blake?"?
SELVIG Doctor Donald Blake.
SELVIG He's part of our team.
COULSON You have dangerous coworkers, Dr.
COULSON Selvig.
SELVIG Troubled, not dangerous.
SELVIG He was distraught when he found out that you'd taken all of our research.
SELVIG It was years of his life, gone!
SELVIG He got depressed, started drinking, and...
SELVIG well, you know the rest.
COULSON Uh-huh.
COULSON You mind if we take a moment to verify his identity?
SELVIG Certainly.
SELVIG The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.
SELVIG (CONT'D) You can understand how a man could go off like that.
SELVIG (CONT'D) I mean, a big, faceless organization like yours, coming in with their jack-booted thugs and stealing private property...
...is how he described it.
COULSON That doesn't explain how he managed to tear through our security.
COULSON Selvig shrugs.
SELVIG Steroids.
SELVIG He's a bit of a fitness nut.
SELVIG 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75.
SELVIG The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS."
SELVIG ? Coulson eyes the screen.
SELVIG After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.
COULSON It says here he's an M.D.
SELVIG He is.
SELVIG That is, he was.
SELVIG He switched careers and became a physicist.
SELVIG He's quite brilliant, really.
If you would just release him to me, I promise to keep an eye on him.
Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles.
He turns to an AGENT nearby.
COULSON Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig here.
COULSON The Techie looks to him, surprised.
Make sure he stays in town for the next few days in case we need to talk to him again.
Selvig shakes his hand.
SELVIG Thank you.
Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a seated Thor.
SELVIG Donny, Donny, Donny!
SELVIG There you are!
SELVIG Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on.
SELVIG Selvig pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.
SELVIG (CONT'D) It's going to be all right, my friend.
SELVIG (CONT'D) Come on, I'm taking you home.
As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp.
He spots Jane's hand- written journal among them.
As he passes, he quickly takes it from the pile and pockets it.
Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV record.
A security warning over the image clearly reads "SECURITY ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA."
? He knows it's been a ruse all along.
He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security Room, then follows them outside.
Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with Thor away from the base to the SUV.
Coulson calls to Selvig.
COULSON Just keep him away from the bars.
SELVIG I will!
Where are we going?
Selvig drops his cool demeanor.
SELVIG To get a drink.
SELVIG Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV.
SELVIG As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents -- GARRETT and CALE.
COULSON Follow them.
Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy surface of the planet.
Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling.
Loki enters.
Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides.
Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.
LAUFEY Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
LOKI I've come alone and unarmed.
LAUFEY To what end?
LOKI To make you another proposition.
So you're the one who let us into Asgard.
LOKI You're welcome.
LAUFEY My men are dead, and I have no Casket.
LAUFEY You are a deceiver.
LAUFEY Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki calmly stands his ground.
LOKI You have no idea what I am.
LOKI The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the guards stare in shock.
LOKI Loki grins.
LOKI (CONT'D) Hello, Father.
LOKI (CONT'D) Laufey releases him.
LOKI (CONT'D) Loki's body turns back to normal.
LOKI (CONT'D) Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76A.
LAUFEY Ah, the bastard son.
LAUFEY I thought Odin had killed you.
LAUFEY That's what I would have done.
LAUFEY He's as weak as you are.
LOKI No longer weak.
LOKI I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens.
LOKI Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me.
LOKI This gives Laufey pause.
LAUFEY Or perhaps it was the wisest choice I've ever made.
LAUFEY I will hear you.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 77.
LOKI I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies.
LOKI I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket.
LOKI Laufey studies Loki's face.
LAUFEY Why would you do this?
LOKI When all is done, we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds.
LOKI Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could.
LAUFEY This is a great day for Jotunheim.
LAUFEY Asgard is finally ours.
LOKI No.
LOKI Asgard is mine.
LOKI The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told.
LOKI Laufey considers the proposition.
LAUFEY I accept.
LAUFEY Loki turns to leave.
LAUFEY As he goes, the slightest trace of a smile crosses his face.
Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from his controls.
Heimdall glares at Loki.
Loki notices.
LOKI What troubles you, Gatekeeper?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78.
HEIMDALL I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see nor hear you.
HEIMDALL You were shrouded from me, like the Frost Giants who entered this Realm.
LOKI Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.
HEIMDALL Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see.
HEIMDALL Loki sizes him up, smiles.
LOKI You have great power, Heimdall.
LOKI Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?
HEIMDALL No.
LOKI And why is that?
HEIMDALL Because he is my King, and I am sworn to obey him.
LOKI Exactly.
LOKI Just as you're sworn to obey me now.
LOKI Yes?
LOKI A beat.
HEIMDALL Yes.
LOKI Good.
LOKI Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started.
LOKI Loki heads out of the Observatory.
LOKI Heimdall stares after him.
Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive.
The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots of whiskey.
Selvig pours the shot into his mug and downs it.
Thor follows his example.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 79.
SELVIG Seems Darcy's a terrible intern, but a talented hacker.
THOR Thank you for what you've done.
SELVIG Don't thank me.
SELVIG I only did it for Jane.
THOR Are you in love with her?
SELVIG Of course not!
SELVIG Jane's like a daughter to me.
SELVIG Her father and I taught at University together.
SELVIG A good man, but he never listened.
SELVIG This registers with Thor.
THOR Neither did I.
THOR Selvig eyes him with interest.
SELVIG I don't know if you're really delusional, and I really don't care at this point.
SELVIG I just care about her.
SELVIG I've seen the way she looks at you.
THOR I swear to you, I mean her no harm.
SELVIG Good.
SELVIG If that's the case, then I'll buy you one more drink, and you'll leave town tonight.
SELVIG A long pause, then Thor nods.
SELVIG He takes a drink.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80.
THOR I had it all backwards.
THOR I had it all wrong.
THOR Selvig watches him keenly.
THOR This is a different Thor than he's seen before.
SELVIG It's not a bad thing, finding out that you don't have all the answers.
SELVIG That's when you start asking the right questions.
SELVIG Thor takes this in.
THOR For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
SELVIG Anyone who's ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they don't know where the hell they are.
SELVIG Thor nods.
DRUNK TOWNIE Hey, I know you, man...
DRUNK TOWNIE An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor.
DRUNK TOWNIE He is one of the Townies from Isabela's Diner who saw Thor earlier.
DRUNK TOWNIE He approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight.
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D) You were in the diner with that hot girl.
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D) Thor doesn't like where this is going.
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D) I wouldn't mind her doing a little research on me.
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D) He laughs.
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D) Thor is annoyed.
THOR I have no quarrel with you.
THOR But she's a lady.
THOR You should be more respectful.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A.
DRUNK TOWNIE And you should shut the hell up, princess.
DRUNK TOWNIE Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it.
DRUNK TOWNIE But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's baiting.
THOR I will not fight him.
DRUNK TOWNIE Then it'll be easy to kick your ass.
DRUNK TOWNIE Selvig stands, steps between the two men.
SELVIG Gentlemen, please.
SELVIG Let's keep our heads.
SELVIG Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out.
SELVIG Thor's impressed.
SELVIG Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81.
Another drink?
Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN FOLK SONG.
They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically in time with the song.
"The mood is good, our hearts are full, there's magic in the air.
/ It's all because we're here tonight, and haven't got a care.
/ So raise a glass, and toast to life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la- la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed.
/ Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed!"? Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap.
Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a straight dead weight with a CLUNK.
WIDE SHOT.
Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell, Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to walk up the street towards Jane's trailer.
The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn with various books, old pizza boxes, etc.
A worried Jane lies on her bed, trying to read.
She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door.
She bolts to the door and opens it to find --
THOR Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder.
JANE Erik!
Is he all right?
THOR He's fine.
THOR Not injured at all.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81A.
As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway.
Selvig GROANS.
THOR (CONT'D) Sorry, my friend.
JANE What happened?
THOR We drank.
THOR We fought.
THOR He made his ancestors proud.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82.
JANE Put him on the bed.
JANE Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed.
JANE Selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.
SELVIG I still don't believe you're the God of Thunder.
But you ought to be.
Thor grins, pats him on the cheek.
As Selvig drifts off to sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him.
Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by Thor's tenderness.
Thor turns back to her, looks around.
THOR These are your chambers?
THOR Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious.
THOR She starts cleaning up the mess around her.
JANE Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really.
JANE I don't usually have visitors in here.
JANE Actually, never...
JANE Thor picks up a sock off the floor.
JANE She snatches it from him, puts it away.
JANE (CONT'D) Can we go outside?
Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors.
He offers Jane his hand, helps her up.
There's a telescope set up, a couple chairs, some blankets.
JANE I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep.
JANE Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data.
JANE Or when Darcy's driving me crazy.
I come up here a lot, now that I think about it.
Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82A.
JANE (CONT'D) I'm glad you're safe.
THOR You've been very kind.
THOR I've been far less grateful than you deserve.
JANE I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out.
JANE He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her
JANE (CONT'D) I don't believe it...
JANE (CONT'D) She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.
THOR It was all I could get back.
THOR Not as much as I promised.
THOR I'm sorry.
JANE No, this is good.
JANE Thank you.
JANE This means I don't have to start from scratch...
JANE She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a harsh realization clouding her face.
JANE Thor notices.
THOR What's wrong?
JANE SHIELD, whatever they are.
JANE They're never going to let this research see the light of day.
THOR You must do this.
THOR You must finish what you've started.
JANE Why?
THOR Because you're right.
THOR It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point.
THOR You're nearly there.
THOR You just need someone to show you how close you really are.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 83.
Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page which bears a sketch of the Bifrost.
He takes the pen from the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one point to another in space.
THOR (CONT'D) Look -- your ancestors called it magic.
THOR (CONT'D) You call it science.
THOR (CONT'D) I come from a place where they're one and the same thing.
THOR (CONT'D) We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.
JANE What is it?
THOR This is how my father explained it to me...
Your world is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree.
Now, you see it every day, without realizing.
Images glimpsed through -- what did you call it?...
...this Hubble Telescope.
So, Nine Realms...
They look at each other.
She nods.
They smile.
This is going to be a long night.
Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop.
He stares up at the night sky.
She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep.
He looks down at her, beautiful in the moonlight, looks out at the town beyond her.
Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD.
Sif stands nearby, ill at ease.
Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously as the large warrior stuffs himself.
Finally Fandral can stand it no more.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84.
FANDRAL Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, yet you manage to consume four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef, and two casks of ale.
FANDRAL Shame on you!
FANDRAL Don't you care?!
FANDRAL Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg pulls his weapon, stopping him.
VOLSTAGG Do not mistake my appetite for apathy.
SIF Stop it, both of you!
SIF We all know what we have to do, we're just too damned afraid to do it!
We must go.
We must find Thor.
Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the fire, carefully putting them into a POUCH at his side.
FANDRAL It's treason, Hogun.
VOLSTAGG To hell with treason, it's suicide.
Now, shh!
Heimdall may be watching!
It's said he can hear--
FANDRAL Yes, yes, we know!
SIF Thor would do the same for us.
SIF An EINHERJAR GUARD enters.
SIF They tense.
EINHERJAR GUARD Heimdall demands your presence.
EINHERJAR GUARD Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.
VOLSTAGG We're doomed.
Dawn breaks over the quiet town of Puente Antiguo.
Thor awakens, looks down to see Jane still sleeping, nuzzled against him.
She opens her eyes, looks up at him and smiles.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 85.
He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet.
Thor helps Jane down off a ladder.
A groggy, hungover Selvig emerges from Jane's trailer.
He sees Thor with Jane.
Selvig eyes the two of them together, then:
SELVIG I need some coffee.
SELVIG The three head inside Smith Motors.
SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a small audio surveillance device towards the lab.
Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee.
Thor holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate.
She scoops them out onto the plates.
Thor takes them over to the table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy.
DARCY Thanks.
THOR You're very welcome.
THOR Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates.
THOR She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their breakfast, looking like a little family.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86.
On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their wits.
Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window with binoculars.
Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link, turns to Cale.
AGENT GARRETT They want an update.
AGENT CALE Tell them he's eating eggs.
AGENT GARRETT Scrambled or fried?
AGENT GARRETT Cale glares at him.
Target is eating eggs, sir.
We'll keep you posted.
As the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his hand, gets an idea.
May I have this?
DARCY Sure.
THOR Thank you.
THOR Excuse me a moment.
THOR Thor leaves.
In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day.
(Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop tables.)
Isabela sweeps the front porch.
She looks up to see Thor approaching.
She eyes him suspiciously.
He offers her a MUG.
THOR To replace the one I broke.
THOR Please forgive my behavior.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86A.
She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.
ISABEL Okay.
ISABEL Thank you.
THOR If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your "coffee."
ISABEL Any time.
ISABEL He nods and walks away.
ISABEL She stares after him, smiling, and shrugs.
She could do worse.
Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's controls.
He glares at them accusingly.
VOLSTAGG Good Heimdall, less us explain--
HEIMDALL You would defy the commands of Loki our King, break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back?
HEIMDALL The four exchange nervous glances.
SIF Yes, but--
HEIMDALL Good.
HEIMDALL The group looks puzzled.
HEIMDALL What did he just say?
VOLSTAGG So you'll help us?
HEIMDALL I am bound by honor to our King.
HEIMDALL I cannot open the Bifrost to you.
HEIMDALL With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory.
HEIMDALL The others exchange puzzled looks.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86B.
FANDRAL Complicated fellow, isn't he?
VOLSTAGG Now what do we do?
VOLSTAGG Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.
SIF Look!
SIF The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the control panel.
SIF They exchange a grin.
SIF They have an ally.
SIF Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.
Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor.
COULSON What the hell was that?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 87.
TECHIE I don't know, sir.
TECHIE We got massive energy readings out of nowhere, then they just disappeared.
TECHIE Fifteen miles due northwest.
COULSON Let's go take a look.
Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert.
They clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the hole in the sky closing up behind it.
The Bifrost runes cover the desert sand around them.
VOLSTAGG He must have landed nearby.
VOLSTAGG It's time to put our tracking skills to work.
VOLSTAGG Spread out.
VOLSTAGG Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints.
FANDRAL The winds would have blown them away by now.
FANDRAL We should look for signs of a campfire.
SIF Or we could just start there.
SIF She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to Hogun, who has already started walking towards it.
SIF Volstagg and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.
FANDRAL It's worth a look, I suppose.
FANDRAL The party tromps towards the town.
Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor.
A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car.
He runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it.
Suddenly, the side of the CAR rises into the air.
The boy looks over, his mouth dropping open at what he sees.
Volstagg easily holds the car up with one hand.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 88.
Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car.
He hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair.
VOLSTAGG There you go, lad!
VOLSTAGG The boy just stares, standing frozen.
VOLSTAGG The Asgardians head off.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Is it just me, or does Earth look a little different to you?
SIF It has been a thousand years...
VOLSTAGG Things change so fast here.
VOLSTAGG You leave for a millennium, and it's like the whole neighborhood's gone.
VOLSTAGG Volstagg sniffs, smells something.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Perhaps we should split up.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 89.
Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking down the street.
AGENT GARRETT Is there a Renaissance Faire in town?
AGENT CALE Call it in.
AGENT CALE But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes their heads together.
AGENT CALE They're out.
VOLSTAGG Never cared for spies.
VOLSTAGG He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the ground.
VOLSTAGG Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a bite.
VOLSTAGG He likes what he tastes.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Exquisite.
Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath.
EINHERJAR GUARD My liege, the Warriors Three and the Lady Sif have gone missing.
EINHERJAR GUARD Loki reacts.
EINHERJAR GUARD He knows who's responsible.
Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.
HEIMDALL Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?
LOKI You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm?
LOKI There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind.
LOKI But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King.
And I say, for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper.
And you are no longer a citizen of Asgard.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90.
HEIMDALL Then I need no longer obey you.
HEIMDALL Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki.
HEIMDALL Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him.
HEIMDALL As it quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --
The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching.
From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose.
The fury of the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight towards Heimdall.
Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but still he moves forward.
Loki starts to get worried.
Heimdall is nearly upon him.
The Gatekeeper swings his massive sword at the prince.
But the blade STOPS, frozen, just inches from Loki's throat.
Loki breathes a sigh of relief and steps past him.
Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and opens the Bifrost.
He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it.
It turns its head toward its King.
LOKI Ensure my brother does not return.
Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates and utensils away.
The door opens.
VOLSTAGG Found you!
VOLSTAGG Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --
Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying dishes in mortal clothing.
Jane drops a plate.
It goes SHATTERING on the floor.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90A.
THOR My friends!
THOR Thor happily races over and greets his comrades.
THOR Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room.
THOR Jane looks concerned.
THOR Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder.
SELVIG I don't believe it...
DARCY Who are they?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 91.
VOLSTAGG Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.
VOLSTAGG Surely you've heard tales of Hogun the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and I, Volstagg the Svelte?
VOLSTAGG Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Well, perhaps I've put on a little more muscle since I was here last.
JANE That would have been a thousand years ago?
JANE Northern Europe?
VOLSTAGG Exactly!
VOLSTAGG Those lovely herring people.
VOLSTAGG They worshipped us!
VOLSTAGG Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.
THOR My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone.
THOR But you should not have come.
FANDRAL We're here to take you home.
FANDRAL Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.
THOR You know I can't.
THOR My father is dead because of me.
THOR I must remain in exile.
THOR The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.
SIF Thor...
SIF your father still lives.
SIF Thor reacts to the revelation.
A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site.
A few SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings.
Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes.
He turns to an Agent.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 92.
COULSON Get somebody from Linguistics out here.
COULSON Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost storm ROARS in the sky above.
COULSON Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in strength.
COULSON Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the desert floor.
COULSON Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.
Thor and the others see the Bifrost storm forming in the distance.
DARCY Was somebody else coming?
DARCY Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground.
From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at the Destroyer in awe.
We don't see it, just its shadow as it moves towards them.
Is that one of Stark's?
COULSON I don't think so.
COULSON But the guy doesn't tell me anything.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 93.
Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the Destroyer.
COULSON (CONT'D) Hello!
COULSON (CONT'D) You're using unregistered weapons technology.
COULSON (CONT'D) Please identify yourself.
COULSON (CONT'D) We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up inside.
COULSON (CONT'D) Incoming!
COULSON (CONT'D) As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle.
COULSON (CONT'D) SHIELD agents return fire.
Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in the distance.
Thor and the Asgardians prepare for battle, as Thor turns to Jane.
THOR Leave this town now.
THOR Get yourself and your friends to safety.
JANE What about you?
THOR I must stay and fight.
THOR The Asgardians look to Thor.
THOR (CONT'D) I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side.
VOLSTAGG You're but a mortal now.
VOLSTAGG You'll get yourself killed!
FANDRAL Or one of us, trying to protect you.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 94.
SIF The best thing you can do is get the mortals to safety and leave the battle to us.
SIF Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the oncoming threat.
You're right.
Sif looks surprised.
Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
THOR (CONT'D) Help me clear the streets.
THOR (CONT'D) I'll let none of these people die this day.
THOR (CONT'D) Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head across town, towards the Destroyer.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 95.
Laufey and two Frost Giants appear out of the Bifrost and step onto the platform.
Loki is waiting for them.
He pulls Gungnir from the Observatory's control panel.
The giant apparatus slows to a stop.
LOKI Father.
LOKI Welcome to Asgard.
The site looks like the aftermath of a war zone.
The smoldering wreckage of SHIELD vehicles lies strewn about.
Thor, Jane, and Selvig clear the streets, loading confused TOWNSFOLK into cars, moving others indoors.
A dog makes it way down the street, barking at something in front of it.
Then we see it --
Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from within it.
It unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96.
Sif and the Warriors Three head down the street towards the Destroyer.
SIF Keep him distracted.
SIF She hurries off.
SIF The Warriors Three continue towards the behemoth.
FANDRAL What do you think?
FANDRAL "The Svartalfheim Twist?"? "Kiss of the Hag?"? "Face Full of Boot?"? Volstagg grins eagerly.
VOLSTAGG "The Flying Mountain."
VOLSTAGG ? Hogun and Fandral groan.
FANDRAL Not "The Flying Mountain!"? It threw out my back for a year last time!
VOLSTAGG Trust me, it'll work.
Thor looks anxiously back down the street, where the Warriors Three get into position before the Destroyer.
My friends fight bravely, but they won't be able to hold it back much longer.
Darcy hurries out of the burning pet store carrying as many animals in cages as she can, then loads them into a truck.
Hogun and Fandral take off running towards the Destroyer, as Volstagg stands limbering up.
Come on!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96A.
Volstagg takes off running at full speed.
As he catches up to his comrades, Hogun and Fandral grab him on either side, and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the voluminous warrior into the air at the black metal behemoth.
VOLSTAGG For Asgaaaaard!!!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 97.
The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg SMASHES into the creature.
It looks like it might actually work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet.
It lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck.
He shrugs apologetically.
The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral, smashing into them, when --
SIF Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and plunges it deep into the back of the creature.
SIF The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its faceplate, Sif standing atop its back.
SIF The Asgardians have a brief moment of hope.
SIF But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once again.
SIF Sif looks on with growing trepidation.
SIF Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180 degrees to face its attackers.
SIF The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif.
SIF She barely dives off of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast.
SIF The Destroyer rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.
SIF Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying in all directions.
SIF Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks free, landing in the middle of the street.
Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction.
A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane, and Selvig off their feet.
Thor helps Jane to her feet, when they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris, impaled by a twisted piece of iron.
JANE Erik!
JANE She and Thor hurry to his side.
JANE He's losing blood, going into shock.
Go!
Leave me!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98.
Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing stones lying in the middle of the street.
He makes a break for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the pouch and races back.
He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and useless.
He pours the contents out in his hand.
THOR Come on...
THOR give me one!
THOR Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still intact.
THOR Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over the end of the iron rod.
JANE What are you doing?
JANE What is that?
JANE As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it.
JANE Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it reaches Selvig's wound.
JANE The powder heals his wound completely.
JANE Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment.
JANE He reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed flesh.
SELVIG I'm really starting to like him.
SELVIG Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.
Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on the ground.
He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.
THOR Go, while you can!
SIF But the others...
THOR You can't help them now.
THOR Your job is to survive.
THOR She struggles to sit up.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98A.
SIF No!
SIF I will die a warrior's death.
SIF Stories will be told of this day-- He gently takes her shield from her.
THOR Live and tell those stories yourself.
THOR At last, she nods.
THOR Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious, with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby.
THOR Thor makes his way towards them.
THOR Volstagg is barely breathing.
THOR Thor tries to pull him to safety, but it's no use.
THOR He won't budge.
THOR He rouses Hogun and Fandral.
Get him out of here!
FANDRAL No.
FANDRAL We can still fight!
THOR But not win.
THOR Move Volstagg, or he'll die!
THOR Thor looks at them, grins.
THOR (CONT'D) Don't worry, my friends.
THOR (CONT'D) I have a plan.
THOR (CONT'D) The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and drag him away from the battlefield.
THOR (CONT'D) After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then tosses Sif's shield aside.
THOR (CONT'D) He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely defenseless.
THOR (CONT'D) Brother...
THOR (CONT'D) for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry.
THOR (CONT'D) But these people have done nothing to you.
THOR (CONT'D) They are innocents.
THOR (CONT'D) He continues towards the Destroyer.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98B.
THOR (CONT'D) Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 99.
Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms.
The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then swats him with its enormous arm.
We hear the sickening CRACK of breaking bones as Thor goes flying.
Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street, a look of horror on their faces.
Jane tries to rush out to Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.
SELVIG Jane, no!
SELVIG He pulls her into Smith Motors.
SELVIG A RAVEN flies overhead, watching the scene --
Odin lies in the Odinsleep.
A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 100.
Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips.
The Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards him.
It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to unleash its fiery blast.
Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear, burning bright.
Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the hammer's surface.
SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead.
They look up.
Clouds form in the sky above.
Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies straight up into the air like a rocket.
The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --
A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding with the Destroyer's blast.
The explosion is massive.
The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust enveloping the street.
As the smoke clears we see --
JANE Oh.
JANE My.
JANE God.
Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand -- the God of Thunder once more.
Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir down onto the ground.
Lightning strikes the Destroyer.
It convulses.
Thor swings Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder God.
Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale force winds.
Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky.
The Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101.
It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate, locks it in place, unleashes its blast.
Thor dives downwards straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.
Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast, overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the Destroyer.
Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.
The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES within him, firing out of all his openings.
Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.
Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its lifeless carcass.
As he does, the other objects and debris pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.
Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him.
A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.
COULSON Donald...
COULSON I don't think you've been completely honest with me.
Thor, Jane, Darcy, Selvig and the other Asgardians stand in the desert with Thor, Coulson, and several SHIELD AGENTS.
Darcy turns to Volstagg.
DARCY So, how can you speak our language?
VOLSTAGG Your language?
VOLSTAGG Ha!
VOLSTAGG Silly girl, you're speaking ours.
VOLSTAGG Thor calls up to the sky.
THOR Heimdall!
THOR Open the Bifrost!
Heimdall stands frozen.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102.
Thor looks to the others with concern.
THOR He would open it if he could.
THOR I fear the worst.
VOLSTAGG Then we're trapped here forever.
FANDRAL Then I suppose we'd best start settling into our new lives.
FANDRAL He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Are all earth maidens as fair as you?
FANDRAL (CONT'D) Darcy enjoys the attention.
DARCY No.
DARCY Thor shouts back up to the sky.
THOR Heimdall!
From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him.
Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters all his strength.
The ice around him begins to CRACK.
With a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice.
Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the Observatory.
The Asgardians begin to lose hope.
Volstagg eyes a SHIELD Agent's machine gun.
VOLSTAGG Primitive.
VOLSTAGG Good enough for hunting small game, I suppose.
VOLSTAGG Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky.
VOLSTAGG Thor grins.
VOLSTAGG The mortals look on, amazed.
VOLSTAGG Fandral turns to Darcy.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102A.
FANDRAL Sorry, my love.
FANDRAL These things happen.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 103.
He joins the other Asgardians at their side.
Thor turns to Coulson.
THOR Know this, son of Coul.
THOR You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world.
THOR From this day forward, count me as your ally.
If you return the items you have stolen from Jane Foster.
COULSON Not stolen.
COULSON Borrowed.
COULSON Jane shoots him a look.
COULSON Coulson quickly continues.
COULSON (CONT'D) You'll get your equipment back.
COULSON (CONT'D) You're going to need it to continue your research...
COULSON (CONT'D) which, after today's events, SHIELD would like to fully sponsor.
COULSON (CONT'D) If that's all right with you.
COULSON (CONT'D) Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly.
COULSON (CONT'D) She looks at him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him again.
THOR Whatever fate lies before me, you are part of it.
THOR He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately.
THOR Thor and the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.
The Asgardians emerge from the Bifrost to find Heimdall slumped over his controls.
THOR Get him to the healing room!
THOR Leave my brother to me.
Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside.
She hears the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle.
Frigga grabs a sword.
A Frost Giant bursts in.
She swings the sword around hard, cleaving into his shoulder.
He swats her aside angrily.
Laufey and the Brute Frost Giant enter.
Laufey looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed.
Thor rides the winds over the Bridge, speeding towards the palace.
The Jotun king stands over the unconscious Odin, relishing the moment.
He forms an ICE BLADE.
Thor races through the entrance to the palace.
Laufey stands before the sleeping Odin.
LAUFEY It's said you can still see and hear what transpires around you, even in this state.
LAUFEY I hope it's true, so that you may know your death came by the hand of Laufey.
LAUFEY He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --
Hits him from behind.
As the Jotun king falls to the ground, we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding Gungnir.
LOKI And your death came by the son of Odin.
LOKI 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 105.
LOKI The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly, his eyes going wide.
LOKI The Brute falls to the ground,
FRIGGA Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back.
FRIGGA She looks to Loki, takes him in her arms.
LOKI (CONT'D) I swear to you, mother, they will pay for what they've done today.
LOKI (CONT'D) I will end the Jotun threat, now and forever!
LOKI (CONT'D) He looks to Odin.
LOKI (CONT'D) And I will make you proud.
LOKI (CONT'D) Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts in.
LOKI (CONT'D) He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and respect.
LOKI (CONT'D) Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.
FRIGGA Thor!
FRIGGA She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed on his brother.
FRIGGA Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.
LOKI Found its way back to you, did it?
THOR No thanks to you.
THOR Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.
FRIGGA What?
THOR Why don't you tell her?
THOR How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends?
THOR To kill me?
THOR Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.
LOKI It must have been enforcing Father's last command.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106.
THOR You're a talented liar, brother.
THOR Always have been.
It's good to have you back.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to destroy Jotunheim.
Loki suddenly raises Gungnir, FIRES it point-blank at Thor.
Thor goes flying backwards, SMASHING through the chamber walls, into...
Thor flies from the blast through ANOTHER wall on the opposite side of the corridor, to...
Thor plummets from the palace and CRASHES into the reflecting pools below.
Loki speeds on horseback down the Rainbow Bridge, then quickly dismounts and enters the Observatory.
Loki operates the Observatory's controls.
The massive turret spins, points.
Thor awakens to the sound of the Bifrost.
He stands, sees the Observatory firing the Bifrost energy into space.
He looks to where the Bifrost is aimed.
THOR Jotunheim...
Thor soars on the winds above the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost energy roaring through Bridge, feeding into the Observatory.
He lands before the Observatory's huge doorway.
Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of the Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106A.
He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an enormous block of ice.
Loki stands atop it.
LOKI All these years, and no one's ever dared to use it as a weapon.
LOKI Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through it to get to the controls frozen within.
LOKI Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir.
LOKI The blast hits the ice in front of Thor, blasting him back across the floor.
LOKI Loki steps down from the ice as Thor staggers to his feet.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107.
LOKI (CONT'D) You can't stop it.
LOKI (CONT'D) The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.
THOR Why have you done this?
LOKI To do what Father never could.
LOKI To destroy their kind forever.
LOKI When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done.
THOR He won't!
THOR You can't kill an entire race!
LOKI What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants?
LOKI You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands.
THOR I've changed.
LOKI So have I.
LOKI Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.
LOKI (CONT'D) Fight me.
LOKI (CONT'D) He swings Gungnir at Thor again.
LOKI (CONT'D) Thor catches it in his hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow, but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back towards the frozen controls.
LOKI (CONT'D) Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which immobilizes Thor in the air.
LOKI (CONT'D) He hangs there, suspended.
THOR Is the throne really worth what you've done?
THOR What you would become?
LOKI I never wanted the throne.
LOKI I only wanted to be your equal.
LOKI Now fight me!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108.
With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground.
Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.
THOR I will not fight you, brother.
LOKI I am not your brother.
LOKI I never was.
THOR Loki, this is madness...
THOR Loki grins.
LOKI Is it?
LOKI He FIRES Gungnir at Thor.
LOKI Thor dodges the blast, rolls to his feet.
LOKI (CONT'D) What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft?
LOKI (CONT'D) Don't tell me it was a woman.
LOKI (CONT'D) Thor doesn't answer.
LOKI (CONT'D) Loki laughs, realizing he's right.
LOKI (CONT'D) It was.
LOKI (CONT'D) Perhaps when we're finished here I'll pay her a little visit myself.
LOKI (CONT'D) That did it.
LOKI (CONT'D) Loki and Thor rush at each other.
LOKI (CONT'D) They and their weapons collide.
LOKI (CONT'D) The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.
It's mayhem.
The growing Bifrost TEARS through the ice of the planet like a destructive wave, breaking it apart.
JOTUNS go running in terror, others fall through the breaking ice.
Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up around it.
SELVIG Jane?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108A.
JANE Something's wrong.
Thor and Loki battle savagely.
Loki fires Gungnir, sending Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his hand.
The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.
Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too powerful.
Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides towards the Bifrost.
LOKI If you care so much for the Jotuns, then die with them.
LOKI The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to drag him away.
LOKI He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he concentrates, mustering his will.
LOKI He reaches out his hand towards the Bifrost.
LOKI MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.
LOKI The hammer pulls him free.
LOKI Loki tries to fire off another blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his brother.
Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge.
As Thor gets to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.
LOKI Thor!
LOKI Help me!
LOKI Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking up at him desperately.
LOKI (CONT'D) Please...
LOKI (CONT'D) Loki's fingers start to slip.
LOKI (CONT'D) Thor reaches down to grab his brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's.
LOKI (CONT'D) Just then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him.
LOKI (CONT'D) Thor whirls around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.
LOKI (CONT'D) Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls him across the bridge.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 110.
Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees.
Loki strides up behind him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.
It passes through him.
Instantly, another Loki appears next to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.
Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one, never making contact.
Thor falls back to his knees.
The Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.
I was always more clever than you.
THOR Yet still not clever enough.
THOR With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air, summoning lightning.
THOR A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the Lokis.
THOR All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir knocked from his grasp.
THOR Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his back.
THOR Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps away.
THOR Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't.
THOR He looks confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest.
THOR Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off.
THOR He's pinned to the ground.
THOR Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the Bridge.
THOR He's at a loss of what to do.
THOR Loki watches him smugly.
LOKI Look at you, the Mighty Thor.
LOKI With all your strength, what good does it do you now?
LOKI Thor knows Loki's right.
LOKI He's powerless to stop what's happening.
LOKI He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet, VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy feeding into the Observatory.
LOKI Then he gets an idea.
LOKI He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.
LOKI Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir.
LOKI The hammer goes flying to his grasp.
LOKI Loki looks confused.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111.
Thor raises Mjolnir in the air.
Clouds form above him, thunder RUMBLING.
Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he channels the power of the storm into it, then -- He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge.
The blow is massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking the Observatory itself like an earthquake.
A crack appears where the blow struck.
Loki rises to his feet.
LOKI (CONT'D) Stop!
LOKI (CONT'D) What are you doing?!
LOKI (CONT'D) Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder.
LOKI (CONT'D) BOOM!
LOKI (CONT'D) The crack grows bigger.
LOKI (CONT'D) The Bifrost energy starts to stream out from it.
LOKI (CONT'D) Loki thinks fast.
LOKI (CONT'D) If you destroy the Bridge, you'll never see her again!
LOKI (CONT'D) Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor through the back.
THOR Forgive me.
THOR Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow -- KRAKABOOM!
THOR The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING out of it.
THOR Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of the blast.
THOR A wave of destruction moves forward along the Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.
THOR The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.
THOR As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other.
THOR They both fall towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the broken Bridge.
THOR They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized by the debris, when --
Catches Thor's leg.
Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir as Loki hangs onto the other end.
Loki looks up, shocked to
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 112.
ODIN ALLFATHER Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.
ODIN ALLFATHER Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is disappointment and regret.
ODIN ALLFATHER Loki lets go.
THOR (CONT'D) No!
THOR (CONT'D) But it's too late.
THOR (CONT'D) Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy.
THOR (CONT'D) It carries him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the Observatory, disappearing out of sight.
THOR (CONT'D) Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge.
THOR (CONT'D) Drained, Thor falls back into his father's arms.
ODIN It is over.
The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing in all directions.
Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught.
She knows the significance of what's just happened.
JANE It's gone.
A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three sit amongst the gathered Asgardians.
Hogun sits between Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting their battle with the Destroyer.
VOLSTAGG ...and then, with a mighty bellow, I flew at the great metal beast and laid it low...
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113.
FANDRAL Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a--
VOLSTAGG As a matter of fact, falling down was a tactic.
VOLSTAGG Lulling the Destroyer into a false sense of security!
FANDRAL Well, I was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield.
FANDRAL That makes me the real hero.
FANDRAL Doesn't it, Hogun?
FANDRAL Hogun points to Volstagg.
HOGUN Big stomach.
HOGUN Big mouth.
HOGUN The other gathered Asgardians laugh.
HOGUN Volstagg and Fandral look to Hogun.
HOGUN The grim warrior gives just a trace of a smile.
FANDRAL Well, how about that?
FANDRAL A smile!
FANDRAL I'd say that calls for another drink!
FANDRAL They laugh and raise another round.
FANDRAL Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the sadness she struggles to conceal.
FANDRAL Sif notices, approaches Frigga, bows her head.
SIF My Queen.
SIF I am so sorry for your loss.
SIF Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.
FRIGGA Thank you, Sif.
FRIGGA She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around him.
FRIGGA (CONT'D) How is he?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.
SIF He mourns for his brother.
SIF And he misses her.
SIF The mortal.
SIF Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at Thor with new feelings.
SIF He rises and leaves the hall.
FRIGGA He will need his friends now more than ever.
SIF I will always be at his side.
SIF Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.
Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought.
Odin walks up behind him.
ODIN You'll be a wise King.
THOR There will never be a wiser king than you.
THOR Or a better father.
I have much to learn.
I know that now.
But some day, perhaps, I will make you proud.
ODIN You've already made me proud.
ODIN Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.
Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost energy, drifting off into space.
Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.
Thor stares out at the stellar void.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 114.
THOR Can you see her?
THOR Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.
HEIMDALL Yes.
THOR How is she?
Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board.
As we pull away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly inspired by the illustration.
We pull further back to see that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research facility, abuzz with activity.
SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of- the-art equipment.
Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the SCIENTISTS.
We continue to track right outside the glass windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at hand, as always.
She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE before her, which bears the "STARK INDUSTRIES"? logo.
From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.
DARCY Here you go.
JANE Thanks.
JANE Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.
DARCY He would have come back if he could.
JANE I know.
JANE But if he can't get here on his own...
JANE Jane hits a switch on the device.
JANE Suddenly, a 3-D HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device, bathing the two women in its glow.
JANE We recognize what it is -- YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.
JANE (CONT'D) ...maybe we can help him find his way back.
