Annie Mumolo
Annie is in nice lingerie, happily getting ready for the day.
She puts a lot of effort into her appearance.
Products everywhere, too many hair-flips, eye-cream, no hair out of place.
She walks into the bedroom, where TED, a gorgeous man sleeps.
She sneaks back into the bed, carefully positioning herself and moving the sheets to show her good parts.
She coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up then pretend sleeps.
TED Good morning.
TED Annie pretends to wake up.
Wow, you look beautiful.
What?
No.
I don't.
Oh my God its the morning.
I look terrible.
I just woke up.
TED Last night was fun.
ANNIE Yeah, I had the best time.
ANNIE I have't had that much fun on a first date in years, ever...
ANNIE She brushes the hair off his forehead as if he were her long time lover.
TED So listen Annie, I like you.
TED So, I want to be up front with you.
TED I'm not really looking for a relationship right now.
TED Annie's eyes grow large.
TED She uncomfortably smiles at him, nodding.
ANNIE Oooooo.
ANNIE Oops.
ANNIE I mean, yeah.
ANNIE What?
TED I just want to be honest right off the bat.
ANNIE Yeah, yeah.
ANNIE Ok.
ANNIE Yeah.
ANNIE Yeah.
ANNIE I love that.
ANNIE Annie struggles to maintain her composure.
TED I'm just so busy and I don't have time for another person...I...
ANNIE Yeah, me too, I'm soo busy--
TED And summer's coming--
ANNIE Yeah, summer, exactly.
ANNIE It's a crazy season.
ANNIE So you just wanna give me a call in the fall or--?
TED Yeah, I'm not gonna be in town much even in the fall--
ANNIE You shouldn't be!
ANNIE Yeah, Halloween--
TED I'm gonna be travelling a lot for work.
ANNIE Me too, I'm just- so many business trips to places that are just far awaya??cause I'm doing really well at work.
TED And honestly, (sits up) I don't even know how I feel about the whole monogamy thing, is one person really enough for anyone?
TED I mean, I like to be with a lot of different people.
ANNIE It is sooo refreshing to hear you say that, because isn't that what everyone thinks but is afraid to say?
ANNIE I mean, i's science.
ANNIE I'm-I don't want a relationship either.
ANNIE Let's just say that.
ANNIE And I wouldn't even care whatever you do or I do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like no strings attached at all.
ANNIE I'm just different from other girls.
TED Yeah.
TED Well anyway, I really should get going.
TED I was gonna get a haircut today.
ANNIE Yeah, they say that every couple months it's good to trim the ends, you know, get all the dead stuff.
ANNIE So, cool.
ANNIE Cool.
ANNIE 've cut hair before.
ANNIE He waits, but Annie doesn't budge.
TED Well, like I said I got stuff to do.
TED Annie notices a picture of a sailboat above the bed.
ANNIE Yeah, me too.
ANNIE Gonna try to get some sailing in before the weather gets crazy...
Cool, well I don't wanna be Get up the jib..
late.
Ted gets up.
Awkward moment leading into...
TED Oh, and thanks for the lemon bars.
ANNIE Oh, no problem.
ANNIE Made from scratch.
Annie stands at the closed driveway gate waiting as Ted repeatedly presses the button.
She smiles at a neighbor.
TED Sometimes it sticks!
ANNIE No, I love it!
ANNIE The gate starts to open.
ANNIE Annie exits.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Byyyyee!
Annie sits in her old shitty car.
She lets out an exasperated sigh, then sees the clock.
ANNIE Oh, shit.
ANNIE The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away.
Annie gets out her phone and speed dials LILLIAN.
Lillian is getting dressed.
Upscale, professional clothes.
LILLIAN It's summer?!
LILLIAN What the hell does that mean?
LILLIAN He can't date anyone in the summer?
ANNIE I guess?
ANNIE I don't know.
ANNIE I feel so stupid now.
LILLIAN No he's stupid Ann, not you.
ANNIE I think I might be a little bit stupid.
LILLIAN Ew.
LILLIAN Did you have sex with him?
ANNIE No!
ANNIE But I gave him a blow job.
LILLIAN What?!
ANNIE Well, he kept putting it in my face.
ANNIE Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a Luna Bar in his sweats.
ANNIE He's stretching and flexing his muscles trying to make her laugh.
LILLIAN Well, at least he was honest with you so you don't waste your time with him.
DOUGIE Baby, look how hard I worked out.
DOUGIE Look at all this sweat.
LILLIAN Can you see that I'm on the phone?
LILLIAN I'm talking to Annie.
DOUGIE Hey Annie.
LILLIAN Are you eating my Luna Bar?
LILLIAN Those are for women you know?
DOUGIE Shit.
DOUGIE Really?!
LILLIAN It's not gonna do anything to you.
DOUGIE Oh my God.
DOUGIE My breasts are getting bigger.
DOUGIE He tries to rub up against Lillian.
LILLIAN Ew, go take a shower.
LILLIAN Dougie leaves.
DOUGIE I'm gonna play with my new boobs in there.
LILLIAN I swear I cannot handle him right now.
LILLIAN He has been driving me crazy.
LILLIAN Sometimes it feels like I'm kissing my brother.
LILLIAN I don't know what do.
LILLIAN Annie pulls into an alleyway behind HARRINGTO'S JEWELRY STORE and starts changing into her work uniform in the car.
LILLIAN A white blouse and navy skirt.
ANNIE At least you have someone.
ANNIE God, wha's wrong with me?
LILLIAN There's nothing wrong with you.
LILLIAN But I think maybe, and don't get mad at me, I've said this to you before, you need to stop trying so hard.
ANNIE I still don't think I do that.
LILLIAN OK, so you had a first date last night.
LILLIAN Did you bring him a present?
LILLIAN Annie is silent.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Ann, what did I tell you?
ANNIE I brought him lemon-bars because I was making them anyway, as a friend.
ANNIE Yo're right, that's weird.
DOUGIE Shit!
LILLIAN What?!
I just chipped a nail!
LILLIAN Ok, I don't know if it's because I'm tired or what, but I wanna kill him.
ANNIE Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the mirror and remember when I was getting my braces off and farted at the orthodontist.
ANNIE Lillian laughs.
LILLIAN Oh my God.
LILLIAN We need to hang out.
LILLIAN 'm coming to Milwaukee this weekend.
ANNIE Are you serious?
LILLIAN We'll go to Joni's and pig out and I'll bring some shitty magazines, and I'm gonna spend the night.
ANNIE God, I haven't seen you in months!
LILLIAN I'll call you tomorrow.
LILLIAN Bye.
LILLIAN They hang up.
LILLIAN Dougie is in the doorway wearing her nightie stretched over his body.
DOUGIE Baby, I'm going through some changes...
LILLIAN (laughing) You're an idiot.
LILLIAN We see she gets a kick out of him.
INT. HARRINGTON'S JEWELRY STORE. Annie enters hurriedly pulling her hair into a bun.
ANNIE Hi.
ANNIE Sorry, sorry!
ANNIE I'm here.
ANNIE I'm here.
DONNA (quickly) Annie!
DONNA Thank God.
DONNA OK people!
DONNA Gather around me please, in a tight semicircle.
DONNA Annie and six other employees gather around DONNA.
DONNA (CONT'D) (slightly overdramatic) Something terrible has happened.
DONNA (CONT'D) Donald will not be coming in to work today.
DONNA (CONT'D) He stepped on a wasp and there is some uncomfortable swelling.
DONNA (CONT'D) Employees mumble.
DONNA (CONT'D) Annie?
DONNA (CONT'D) Where's your tie?
DONNA (CONT'D) Everyone looks at Annie.
DONNA (CONT'D) She holds it up and starts to put it on.
DONNA (CONT'D) Now, I have an eye doctor's appointment that I can't change or they'll will charge me.
DONNA (CONT'D) So someone will have to cover for Donald in engagement rings.
DONNA (CONT'D) Now I-- Annie and SANDY, a male co-worker, shoot their hands the air eagerly.
DONNA (CONT'D) Sandy?
DONNA (CONT'D) Today's your day.
SANDY Ooh, my horoscope said I would be presented with an opportunity at work today.
SANDY That is eerie.
SANDY That is eerie.
DONNA Annie, that means you'll be alone in keepsakes.
DONNA You think you can handle it?
Yeah, look out.
There might be a bum- rush for letter openers...
The employees snicker.
ANNIE Sometimes there is, so....there have been.
ANNIE At times, there has been.
DONNA Alright everybody, let's get to work!
DONNA Saneel?!...OPEN SESAME!
DONNA SANEEL, the security guard, rolls his eyes and unlocks the doors.
DONNA Everyone goes to work.
DONNA Donna gathers her things and starts walking towards the exit with Annie tailing behind her.
ANNIE Donna, can I talk to you for a second?
ANNIE I feel like if you gave me a shot at engagement rings sometime, I could really-
DONNA Annie, what is the calibration of a 2 carat diamond in a standard English setting?
ANNIE Five?
DONNA I just made all of that up.
DONNA None of that was real.
DONNA I just put words together.
DONNA You're not ready for the big leagues.
DONNA Understand?
ANNIE It's so hard to make commission over there.
DONNA Sweetheart...did I ever tell you the story of the little paralyzed Chinese girl who wanted to be dancer?
ANNIE Many times.
DONNA She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling in her legs, and then one day after years of believing in herself, she stood up out of that chair and tap-danced for the king.
DONNA On his birthday!
DONNA My point is, Sandy makes a real effort around here.
DONNA He connects with the customer.
DONNA And when he wants to make a sale, he goes for it.
ANNIE Okay.
ANNIE (beat) I do want it.
DONNA (smiling) Good.
DONNA Showing up on time is a wonderful place to start.
DONNA Donna talks to herself and gathers her things.
DONNA (CONT'D) Uhh!
DONNA (CONT'D) A wasp!
DONNA (CONT'D) Who walks around even their own backyard without at least a thin sandal.
DONNA (CONT'D) It's reckless!
DONNA (CONT'D) Donna exits.
DONNA (CONT'D) A customer passes Anni's section.
ANNIE Hello, can I interest you in a sterling silver money clip that will create memories for you and your family?
ANNIE No?
ANNIE We cut to a HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOW on T.V.
When Dave and Rhonda bought this house, it was a medical clinic.
I've never seen so many cupboards!
STEVE, Annie's mid-thirties roommate, sits on the couch shirtless and is enthralled by the show.
STEVE Noooo.
STEVE That's, that's sooo smart.
STEVE Annie enters the apartment, tired.
STEVE She throws her keys down and sifts through her mail.
STEVE Steve presses mute.
STEVE (CONT'D) There you are, you stayer-out-all- nighter.
STEVE (CONT'D) Did you make out?
STEVE (CONT'D) Sleep over?
STEVE (CONT'D) As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks towards her room.
STEVE (CONT'D) Don't go in the bathroom.
STEVE (CONT'D) Are you going to bed?
ANNIE Yes.
ANNIE I'm beat.
STEVE Your ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did what you said and just threw it away.
ANNIE Thanks.
ANNIE Goodnight Steve!
ANNIE She shuts the door behind her.
STEVE That credit lady called!
STEVE She wants to talk to you, Annie!
STEVE She's gonna find you.
STEVE Steve sits back on the couch, un-mutes the T.V..
This is where they bagged the animals that didn't make it through the testing.
We turned it into a cozy Moroccan reading room.
STEVE Gross/Amazing.
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM. She sits on her bed grabs a a??Sounds to Relaxa?? CD with a post-it that reads, a??Love, Moma??.
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM. She plays it and lies down.
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM. We hear a loud Tibetan woma's voice wailing.
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM. NOT relaxing.
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM. She turns it off and curls up on top of her bed.
Annie and Lillian read magazines.
ANNIE You're right.
ANNIE God, she's getting really skinny.
LILLIAN Ann.
ANNIE What?
LILLIAN (quietly) Your boyfriend just walked in.
LILLIAN REVEAL: An orange-skinned BODY BUILDER with HUGE arms and legs in a tiny muscle tank and shorts.
ANNIE Oh my God!
ANNIE Look, he showed up with your mom.
ANNIE It's a short grey-haired OUTDOORSEY WOMAN in hiking boots.
ANNIE They laugh to themselves.
ANNIE Annie keeps reading.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Cool!
ANNIE (CONT'D) They're making a WKRP movie.
LILLIAN Here Annie, let me turn the page for you.
ANNIE What?
ANNIE Lillian splays her hand over the magazine showing off a sparkling DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.
LILLIAN (playfully) I just want to help you turn the page of your magazine for you...
ANNIE Lillian!
ANNIE What is that?!
LILLIAN I'm engaged.
ANNIE What?!!
LILLIAN He proposed at dinner last night.
LILLIAN I wanted to tell you in person and show you this rock!
ANNIE It's beautiful.
ANNIE Lillian.
ANNIE Oh my God, this is...this is crazy!
LILLIAN I know Dougie and I have been fighting a lot, but I've been so stressed out with
ANNIE That's not I mean.
ANNIE I mean, I remember when we met him at Lake Mills.
ANNIE You lost your virginity to him right in front of me on the dock, remember?
LILLIAN Oh you want to get into who's done what down at the lake?
ANNIE No, I don't.
ANNIE It's just making me realize how long we've known each other.
LILLIAN Well then, who better to be my Maid of Honor?
ANNIE Oh my God!
ANNIE I don't know what to say!
LILLIAN Annie, you're my best friend.
LILLIAN Honestly I didn't even have to think about it.
ANNIE Uh, wow.
ANNIE Yes!
ANNIE Of course!
ANNIE Yes!
ANNIE My God.
ANNIE I've never been in a wedding.
LILLIAN It's no big deal, and I don't want to make it one.
LILLIAN It's not gonna be a big crazy thing.
LILLIAN I wanna keep it simple.
LILLIAN (beat) What dessert are you gonna get?
ANNIE I know what you're doing.
ANNIE Don't downplay this.
ANNIE I'm happy for you.
ANNIE And someday when hell freezes over and I get married, you can be my Maid of Honor.
ANNIE But for right now, this is about you.
ANNIE OK?
ANNIE This is you're day, and it is a big deal.
LILLIAN Ok, but I still don't want this to be a huge production.
LILLIAN I just want to have all my friends meet each other, have fun, dance, drink, whatever.
ANNIE Then that's what it'll be.
ANNIE Did you guys set a date?
LILLIAN Oh God, not yet.
LILLIAN I don't want a super long engagement, but there's a lot to do.
ANNIE Well you are very fortunate because you happen have the best maid of honor in the whole wide world, and-- Lillian's cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles.
LILLIAN (mocking) Can you hold that thought.
LILLIAN I's my fiancee calling.
LILLIAN Lillian gets up laughing.
LILLIAN Annie laughs along with her.
ANNIE Ooo, haha...
ANNIE Annie continues laughing alone.
ANNIE She looks around the room as her smile disappears.
ANNIE She remembers...
Annie and Lillian at 7 years old standing outside eating popsicles, smiling.
Lillian Marie Donovan.
Do you take your husband, forever, to be your husband?
Lillian stands by a poster of Eric Estrada in his C.H.I.P.s uniform that is taped to a tree.
I do.
Do you Annie Lucille Walker, take your husband, forever?
Reveal Annie standing next to a poster of John Baker from Chips.
ANNIE I do.
LILLIAN And now we will leave on our honeymoon to...
The girls rip the posters off of the trees.
An old station wagon sits in the dirt driveway.
They get in the back seat, look straight ahead and just sit there.
'S thought.
LILLIAN The madness has begun.
LILLIAN Dougie's parents are having an engagement party for us next Friday.
ANNIE Awesome!...
Annie, in her jogging clothes, reaches for a wedding magazine, but a woman's magazine catches her eye.

ANNIE (looking around) Ooh, what's this...
ANNIE She finds the article.
ANNIE a??Hurry, before he gets away!

ANNIE (CONT'D) Some girls are ugly.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I know a lot of ugly girls.

ANNIE (CONT'D) I've seen a lot of ugly dogs too.
ANNIE (CONT'D) But some people I know who are considered dogs, you know, they have a good personality, and are better looking to people cuz of that.
ANNIE (CONT'D) And people who are not nice...that's ugly to me.
ANNIE (CONT'D) And female dogs are called bitches, that's weird.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I'm just kidding.
ANNIE (CONT'D) It's a joke.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I have better ones.
ANNIE (CONT'D) The guy leaves.

ANNIE He probably didn't see you, Mom.
Annie's mom, JUDY, (50's) is on the phone while painting a very lifelike portrait of Wynona Judd from a photograph that's pinned to it's corner.
JUDY Oh, he saw me alright.
JUDY He was married to me for fourteen years, he knows what I look like.
JUDY I'm sure it was because BARB was there.
JUDY You know how jealous she gets.
ANNIE Yeah, I'm sure that's it mom.

ANNIE Oh.
ANNIE Well, thank you.
STEVE But I think you need more dark up top to balance it out, do have any black beads?
ANNIE (looking at herself] That's actually a good idea.
ANNIE She starts to leave but sees a guilty look and some frosting on Steve's face.
ANNIE She looks over at her saran- 's.
ANNIE (CONT'D) How many moonpies have you eaten?
ANNIE (CONT'D) Tell me the truth.

ANNIE Ooooh.
ANNIE Yeah.
ANNIE Mine are out.
RHODES Yeah, and you're headin' up Witches Curve.
RHODES That's a risky move.
ANNIE I'm sorry.
ANNIE I usually only drive in the city and they've never pulled me over.
ANNIE To tell you the truth, those lights have been out for like a year.
RHODES Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy hot-dogger.
RHODES That is not something you wanna go broadcasting to a police officer.
RHODES I might feel obligated to give you a yea's worth of tickets now.
ANNIE What?
ANNIE No..
ANNIE I-
RHODES You just admitted it.
ANNIE Can you do that?
RHODES You admitted it.
RHODES (beat) Yeah, I can't do that though.

ANNIE I'm kind of in a hurry.
ANNIE I'm going to my best friend's engagement party, I'm the Maid of honor and so I really -
RHODES Oh, yeah.

RHODES She lost some of her hair from the stress.
RHODES Again, not funny.
ANNIE Am I getting a ticket?
ANNIE He searches for words.
ANNIE She's cute and he wants to keep her there.
ANNIE He keeps smiling.
ANNIE Awkward silence.
RHODES Uh, yeah.
RHODES That's what happens when you break the law.
RHODES Um...license and registration.
ANNIE Here.
ANNIE He writes a ticket.
RHODES (searching for words) Ooo, I like that air freshener.
RHODES Did you get that at the gas station?
ANNIE I don't remember.
RHODES Smells like Christmas.
RHODES (sniff) Yeah, it smells like Christmas.
RHODES He rips the ticket off.
RHODES (CONT'D) Well, here you go.
RHODES (CONT'D) And just so you know it's a just a fix-it ticket.
RHODES (CONT'D) So if you get those lights repaired, you wo't have to pay anything.
ANNIE Oh, Okay.
RHODES Whoa, are those moon-pies?
ANNIE Oh yeah.
RHODES (mumbling) Oh, those are my favorite.
ANNIE What?
RHODES Nothing.
RHODES (mumbling) Those are my favorite.
ANNIE Do you want one?
RHODES No.
RHODES It's too much trouble, they look all wrapped up.
RHODES She doesn't get the hint.
RHODES He really wants one.
RHODES (CONT'D) Well, have fun at your party.
RHODES (CONT'D) Annie drives off.
RHODES (CONT'D) He watches.
Annie, a little embarrassed, hands her keys to the valet and grabs the moon-pies.
She walks into an elegant country club dining room, lively cocktail party.
Music, happy people, etc.
She is greeted by Lillia's mom,
LAURIE Annie, sweetheart!
ANNIE Hi Mrs. Donovan!
ANNIE They hug.
LAURIE Oh!
LAURIE And you brought your famous moonpies!
LAURIE Laurie takes the tray.
Can you believe our Lillian?
ANNIE I know, I'm so happy for her.
LAURIE Well, clue me in.
LAURIE Is there anyone special in your life?
ANNIE Nope.
LAURIE That's my girl.
LAURIE (whisper) Sleep around.
LAURIE I'm serious.
LAURIE Travel the world and try all the cuisine you can.
LAURIE You know what I mean by that, right?
LAURIE MARY, Laurie's friend, approaches.
MARY Laurie, where did you get that sweater?
MARY It is one-hundred percent out-of-sight!
LAURIE Shhh, I got it at Glory Gay's.
MARY Ooooh.
MARY I can't even walk in there.
MARY The blouses alone make my wallet open.
LAURIE It's worth it, though huh?
LAURIE Mary, I want you to meet Lillian's Maid of Honor.
MARY Oh, very special job.
LAURIE This is Annie Walker.
LAURIE She lived next door to us in Milwaukee until the girls graduated from high school.

LILLIAN Ann!
ANNIE Lil!
ANNIE It was nice meeting you Mary.
ANNIE Annie leaves.
Her father ran off to Florida with a younger woman who was working at a Chrysler dealership.
MARY Oh my.
LAURIE Poor Judy, never quite got over it.
LAURIE She also ended up moving to Florida to take care of her parents.
MARY Oh, that is tough.
MARY Well it's nice Annie and Lillian have stayed friends.
LAURIE They're like sisters.
They continue gabbing as Annie rushes to Lillian.
They hug.
LILLIAN Hey!
ANNIE Hey!
ANNIE What's up?
ANNIE Where's Dougie?
LILLIAN Smoking a cigar with my dad.
LILLIAN Le's go get a drink.
LILLIAN They weave towards the bar.
DOUGIE Annie!!!
LILLIAN Hold on Dougie, we're getting drinks!
LILLIAN They get to the bar and grab glasses of wine.
ANNIE This place is so fancy.
ANNIE Dougie's parents belong here?
LILLIAN Yeah.
LILLIAN So does Dougie.
LILLIAN This is the tennis club I've been playing at.
ANNIE Oh.
ANNIE Wow.
ANNIE I guess it's not what I pictured.
ANNIE Lucky you.
LILLIAN Tennis courts are tennis courts if you ask me.
LILLIAN But I have met a lot of really cool people here.
LILLIAN I can't wait for you to meet the girls.
ANNIE Oh!
ANNIE So where's this guy you were telling me about?
Oh shoot, Matt's not coming.
I guess he got back together with his ex or something.
Anyway, Dougie just told me.
Sorry.
ANNIE That's ok.
DOUGIE There she is!
DOUGIE Dougie picks Annie up and swings her around.
LILLIAN Dougie, be careful.
LILLIAN God, you reek!
LILLIAN He puts her down.
DOUGIE Annie, make sure when my fiance gets cold feet you tell her what a great guy I am.
DOUGIE He grabs Lillian and kisses her on the cheek.
LILLIAN (waving the cigar scent away) Ugh.
LILLIAN Wash your face.
LILLIAN She gives in and kisses him.
LILLIAN Then says to Annie..
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Come on.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Let's go say hi to the rest of the bridal party.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) They approach LESLIE, Lillian's cousin, late 30's, standing with her husband PAUL.
ANNIE Leslie, hi!
ANNIE How are you guys?
LESLIE Well, I just squeezed my third kid out last month and I feel like I'm walking around in a fat suit.
LESLIE She swigs beer out of a bottle.
I keep telling her she looks great.
(beat) Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this your boyfriend?
A 30 YEAR OLD AVERAGE GUY with a neckbrace stands behind Annie.
Paul goes to shake his hand.
She stops him.
ANNIE No, no.
ANNIE (to the guy) Hi.
ANNIE (to them) No.
ANNIE Annie meets DANA who is with her husband Ernie.

DANA (CONT'D) So...how did you two meet?

So cheers to you two, our last single friends finally crossing over into the world of marital bliss, welcome to the other side!
Dana snaps a photo, crying.
Helen approaches the podium.
HELEN Hello everyone.
HELEN My name is Helen Harris the Third, an honored member of the bridal party.
HELEN In honor of Lillian and Dougie, I'd like to take this opportunity to read a poem that I penned last summer while I was sitting on a swing at an exclusive resort in Santorini.
HELEN Annie whispers to the person next to her.
ANNIE Am I supposed to give a speech?
ANNIE As Helen reads, Annie looks around the room and sees everyone in awe.
ANNIE Dana starts to cry.
ANNIE She reads from a fancy sheet of stationary.
HELEN With every blink of an eye, every kiss of a lip, every stroke of a lovers hand, every...scent of a woman, every breath you take, every move you make.
HELEN Love conquers all.
HELEN Annie sees that Lillian is touched.
HELEN Helen gets emotional.
HELEN (CONT'D) They say when you choose a mate, yo're choosing a best friend.
HELEN (CONT'D) Dougie, yo're a lucky man.
HELEN (CONT'D) Lillian, I know you're going to make a wonderful wife, because you have been the best friend that I could ever ask for.
HELEN (CONT'D) Annie's face goes blank.
HELEN (CONT'D) I have never had a friendship like this.
HELEN (CONT'D) I'm so happy you two are finally taking this big step together and I ca't wait for all of the adventures that await us.
HELEN (CONT'D) People are moved, sniffling.
HELEN (CONT'D) Including Lillian.
HELEN (CONT'D) Now a??Douglya??, sorry, inside joke.
HELEN (CONT'D) You better not keep my Lil on a leash.

HELEN (CONT'D) The room looks around.
HELEN (CONT'D) Annie slowly rises.
HELEN (CONT'D) There she is.
HELEN (CONT'D) Annie is our Maid of Honor everyone.
HELEN (CONT'D) And I'm sure she'd like to take this time to say a few words.
HELEN (CONT'D) Annie?
HELEN (CONT'D) Annie stands up to the applause.
HELEN (CONT'D) The room falls silent as she walks to the podium.

ANNIE (CONT'D) It's a good one, a good saying, it's Irish.
ANNIE (CONT'D) It's like a-like a toast.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Is it Irish?
ANNIE (CONT'D) Something about a road...Oh God, 'm blanking.
ANNIE (CONT'D) So I'll just say I'm so happy to be a part of this whole celebration and happiness.
ANNIE (CONT'D) You two are so happy together and hope you have a happy lifetime of happiness and celebrating.
ANNIE (CONT'D) And I love you and....Lillian, w've been best friends since we were like 5...'ve never been to Greece...
ANNIE (CONT'D) 't know if she's done.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Annie sees Helen has moved over to sit next to Lillian.
a??Did you ever know that you're my hero...You're everything I wish I could be..a?? C'mon you guys know the words.
Some people reluctantly sing along.
ANNIE (CONT'D) a??I could fly higher then an eagle.
ANNIE (CONT'D) For you are the wind beneath my wings.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Flyyy, flyyyyy, so fly into the sky, so fly until we touch up high--a??
Lillian and Annie are at the valet.
ANNIE Oh my God, tell me I didn't sing.
LILLIAN No, you sang.
LILLIAN They both laugh.
ANNIE God, I don't know, I was just maybe a little out of my element, and after Helen's speech--
LILLIAN Ann, stop.
ANNIE I'm so embarrassed.
ANNIE What did you think of your engagement party?
LILLIAN Besides the impromptu concert from Bette Midler, it was perfect.
LILLIAN They laugh and hug.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) I gotta go say bye to some people I do't know.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Drive safe.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Lillian goes back inside.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Helen appears out of thin air.
HELEN Annie!
HELEN Great job tonight..
ANNIE I'm feeling slightly mortified.
HELEN No, nononono.
HELEN Not at all.
HELEN Everyone gets a little nervous and carried away during those kind of things.
HELEN So listen, 've been brainstorming some theme ideas for Lillian's shower.
HELEN I was thinking somewhere along the lines of Alice in Wonderland meets...are you ready?
HELEN Hollywood.
HELEN And for the bachelorette?
HELEN Vegas.
ANNIE Aren't I supposed to be planning some of these things?
HELEN Oh, well, I hadn't heard from you and--
ANNIE She just got engaged two weeks ago.
HELEN Well, I figured since you don't have any experience that you might get overwhelmed by events of this caliber.
ANNIE Helen, I'm pretty capable.
ANNIE I think I can handle it.
ANNIE A guest walks by and taps Helen.
Excuse me, you left your poem inside.
You have beautiful cursive.
HELEN Thank you.
HELEN The guest says nothing to Annie and walks away.
HELEN (CONT'D) Annie, I didn't mean I didn't think you couldn't do it.
HELEN (CONT'D) I'm sure you are aware of all your duties.
HELEN (CONT'D) We'll see--we'll see you soon.
HELEN (CONT'D) Helen walks away.
HELEN (CONT'D) A OLD LADY passes by her.
WOMAN You're very pretty.
MEGAN Annie!
MEGAN Megan is running towards her with a piece of paper.
MEGAN (CONT'D) Annie wait!
MEGAN (CONT'D) I wanna give you my numbers.
MEGAN (CONT'D) A place just opened up near my house.
MEGAN (CONT'D) From 4-7 every weekday, Karaoke, two dollar wings and all you can eat MAN sandwiches if you know what I mean.

ANNIE Oh, great!
Donna and Annie are eating lunch in the break-room.
DONNA And then they put a solution in my eyes to dilate them, which caused temporary blindness and with the loss of my sight, my hearing became bionic.
DONNA Do you need some help dear?
DONNA Annie struggles to open a bag of chips but her new ULTRA LONG, french-manicured nail-tips are making it very hard.
ANNIE No, I got it.
Annie and Donna are doing inventory.
Annie gets text.
ANNIE Sorry...
ANNIE Well, it's official.
ANNIE Lillian set a date.

ANNIE Why did I just get a stomach ache.
DONNA Don't be nervous.
DONNA It's not all on your shoulders.
DONNA Doesnt she have other bridesmaids?
ANNIE Yeah and they've all done this before so I'm feeling a little pressure.
ANNIE I have to make this really nice for Lillian.
DONNA I wish I could help.
DONNA Weddings are a lot different now then they were in my day.
DONNA They look at Donna's wedding picture on her desk.
ANNIE That dress is beautiful.
DONNA I still have it.
DONNA I was hoping my daughter Elizabeth would wear it but when she and Alice had their a??ceremonya?? they both wanted to wear suits.
DONNA (beat) Ok, we need two Shannisburg tennis bracelets.
DONNA Annie struggles to write with her nails.
ANNIE Oops.
ANNIE Hold on a sec, hard to write...
DONNA They're very long.
ANNIE Hi.
ANNIE I need to make these shorter.
NAIL TECHNICIAN No, not sexy!

ANNIE She sees a buzzer.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Oh, I didn't see that.
ANNIE (CONT'D) She presses the buzzer.
VOICE FROM INSIDE Hello?
ANNIE Hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids dresses.
VOICE FROM INSIDE What's your name?
ANNIE Oh, Annie.
VOICE FROM INSIDE (snotty) What's the reservation name?
ANNIE (to the girls) Oh, she must be talking about the restaurant.
ANNIE (back into the intercom) No, we're here to look at dresses.
VOICE FROM INSIDE I heard you the first time.
VOICE FROM INSIDE So I take it you don't have a reservation for the dress shop?
BECCA (whispers) You didn't make a reservation?
ANNIE Um, no, I'm sorry, I didn't know I had to make a reservation for that.
ANNIE Sorry!
ANNIE Anyway, we're all out here now and--
VOICE FROM INSIDE The next available appointment for bridesmaid fittings is in seven weeks and we don't take reservations over the intercom so you'll have to call.
ANNIE Seven weeks?!
VOICE FROM INSIDE I'm sorry maybe you can't hear me.
VOICE FROM INSIDE I just said a few seconds ago that we do't have a reservation for the next seven weeks.
And when you make your reservation do't forget you'll also need to make an appointment.
ANNIE What?
DANA (whispers) You didn't make an appointment?
ANNIE No, I can hear you.
ANNIE Would it be possible for you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here and I didn't know about the reservation/ appointment thing so...
VOICE FROM INSIDE Hold on.
LILLIAN Annie, we can go somewhere else.
ANNIE No, no.
ANNIE I'll work it out.
ANNIE Don't worry.

a??OCCASIONZ' BRIDAL SHOP.
DAYTIME.
Whitney and Helen are leading the girls down the hall.
Lillian and Annie tail the group.
LILLIAN Ann, don't worry about it.
LILLIAN We got in.
LILLIAN Annie sees racks of wedding dresses.
ANNIE Hey, you want to sneak off and look at the wedding dresses?
LILLIAN Oh my God.
LILLIAN Annie, I didn't tell you?
LILLIAN Guess who Helen is friends with?
LILLIAN Lady Lavonia Jean St.
LILLIAN Petsois JuJu.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) That famous wedding dress designer tha's in all those wedding magazines?
LILLIAN (CONT'D) As a favor to Helen she's going to design my dress for almost nothing.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Normally they're like twenty grand.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) She's French.
ANNIE Wow.
ANNIE That's amazing.
I have to send my measurements to France.
Annie is a little disappointed.
They all stand in a room stuffed bridesmaids dresses.
Lillian's cell phone rings.
LILLIAN Surprise, surprise.
LILLIAN It's my Mom.
LILLIAN Mom?
LILLIAN Can you hold on a second?
LILLIAN She covers the phone and talks to the girls.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Start looking at dresses.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) I'll be right back.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) I think maybe you guys should decide anyway and pick out something you like since you're the ones wearing it.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Cool?
LILLIAN (CONT'D) (nodding) Have fun!
LILLIAN (CONT'D) What's up Mom?
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Ugh!
LILLIAN (CONT'D) They're booked?
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Lillian leaves talking to her Mom.
HELEN Ok ladies, start your (french) engines!
HELEN Shots of dresses being pulled off of the racks.
HELEN Fighting for the same dress, shirts coming off, dresses zipped up the back and dresses not fitting, etc.
Annie loves the dress she has on.
She talks to herself in the mirror.
ANNIE Hi I'm Annie.
ANNIE Can I get a martini?
ANNIE What you mean you need to see I.D.?
Annie, in the dress, is talking to the bartender.
Well, with that dress on you look about...
.eleven.
ANNIE Thank you.
ANNIE Annie laughs.
ANNIE And turns away right into, a GORGEOUS male model in a tuxedo.
Excuse me, you dropped an earring.
An UNDERWEAR MODEL appears, in his underwear.
I'll get it for her.
No I will!
I'll get it!
I'm a lifeguard.
Tons of men begin to yell and fight over her.
The chaos forces Annie to make a DRAMATIC EXIT from the CASTLE.
She runs down the stairs like Cinderella into the forest.
They men begin to chase her.
She runs through the trees out of breath, she is face to face with a sexy, sweaty, lumberjack, wh's chopping wood.
It's CHRISTIAN BALE.
ANNIE Hi.
CHRISTIAN BALE Hi.
CHRISTIAN BALE I'm Christian Bale.
CHRISTIAN BALE I'm just chopping some wood, I like to do that between movies.
ANNIE Hello Christian.
ANNIE They hear the voices of the men from the party screaming for her.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Oh, Christian!
ANNIE (CONT'D) I need a place to hide.
CHRISTIAN BALE Quick, get inside my muscles.
CHRISTIAN BALE They embrace.
I love this sash.
They look into each others' eyes, just about to kiss and--
HELEN Hi Annie!
Helen has flung open Annie's dressing room curtain, putting an abrupt end to her fantasy.
She is wearing cream colored lingerie, showing off her TOTALLY amazing body.
Annie is uncomfortable.
HELEN Look at your cute little boobies.
HELEN Ooh, is that the dress you like?
ANNIE Yeah.
ANNIE I think it will look good on everybody, it has a sash--
HELEN A sash?
HELEN Annie, this isn't the Sound of Music tryouts.
ANNIE Huh?
DANA I told you Becca I can't wear strapless!
BECCA Why not?!
BECCA Annie and Helen come out to see all the bridesmaids arguing.
DANA Because, I--
LESLIE Why don't you two shut your traps?
LESLIE No one's going to be looking at us.
LESLIE Le's just get the one with the shawl, 'm always freezing at these things anyway.
MEGAN I gotta say I'm still leaning towards the one that I found.
MEGAN It is a very ugly.
LESLIE Absolutely not.
ANNIE Well, what about this one?
ANNIE Everybody stops and looks at Annie.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I think it would be flattering on everyone and we could totally wear it again.
ANNIE (CONT'D) The sash comes in different colors not just this one.
HELEN Everyone!
HELEN We can't all have the dress that we want.
HELEN I've been in a lot of weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid dress, you must ask yourself, a??If invited, would I wear this a dress to...The ACADEMY AWARDS!a??
DANA Ooo, I never thought of it that way.
DANA All the girls agree.
HELEN With that in mind, I say we wear this one.
HELEN Helen holds up a dress.
HELEN The girls like it.
ANNIE Or this one!
ANNIE People wear sashes to the Academy Awards all the time.
HELEN Only if they're nominated for the Sound of Music.
ANNIE I think Lillian would like this one.
HELEN Well, I think Lillian would like THIS one.
HELEN Lillian walks in.
LILLIAN Hey!
LILLIAN I'm hearing lots of excitement in here.
LILLIAN She touches Helen's dress.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Oooo, I like this one.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) What about you guys?
HELEN I love it.
HELEN Right guys?
HELEN The girls all agree.
HELEN Except Annie.
LILLIAN Cool.
LILLIAN Let's eat!
LILLIAN Helen dumps the dress in Annie's arms and follows Lillian.
HELEN I think it might look best in cream.
LILLIAN Ooh, good idea.
LILLIAN They exit.
LESLIE Well, that was easy.
LESLIE The girls head back to change.
ANNIE This dress is almost $500!
That's not too bad/that sounds about right.
ANNIE No, that's what I'm saying.
ANNIE That's a great price.
EXT.
a??OCCASIONZ RESTAURANT' BRIDAL-THEMED CAFE.
PATIO.
Andrea Bocceli music playing.
Waiters in tuxes etc.
The girls sit at a beautiful table looking at men's.
LILLIAN This place is kind of amazing.
LILLIAN I did't even know it existed.
BECCA The southwestern cobb is really good.
BECCA I come here and eat sometimes.
MEGAN Great, there's a fly that really likes me.
ANNIE They only have salads.
DANA So Annie, what's your deal?
DANA Are you dating anyone?
ANNIE No, no.
ANNIE Not right now.
ANNIE I had a boyfriend for three years but we broke up like six months ago.
BECCA Oh, I hate to hear stuff like that!
BECCA What happened?
ANNIE It just didn't work out.
HELEN Is that the guy who stole a bunch of money from you and gave you an STD?
HELEN Everyone freezes.
HELEN (CONT'D) Lillian told me.
HELEN (CONT'D) Annie shoots Lillian a look.
LILLIAN I'm sorry, I was just talking about you cause I was worried about you and--
ANNIE No it's fine.
ANNIE But he didn't steal the money, I loaned it to him.
ANNIE And HPV is really common right now.
ANNIE Everyone looks around.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Around fifty percent of sexually active men and women acquire HPV at some point in their lives and by age fifty, eighty percent of women will be infected with a genital HPV infection.
LESLIE Really?
ANNIE About 6.2 million new cases of HPV affect Americans each year.
MEGAN Ew, it's on the butter you guys.
MEGAN The fly's on the butter.
HELEN Well, I don't have it.
ANNIE Very few HPV infections show any signs or symptoms.
ANNIE Therefore a lot of infected people don't even know they have it, yet they transmit the virus to their sexual partner.
ANNIE Silent.
ANNIE Everyone is a little grossed out..
ANNIE (CONT'D) Anyway, it's fine, the past is the past.
ANNIE (CONT'D) We weren't meant to be.
ANNIE (CONT'D) My last pap-smear came back normal so that's cule.
ANNIE (CONT'D) But you know, I'm dating, here and there...
HELEN Do you have anyone in mind to bring to the wedding?
ANNIE Oh, I didn't even think about that.
LESLIE Who needs a date?
LESLIE Just go stag and make out with someone there.
DANA If you wanna meet a nice man, Annie, you should come to karaoke night at my church.
DANA We sing hymns to rock beats!
BECCA Wait.
BECCA I have the perfect guy for you Annie.
BECCA Mike Donahue.
BECCA He went to school with Kevin.
LILLIAN Mike from the fourth of July last year?
LILLIAN Ooh, I've seen him Ann.
LILLIAN He's hot.
ANNIE Really?
BECCA And Kevin said he just sold his company for an embarrassing amount of money.
BECCA But he's totally down to earth.
BECCA You guys have to meet.
BECCA I'm texting Kevin right now.
HELEN I know Mike too.
HELEN Megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter.
MEGAN The fly just committed suicide.
MEGAN Death by butter.
DANA Oh my gosh, if you guys got married you could live out here and see us all the time!
LESLIE Yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit around and talk about nothing while your vagina flaps in the wind like a wet paper towel.
HELEN (sotto) Oooh, I didn't know we were going to hear that word at lunch today.
DANA I was set up with Ernie.
DANA As soon as I met him, I knew.
LILLIAN Yeah Annie, you never know.
ANNIE Yes.
Annie is lost in thought.
She hears.
Sirens.
ANNIE What?!
ANNIE Come on!
ANNIE She pulls over.
ANNIE Officer Rhodes approaches.
RHODES Well, look who it is.
ANNIE Oh hi.
RHODES I see your still driving around with busted tail lights.
ANNIE I'm sorry, money's been tight and...I forgot(laughing).
ANNIE You're not gonna give me another ticket for that are you?
RHODES Nah...
RHODES The reason I pulled you over today, is that--(searching) you were driving too slow.
RHODES Backing up traffic.
ANNIE I was?
RHODES Yep.
RHODES You were going ten miles under the speed limit.
RHODES That's a moving violation.
RHODES It's...underdriving.
RHODES It's in the books.
RHODES But, I'm just going to give you a warning this time, but I do have to um...write some stuff down on a piece of paper.
RHODES He begins to write.
RHODES Beat.
RHODES (CONT'D) Man I'm hungry.
RHODES (CONT'D) I'm doing the Master Cleanse.
RHODES (CONT'D) You ever heard of it?
ANNIE Yeah.
RHODES Cayenne pepper water for three days now.
RHODES It's supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter.
RHODES It's working.
RHODES The only problem is I get so hungry.
RHODES I just want a big slab of ribs.
RHODES You ever crave that kind of stuff?
ANNIE Don't talk about cravings right now.
ANNIE I am PMS'ing like crazy.
ANNIE It's taking everything in me not to stop and the store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine.
ANNIE I'm so irritable right now.
ANNIE They stare at each other out of awkwardness.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Sorry.
RHODES No, it's OK, I've got three sisters.
RHODES We had tampons in the pencil drawer.
RHODES Sometimes my friends and I would say they were cigars and smoke'em.
RHODES (beat) Okay.
RHODES I have finished writing down the things I need to write, on this paper.
RHODES OH!
RHODES He hands her a business card.
RHODES (CONT'D) This is a buddy of mine.
RHODES (CONT'D) Owns a body shop in Milwaukee.
RHODES (CONT'D) Might be able to help you out for a good price with those taillights.
RHODES (CONT'D) I'll write my name on here so you can tell him who referred you.
ANNIE Thanks.
RHODES That's my name right there.
RHODES In case you forgot it from last time.
RHODES It's Nathan Rhodes.
ANNIE Thanks.
ANNIE Annie.
ANNIE I'll get those fixed.
ANNIE I get paid next week.
ANNIE Bye!
ANNIE She drives off.
ANNIE Rhodes wishes he had been more suave.
ANNIE Trust me, I've been in the jewelry business for a long time.
ANNIE Nothing says a??I'm sorry for your loss' like a sterling silver money clip.
ANNIE An OLD WOMAN CUSTOMER looks at her stone-faced.
ANNIE (CONT'D) We also have yo-yos you can engrave.
ANNIE (CONT'D) In memory of...um, what's your friend's name?
ANNIE (CONT'D) The old woman walks away as Sandy approaches.
SANDY Paychecks.
SANDY Here you go Annie.
SANDY She and Sandy open their checks.
Oh my God, I scored this week.
'm gonna buy Sharita a new Panasonic telephone.
It's cordless and has intercom.
What about you Annie?
ANNIE I'm gonna pay for a cream-colored gown that I'll never wear again.
Annie is on the phone as she gets ready for her date with Mike.
ANNIE Help me!
ANNIE I can't find anything to wear for my date with Mike tonight.
LILLIAN I don't know.
LILLIAN Shoot, I can't talk now.
LILLIAN I'm with Helen and we have a conference call with Lady Lavonia Jean St.
LILLIAN Petsois JuJu about my dress.
LILLIAN Ugh.
LILLIAN I'm so sorry.
LILLIAN She's calling!
LILLIAN I gotta go.
LILLIAN Have fun!
LILLIAN Lillian hangs up.
LILLIAN Steve walks in.
STEVE That credit lady called you again.
STEVE I told her you were at the tailors.
ANNIE Listen, I'm going on a date.
ANNIE This?
ANNIE (holds up a dress) or this?
STEVE I don't like those pants.
ANNIE What's wrong with'em?
STEVE They give you four corners.
STEVE Annie's not following.
STEVE (CONT'D) It's when a girls butt looks like it has four corners.
STEVE (CONT'D) It's not a good thing.
ANNIE Shit.
ANNIE These are my only clean pants.
STEVE Do you have a tube skirt?
ANNIE Thanks Steve.
STEVE Wait.
STEVE If you stand like you are right now facing that angle, it looks good.
STEVE She looks in the mirror again, grabs her bag and leaves.
Annie sits next to Mike Donahue.
He is tall, dark and handsome.
They have cocktails.
ANNIE I'm not an expert in corporate real- estate but I've always been interested in it.
ANNIE So, yeah I totally agree.
ANNIE Mike smiles, he is cute!
MIKE I have to admit, I told Becca 'm not really keen on set-ups.
MIKE I know i's early, but so far so good.
ANNIE Me too.
MIKE And thanks again for coming from Milwaukee, I know it's quite a drive.
ANNIE I can do that drive in my sleep these days.
MIKE Next time maybe I'll come to you.
MIKE Annie smiles.
MIKE (CONT'D) You have got great teeth.
ANNIE Thank you.
ANNIE I brush'em every day.
ANNIE She flashes her teeth.
ANNIE The hostess comes up.
Your tables ready.
MIKE Finally!
MIKE Mike guzzles down his cocktail as they read their menus.
MIKE (CONT'D) Well, I don't know about you but since we're at a Thai restaurant, I'm gonna try the dog.
MIKE (CONT'D) Mike laughs at his own joke and continues drinking.
ANNIE So, Becca tells me you play a lot of tennis.
MIKE I try to squeeze in a game now and then.
MIKE We should play sometime.
ANNIE Oh, yeah I haven't rea--
Yeah, my game's pretty solid.
I did win a couple tournaments at the club.
I tend to- Jesus Christ!
(whispers) It smells like B.O.
in here huh?
I think it's the people.
A very effeminate waiter brings them their drinks.
WAITER Here ya go.
WAITER I'll be back to take your order in two secs.
WAITER I'm swamped!
ANNIE No problem.
MIKE Whoa, get a load of our waiter.
MIKE 'm surprised he didn't put pink umbrellas in our drinks...
MIKE Annie laughs, but is a little uncomfortable.
MIKE (CONT'D) Or AIDS.
MIKE (CONT'D) Mike laughs.
MIKE (CONT'D) Annie is HORRIFIED.
MIKE (CONT'D) Mike swigs from his drink.
MIKE (CONT'D) Seriously, AIDS is crazy.
MIKE (CONT'D) You do't have it do you?
ANNIE No.
MIKE (singing) Neither do I...
MIKE He raises his eyebrows up and down at her.
Annie hasn't touched her food.
He's eating with his hands and drunk.
Other patrons are beginning to stare.
So I started to get a little chub, you know what that is.
How could I not with those huge canteloupes waving in my face.
Anyway, I looovee massages, am I right?
As he's laughing he lets out a huge burp.
MIKE (CONT'D) (still laughing) Whoa-ho!
MIKE (CONT'D) Excyuuuuse me!
MIKE (CONT'D) I got that from Steve Martin.
MIKE (CONT'D) Still laughing, he pats his pockets.
MIKE (CONT'D) Oh shit.
MIKE (CONT'D) I forgot my wallet.
Annie's car pulls up.
Annie is on the phone, looking at the herbal drinks.
a??Calma?? a??Focusa?? a??Sex Appeala?? a??Leana??.
She finally picks a??Calma??.
RHODES appears holding a bag of mini carrots.
ANNIE Hey, it's me, I just had to tell you about my night.
ANNIE Oh my God.
ANNIE Call me.
RHODES Annie Walker.
RHODES I thought I heard your car out there.
ANNIE Very funny, Officer...Jones?
RHODES Jones?
RHODES Oh boy.
RHODES Guess somebody thought he was a little more memorable than he was.
ANNIE No.
ANNIE Sorry.
ANNIE I'm a little out of it.
ANNIE I'm not drunk.
RHODES That's ok.
RHODES Call me Rhodes.
RHODES (notices her drink) Trying to get a??calma???
ANNIE Yeah.
ANNIE Recovering from a date.
RHODES Oh.
ANNIE Finish your cleanse?
RHODES Yeah, trying to wean myself back to the really bad foods I like eating.
ANNIE Thanks for the drink.
ANNIE (beat) So are you one of those cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people?
RHODES A lot of people get up to high speeds on this road.
RHODES I tell people its better to pay for a ticket than have your family pay for a funeral.
ANNIE That's a very good point.
OFFICER RHODES Want a carrot?
ANNIE Yes.
ANNIE I'm starving.
CONTINUOUS They are leaning on the back of his car eating carrots.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Ew!
ANNIE (CONT'D) What is this?
ANNIE (CONT'D) Annie pulls out a very dry, warped discolored carrot.
RHODES Oh, you got the ugly carrot.
ANNIE The what?
RHODES There's one in every bag.
RHODES You should eat it.
ANNIE No.
ANNIE I think you should eat it.
ANNIE The're your carrots.
ANNIE He goes to eat it.
ANNIE She grabs it out of his hands.
ANNIE (CONT'D) No, no!
ANNIE (CONT'D) Don't eat it!
ANNIE (CONT'D) EW!!!
ANNIE (CONT'D) She throws it on the ground.
RHODES Don't litter.
RHODES He picks it up.
ANNIE I don't think I've ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life.
RHODES Yeah, I don't go on blind dates.
RHODES It seems unnatural.
ANNIE I have no idea what am I going to tell my friends who set us up.
RHODES Just tell her the truth.
ANNIE Yeah.
ANNIE You're probably right.
ANNIE Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car.
ANNIE (CONT'D) It's an ok job.
ANNIE (CONT'D) It's commission, so it's unpredictable.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I don't know, I always wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's kind of financially impossible right now.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Plus I'd feel like ninety around all those college students.
RHODES You know my dad used to say that life is like a hallway of doors.
RHODES You can stand at the same door forever if you want.
RHODES Or you can open a different door.
RHODES And that one may not be the right door, but i'll open up a whole new hallway of doors.
RHODES Anyway, it worked for me.
RHODES I was kinda lost and I opened a door and the next thing I knew I was a cop.
RHODES And I love my job.
ANNIE Hmm.
ANNIE I think I get it?
RHODES Or you can always sell moon-pies by the side of the road.
ANNIE Moonpies.
ANNIE What?
RHODES It's a joke.
RHODES You had moon-pies in your car the first time I pulled you over.
ANNIE Oh yeah.
They are waiting in line.
OFFICER RHODES When I get married I don't want the kind of wedding people have these days.
OFFICER RHODES I want it to be like a carnival.
OFFICER RHODES You know dunk tanks?
OFFICER RHODES People win prizes...
ANNIE Yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze artists and a big scale to guess the bride's weight.
OFFICER RHODES Ok, first of all that's a circus wedding and I'm talking about a carnival wedding.
ANNIE Sorry.
ANNIE (to clerk) Yeah I'll have the number four, and can you make that Super Biggie?
They are sitting in the restaurant, mouths full of
OFFICER RHODES And then she moved to Hawaii and now lives with a guy who sells shaved ice.
OFFICER RHODES And supposedly she has really long armpit hair now.
OFFICER RHODES That's pretty much the last girlfriend I had.
ANNIE Well, lets just say my last boyfriend that I lived with broke up with me over the phone.
ANNIE Then come to find out, he had borrowed $30,000 in my name without telling me, putting me in horrible debt that I'm still paying off.
ANNIE Because I can't find him.
OFFICER RHODES Wow.
OFFICER RHODES You win.
Annie in her car, engine running.
ANNIE Oh my gosh.
ANNIE It's twelve thirty!
ANNIE I should probably...
RHODES Oh, before you go.
RHODES There is something I want to give you.
RHODES I was gonna wait but, I think you'll want this now.
RHODES He jokingly gives her the ugly carrot.
ANNIE For me?!
OFFICER RHODES Well I know you've had a terrible night.
OFFICER RHODES He gives it to her.
OFFICER RHODES Her phone rings.
ANNIE Sorry, one sec.
ANNIE Hello?
ANNIE Ted!?
ANNIE Hey!
ANNIE Oh my gosh!
ANNIE No,no.
ANNIE Can you hold on a sec?
ANNIE She waves at Rhodes and mouths...
ANNIE (CONT'D) I guess I'll see you around?
RHODES Yeah.
RHODES Don't forget about those taillights.
RHODES They're really starting to bug me.
ANNIE K.
ANNIE Bye.(to Ted) So, you're in town?
He opens the front door, leading Annie out again.
TED Next time I won't call so late.
ANNIE No, it was fine.
ANNIE Like I said, I mean I was just driving.
TED Awesome.
TED It's cool that we can just hookup and whatever.
TED No strings.
ANNIE Me too.
ANNIE I love it.
ANNIE I feel good right now.
TED Cool.
TED Bye.
Annie pulls in, her tank is way passed empty.
She looks in her purse frantically.
ANNIE Shit!!
ANNIE No!
ANNIE No!
ANNIE I left my fucking credit card at the restaurant!
ANNIE Shit!
ANNIE She picks up her phone and dials.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Hi, Donna, it's Annie.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Um, sorry but I just ran out of gas and I'm gonna be a little bit late.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Yes, I know, 'm really sorry.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I will get there as soon as I can.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I promise, I'm so sor---hello?
INT. HARRINGTON'S JEWELRY STORE. Annie comes running onto the floor putting her tie on.
HELEN Annie, hi!
HELEN I almost left, but they said that you were coming and that you were late.
HELEN Helen is standing there looking gorgeous.
HELEN (CONT'D) I had to come into Milwaukee for a charity luncheon right down the street and I thought I'd come in and say hi.
ANNIE Hi!
HELEN And as the leader of the bridesmaids, I thought it'd be fun to pick up some little gifts for all the girls.
ANNIE Leader of the bridesmaids?
ANNIE Um, wouldn't that technically be me?
ANNIE Honor?
HELEN Well, no, sweetie, you're the Maid of Honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out of all of us, I'm the leader.
HELEN Anyway, it doesn't matter.
HELEN Um, I wanted to get something that we could wear to the rehearsal dinner or something.
HELEN That would be fun.
HELEN Where are the diamonds?
ANNIE Oh, well, what about a nice pen..or a tortoise-shell handled sterling silver letter opener?
ANNIE No?
ANNIE Ok, let me get Sandy.
HELEN Oh!
HELEN And Annie we really need to start planning the bachelorette.
ANNIE Yes.
ANNIE Yes.
ANNIE I'm on it.
ANNIE Got some ideas.
ANNIE So I'll let you know.
HELEN Can't wait.
Annie arrives home from work frazzled to find Steve on the couch watching the same Home Improvement show.
Wow, well I have never seen a transformation like this.
This old tour bus is stunning.
Thanks.
STEVE Unbelievable.
STEVE (to Annie) You got another package from your mom.
ANNIE Hey thanks for saving my butt today.
ANNIE Like I said I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
ANNIE She opens the package.
ANNIE And pulls out a red blazer.
STEVE No problem.
STEVE But you should always put gas in when it gets to a quarter tank.
STEVE Especially cause you have such a shitty car.
ANNIE Thanks.
ANNIE Can I ask you a question?
ANNIE What do you think of Vegas?
STEVE Ooo.
STEVE Let me turn this off.
STEVE Vegas is a black hole but I must have it in my life.
STEVE Does that make sense?
ANNIE I'm just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for Lillia's bachelorette party and I've never been.
STEVE Oh no.
STEVE Now I don't know about weddings.
STEVE When you go on a bachelorette, does the bride pay?
ANNIE No, everyone pays for themselves.
ANNIE And you pay for the bride.
STEVE Ok, I'm gonna say no.
STEVE You cannot afford that.
STEVE Vegas is not cheap.
STEVE Airfare, hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show tickets.
STEVE Remember this morning?
STEVE You cannot afford Vegas.
ANNIE Well, I could save up for it.
STEVE No, you need to win a contest to go to Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday.
STEVE Ooh, a??Night Moves.a?? Can I have this?
STEVE A lightbulb goes off in Annie's head.
STEVE Steve holds the blazer out and reads the tag.
ANNIE Told you I'd pay you back!
ANNIE Annie runs into her room.
ANNIE She sits down at the computer and begins typing feverishly.
ANNIE We see these words: a??Dear bridal partya??, a??great ideaa??, a??bachelorette partya??, a??Floridaa??, a??Sea World!a??, a??Free place to stay!a??.
ANNIE She presses send, and is very pleased.
ANNIE The phone immediately rings.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Hello?
HELEN Hi.
ANNIE Hi.
HELEN Hiiiii.
ANNIE Hi Helen.
ANNIE Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket.
ANNIE All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles.
ANNIE There are too many flames.
HELEN I just got your e-mail.
HELEN Um...Sea World?
ANNIE Well it's not just Sea World.
ANNIE It's a weekend in Florida.
ANNIE See, when Lillian and I were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back.
ANNIE Ask Dougie.
ANNIE I think it would really mean a lot to her.
ANNIE We could stay at my Dad's house, he won't even be there.
ANNIE Then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then Sea World on one of the days.
HELEN But a bachelorette at Sea World?
ANNIE Like I said, Sea World would just be a part of it.
HELEN Well, I have been talking to the other girls, and I was thinking we should go to Las Vegas!
HELEN Annie's other line rings.
ANNIE Oh, can you hold on?
ANNIE That's my other line.
ANNIE She clicks over.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Hello?
BECCA Hi, Annie.
BECCA It's Becca.
BECCA Becca, in her shabby-chic home office paints a front porch sign that says a??The Whitman'sa??
BECCA (CONT'D) I was just looking at your e-mail, yo're so cute.
BECCA (CONT'D) Sea World.
BECCA (CONT'D) What about Turkey?
BECCA (CONT'D) That's where we went for for MY bachelorette.
ANNIE Oh well, Turkey's really far away.
BECCA It's super old though!
BECCA They have awesome restaurants.
BECCA It's very exotic.
BECCA Have you ever seen Aladdin?
BECCA It totally looks like that.
ANNIE Hang on...
ANNIE Annie clicks back over to Helen.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Helen, I'm sorry can I call you back?
HELEN When?
ANNIE Just a few minutes.
ANNIE I'll call you back.
ANNIE Annie clicks over.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Becca?
BECCA Hi.
BECCA You know, if you wanna go some place closer than Turkey.
BECCA Helen JUST e-mailed me about going to Vegas.
ANNIE Oh, I don't know.
ANNIE Everybody always goes to Vegas.
ANNIE It seems just cliche to me.
BECCA I never get sick of it.
BECCA I love blackjack.
BECCA I have a system.
BECCA Annie's other line.
ANNIE Oh, my other line's ringing.
ANNIE Can I call you back?
BECCA When?
ANNIE Soon.
ANNIE Annie clicks over.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Hello?
DANA Annie, it's Dana!
ANNIE Of course it is..
ANNIE Dana is on her porch swing drinking lemonade.
DANA I love your idea about Sea World.
ANNIE Really?
DANA Yeah, but then Helen just called me and said we should go to Vegas.
ANNIE But Vegas is so hot, don't you think?
ANNIE It's like, hot and dry.
ANNIE People get sick there all the time.
DANA I haven't had that experience.
DANA My skin always clears up there.
ANNIE Yeah, I just think it's probably not-- Hold on.
ANNIE (clicks over) Hello?
MEGAN Annie, it's Megan.
MEGAN Megan is at work, in front of a wall of computer and television screens.
MEGAN It is a technical haven, looks like
MEGAN (CONT'D) I can't talk right now, but I was thinking for the bachelorette, something more along the lines of a personal challenge weekend.
MEGAN (CONT'D) Have you ever heard of the Nevada Project?
ANNIE (defeated) No.
ANNIE Leslie in her Sopranos style living room on a treadmill.
ANNIE Her kids run around.
LESLIE I gotta be honest.
LESLIE I've been married for nine years, this may be the last bachelorette party of my career and I want the sweaty nuggets of a gay man pounding me in the face at some point during this trip.
LESLIE I'll pay whatever I have to pay.
LESLIE (to the kids) Tyler stop it, put that back!
LESLIE Paul!
BECCA Vegas has these party busses that have flat screens in them and dance floors--
DANA Or we could take hummer limos around everywhere.
ANNIE That sounds really expensive.
HELEN Oh but it's gonna be so much fun!
HELEN Besides money shouldn't be a problem if Lillian's our friend.
ANNIE Oh no, no, I was just thinking about everyone else.
ANNIE That's all I'm saying.
MEGAN What I'm saying is, they drop you off in the middle of the desert.
MEGAN You have to kill your own food and find your way back.
MEGAN Not everyone makes it.
MEGAN Seriously.
LESLIE Seriously.
LESLIE I want balls in my face.
BECCA So I think Vegas is a good idea.
DANA I agree with Helen.
DANA Vegas.
MEGAN Oh, you know what else is in Nevada?
MEGAN Vegas!
LESLIE Balls.
LESLIE Vegas.
HELEN Vegas it is.
LILLIAN (on the phone) Holy Shit Annie!
LILLIAN We're goin' to Vegas!
SANDY No can do, I need all my shifts.
SANDY 'm trying to save up and take my lady to Maui.
ANNIE Please, one day a week, just for a little while.
ANNIE I've already asked everybody else.
ANNIE I really need the money.
SANDY Sorry.
SANDY My hands are tied.
SANDY Sharita's got my dick in a chip-clip.
ANNIE That's alright.
ANNIE I understand.
SANDY Mmm.
SANDY Mm.
SANDY These are the best peanut butter titties you ever made.
ANNIE They're called peanut butter kisses.
SANDY That's not what they look like.
The bridesmaids sit in first class.
In the distance, Annie's head pops up from her seat in row 3O of coach.
The girls wait by the curb with their luggage.
Megan appears next to Annie.
MEGAN Here we are.
MEGAN The city of lust.
MEGAN Annie, do you know how many men are looking for trouble in this town right now?
MEGAN We are gonna nail it down.
MEGAN We should tell everybody we're twins cause guys looking up with twins!
ANNIE Yeah, I've heard that.
ANNIE Ok everybody!
ANNIE You guys, hey we're here, we're in Vegas!
ANNIE Woo!
ANNIE Lillian walks up.
LILLIAN Annie, come here.
LILLIAN Why didn't you tell me you weren't sitting with us?
ANNIE Oh, it's no big deal.
ANNIE I didn't want to blow all my money on a first class ticket.
ANNIE I'm here though, right?!
LILLIAN I'm so excited!
ANNIE Ok, you guys, gather around.
ANNIE Welcome to Lillian's bachelorette party!
ANNIE We should probably get a bunch of cabs and head to our beautiful hotel, The New Marquis Royal Suites...
ANNIE As Annie's talking, a limo pulls up behind her.
ANNIE a??The New Marquis Royal Suites.a??
HELEN Lillian, look what's happening.
LILLIAN Oh my God.
LILLIAN You guys, is this for us?!
HELEN I got a limo from the hotel.
HELEN We're in Vegas!
HELEN Yaaaay!!
HELEN They all pile into the limo, excitedly talking.
ANNIE Ok, everyone just get in the car.
ANNIE Got a ride to the hotel.
ANNIE It's taken care of.
MEGAN (from inside the limo) Sit by me, Annie!
The girls' excited talking continues into the lobby.
LILLIAN This hotel is amazing!
LILLIAN You guys!
HELEN Come on Lillian, you're staying with me in the master suite.
HELEN It's all set.
LILLIAN Oh!
LILLIAN Okay!
LILLIAN Then party in room 812 in one hour!
Girls get off the elevator, giddy with excitement.
Annie gets back into the elevator.
ANNIE Uh!
ANNIE Shoot!
ANNIE I left my sunglasses downstairs.
ANNIE Ugh!
ANNIE Where's my head?
Annie sneaks out, rolling her bag.
She catches a cab.
Cab pulls up to a tiny broken down building.
A sign reads a??Hotel Rick.
Vacancy.
Some T.V.s.a?? An old man rides a bicycle in circles in the parking lot, smiling.
Lobby is very outdated.
Wood panel walls etc., The hotel brochure is on the desk.
It is probably the picture she saw online, it does NOT look the same.
The clerk enters.
ANNIE Hi, I have a reservation for Walker.
ANNIE RICK, an East Indian man, stands behind the desk in front of a large portrait of himself, posed exactly as he is now, with the same outfit.
ANNIE He holds the pose, smiling.
RICK Okay, two nights?
ANNIE Yes.
ANNIE Rick waits for her to notice the painting, but she never does.
RICK Do you want towels?
ANNIE Yes.
RICK Do you need sheets?
ANNIE Yes.
RICK No pillow though, ok?
RICK Annie just stares at him.
INT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES The door opens to reveal a gorgeous huge feminine suite.
(gasp) OH MY GOD!
Annie opens her door holding unfolded sheets and towels.
The room is very ugly, bare mattress, lots of brown.
ANNIE Oh my God.
INT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES Megan and Leslie stand in their grande bathroom.
INT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES Hot tub, plush towels, flat screen T.V. Candles burning.
MEGAN Oh my gosh, I can't believe this.
LESLIE He-llo Vegas!
There's an old toothbrush and comb by the dirty sink, a pair of athletic socks hanging over the shower rod where a curtain should be.
There is a cat staring at her.
ANNIE Hello cat.
INT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES Dana and Becca open their curtains revealing a spectacular view.
INT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES They scream and jump up and down.
Annie opens up her curtains to a back lot.
Something is on fire!
Rick tries to put it out.
The old man rides by.
Annie stands outside room 312.
She is dressed more preppy than she's ever looked.
She knocks on the door.
Becca opens it.
We see disco lights and hear rap music.
There are shirtless male waiters, penis balloons and a slide show of naked men.
The room looks like a sex club.
The girls are dressed like borderline prostitutes.
BECCA Oooh, Annie's here!
Wooooooh!
BECCA Isn't this amazing?
BECCA Lillian runs over and hugs Annie, wearing a condom veil and drinking out of a penis straw.
LILLIAN Annie!
LILLIAN I wanna see a drink in your hand in one minute!
LILLIAN Lillian pulls Annie into the room.
LILLIAN Helen is getting off of the phone.
HELEN Ok you guys, change of plans.
HELEN The Velour Cobra had an opening at 9 so I got us a dinner reservation.
HELEN Isn't that radical?
Woohooo/Ooooh/Alright!
ANNIE Oh.

ANNIE Alright Everyone raises their glasses.
ANNIE The night has begun.
Annie is concentrating on the bill.

ANNIE Becca scoots in next to her.
BECCA Annie, I didn't get a chance to ask you, how was your date with Mike?
BECCA Give me all the details.
ANNIE Oh, um, we had dinner.
BECCA Do you think you'll go out with him again?
BECCA He told Kevin he thought you were really great and hot.
LESLIE (from her end of the table) Hey wha's the damage down there?
ANNIE Oh, I got it right here, I figured out what I owe so, should I just pass it around?
Why don't we just all split it?
It's so much easier.
Yeah/Just split it/Who cares?
ANNIE Yeah, it's probably just easier...just split it.
MEGAN Here, let me see it.
MEGAN Ok..
MEGAN .It's a hundred each plus tip.
ANNIE (sotto) I had soup and ice water.
MEGAN Plus we're paying for Lillian...everyone just put $125.
ANNIE (sotto) No alcohol...or any real food.
BECCA It'll all even out by the end of the night.
ANNIE How does it even out?
ANNIE How does that happen?
ANNIE Everyone, including Annie, puts in their money.
ANNIE Helen moves over to Annie.
LILLIAN Thank you everybody!!
HELEN Annie, don't tell Lillian, it's a surprise.
HELEN (CONT'D) My friend Sean Michael works for a promotional company and they're having this big event tonight at Tara Rei's stepbrother's Club, Sacrifice.
ANNIE Really?!
HELEN I think it should be our first stop.
HELEN H's reserving seats for us in the VIP section.
HELEN It's a $150 cover and there's a one bottle champagne minimum of $750 per table, he said people from the Real World go in there all the time.
ANNIE I thought we were going to the Jungle Lounge after this.
HELEN We are.
HELEN After that.
ANNIE Oh...um...wow.
ANNIE Awesome.
ANNIE Here's the thing I was going to stop by the hotel, the Marquis Suites.

LILLIAN Ok, Leslie spilled the beans.

LILLIAN What are we waiting for?
LILLIAN Wooooooo!
LILLIAN Lillian looks at Helen's legs.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Whoa whoa.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Helen, turn around.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Are those those Ransom Jeans?
HELEN Don't tell Perry I bought them,I ordered them from New York.
HELEN They're insanely expensive.
HELEN But I gotta tell you guys the compliments I get on my ass make them worth every penny.
HELEN She sticks her butt out.
HELEN Lillian slaps it and all the girls laugh.
HELEN She is the life of the party.
A party bus pulls up.
As the doors open, dry ice pours out.
Inside there's a disco ball, dance poles, crazy lights.
The girls all scream and run onto the bus.
With the commotion, no one notices that Annie stays behind.
Annie enters casino alone, sadly weaves through the slot machines.
a??My Prerogativea?? by Bobby Brown comes on VERY LOUD making conversation difficult.
Lillian looks around for Annie.
LILLIAN Oh my God, Annie our song!
LILLIAN Wher's Annie?
DANA What?!
LILLIAN Where's Annie?!

HELEN (to the other girls]
They continue partying, drinking, dancing.
Annie passes four fun college age party guys at a craps table.

ANNIE Oh, Ok.
As the cab drives away, we hear:
BRIAN 1 Dude, we gotta get Brian some food asap.
BRIAN 1 I've seen that look before.
Everyone eats huge burgers including the driver (not Annie, she is annoyed!)
ANNIE You guys almost done?
BRIAN 2 Sorry we haven't eaten all day.
I have NEVER seen a drive-thru line like that dude.
CAB DRIVER It's because of the concert.

Annie walks through the club.
She calls Lillian.
No answer.
She gets a a drink.
Time passes.
Her phone rings!
LILLIAN Annie!
ANNIE Hello!?
LILLIAN Are you ok?
ANNIE Yeah, I'm fine.
ANNIE I'm here!
ANNIE Where are you?!
LILLIAN What do you mean here, where?

ANNIE The club!
LILLIAN Listen I can't hear you!
LILLIAN We had to leave the Jungle Lounge, Becca--
ANNIE What?!
LILLIAN Meet us at the--
ANNIE Hello?!!
Loud music.
Lillian tries to call Annie back.
Annie tries to call Lillian back.
They both get voice-mails.
Annie gives up.
It starts pouring rain on her inside the club.
Everyone jumps up and screams with excitement.
Thunder!
Me Tarzan, you Jane.
It's time for the dance spotlight.
If it lands on you, you gotta shake it!
The spotlight immediately lands on a soaking wet Annie.
She dances very angrily.
Jungle dancers dance very close to her and put vines around her neck.
Annie walks in.
GUYS Yeah, she's back/ the Roller!/ Yeah!
DAVE What happened to you?
ANNIE I don't even know.
DAVE Roller, I can't stand seeing you like this.
DAVE (to bartender] Get this fine lady a shot!
ANNIE I'll have two lemon drops.
Annie and Dave are wasted.
ANNIE That's what I'm saying.
ANNIE Some people have everything and others have just little bits of things.
ANNIE It's not fair.
ANNIE I don't get it.....I mean I think I hate Helen.
DAVE I hate Helen.
ANNIE That is the sexiest think anyon's ever said.
In the dark, Annie and Dave are passionately making out.
Knocking things over, etc.
DAVE I hate Helen.
The cat jumps on the bed and meows.
Annie opens her eyes to see Dave sleeping.
She notices his college tattoo on his arm (tasmanian devil with a lacrosse stick?).
DAVE Hey.
ANNIE Hi.
ANNIE Sorry I fell asleep while we were making out.
ANNIE I guess I was pretty tired.
DAVE Its ok.
DAVE Sorry I gave you a hickey.
ANNIE Oh shit.
ANNIE There's a knock at the door.
ANNIE Annie opens it to reveal NICOLE, (20), pretty and sweet.
NICOLE Is Dave here?
DAVE Nicole!?
DAVE Hey, Nic.
NICOLE This is a surprise.
Brian 1, Brian 2 and Mark appear in the doorway as well.
BRIAN 1 Dude, I'm sorry.
BRIAN 1 She made us bring her here.
MARK She said you have her fake I.D..
NICOLE Yeah and I couldn't go anywhere last night.
NICOLE I tried calling you fifty fucking times.
NICOLE And YOU?
NICOLE You were what, hooking up with this fossil?!
ANNIE First of all-
NICOLE Shut the fuck up or I will kick your ass bitch.
ANNIE Ok, that is not nice.
NICOLE And what are you forty?
ANNIE No, I'm in my low thirties...(under her breath) and you could never kick my ass.
NICOLE What did you say?!
ANNIE (timid) You heard me.
ANNIE Annie immediately gets punched in the face.
ANNIE Annie is shocked and swings back, hitting Nicole in the face.
ANNIE She's proud of herself.
ANNIE Nicole's two friends enter and jump on Annie.
ANNIE HUGE GIRL FIGHT.
Annie is outside of the hotel.
Guys are pulling the girls off of Annie.
NICOLE Baker Community College bitch!
The girls leave in victory.
Dave turns and mouths to Annie a??I'm sorry.a??
She frantically tries to cover up her HUGE hickey and evidence of the fight, with make-up.
She remembers a small cowboy print tablecloth from the other room and wraps it around her neck like a scarf.
All the girls are hung over and eating.
Annie arrives.
MEGAN Annie!
LILLIAN Whoa.
LILLIAN What are you, going to a rodeo?
ANNIE That's hilarious.
MEGAN Annie, you missed it.
MEGAN I scammed all night last night.
MEGAN I met this guy named Darwin.
MEGAN He works for Cingular.
MEGAN He had a friend.
LESLIE What happened to your face?
LILLIAN Yeah, why are you wearing all that makeup?
ANNIE It's covering up bruises, cuts and a hickey.
ANNIE I got into fight with a community college student and her friends because I spent the night with her boyfriend after spending the entire night trying to find you.
LILLIAN What?!
ANNIE Forget it.
LILLIAN I was trying to find YOU.
LILLIAN I tried to call you all night!
ANNIE Well, I-(to Lil} Can I talk to you for a minute?
ANNIE Annie takes Lillian away.
LILLIAN What is going on?
LILLIAN You told Helen you were sick.
ANNIE I wasn't sick.
ANNIE Helen told you that because...
ANNIE I couldn't afford to go with you guys.
LILLIAN Why didn't you say something?--
HELEN Lillian, we're going to be late for our honey facials.
ANNIE Helen, can you just give us a minute?
HELEN I'm just saying, we're gonna be late.
HELEN I don't wanna be rude.
ANNIE That's funny.
ANNIE You know what?
ANNIE As the Maid of honor, which is what I am and what you are not, I am asking you to just give us a minute.
HELEN Excuse me Annie.
ANNIE No, excuse me!
LILLIAN Annie take it easy.
ANNIE I need to take it easy?
DANA Annie, if it makes you feel any better (getting emotional] I got slapped last night.
LESLIE Here we go...
DANA By this huge girl.
DANA She was a working in the bathroom.
DANA I just...
DANA I didn't cut in line.
DANA I didn't!
DANA She chased me!
BECCA Becca it's over.
MEGAN Annie, she looked like Popeye.
BECCA She lives here!
BECCA She lives in Vegas.
HELEN You're not going to run into her.
HELEN Just shut-up about it.
LILLIAN Guys stop!
LILLIAN Please!
LILLIAN Annie, I'm so sorry about last night.
LILLIAN I feel horrible.
LILLIAN I want to hear everything that happened.
LILLIAN Tonight, you're not leaving my side.
LILLIAN We're hittin' the strip club all of us and we're going to put this shit behind us.
LILLIAN Okay?!
LILLIAN The girls agree.
LILLIAN Dana rubs her arm.
LESLIE Oh your arm does not still hurt.
Bridesmaids window shop.
Something in a fancy boutique catches Annie's eye, she smiles.
Ransom jeans.
The ladies sit at the front row tables.
What can I get you ladies?
ANNIE First of all , we're gonna need some ones over here.
ANNIE Here's a hundred.
ANNIE Keep twenty for yourself.
LILLIAN Oooh, Ann!
LILLIAN A siren goes off.
V.O. Good evening ladies, and welcome to Thunderbird.
V.O. Our first male entertainer has been roaming the prairie for many, many lonely nights...
V.O. A horse winnies.
V.O. Ladies scream.
V.O. (CONT'D) Here he is...looking for a sweet lady to keep him company under the stars...say hello to Cowboy Ron!
V.O. (CONT'D) A male stripper comes out on a cardboard horse, humping
'S looking for someone.
'S The room goes wild.
V.O. (CONT'D) There he is ladies looking for that special woman, looking for his briiide...And I believe the person he's looking for is Lillian Donovan!
V.O. (CONT'D) The girls scream.
V.O. (CONT'D) Lillian mouths to Annie a??I'm gonna kill you.a?? Cowboy Ron takes her up on stage.
V.O. (CONT'D) He puts her in a chair and humps her face.
V.O. (CONT'D) Everyone is cracking up.
MEGAN Leslie, your missing it.
LESLIE Don't talk to me.
LESLIE Nobody talk to me.
LESLIE Leslie has her hands on the bare ass of a stripper who is dancing in her face.
LESLIE Stripper #2 appears.
V.O. Wow, looks like Cowboy Ron has a friend on the prairie and he's lookin' for a lady too.
LILLIAN (pointing to Annie) Get her!
LILLIAN Get her!!
Stripper #2 pulls Annie up to the stage, lays her on the ground and simulates sex with her.
Standing above her, pulls his chaps off.
We see that his balls are not all the way tucked into his g-string.
The girls cringe.
As he stands above her, in slow motion, we see a bead of sweat leave his balls and fly into Anni's open laughing mouth.
She dry heaves.
The stripper is oblivious, goes to another girl.
Lillian and Annie roll around on the ground laughing.
Everyone's laughing as they exit the club.
ANNIE I need some gum.
BECCA That was disgusting!
BECCA I'm so glad I'm married.
MEGAN It was awesome!
DANA I got a picture of the balls.
DANA I got it!
LESLIE (puts her arm around Annie).
LESLIE You lucky bitch.
LILLIAN Only you Annie.
LILLIAN Hands down, best moment of the weekend.
LILLIAN Annie finally feels a part of the group.
Annie walks to first class, everyon's sleeping.
She hears Lillian laughing really hard, pointing at pictures in a magazine.
LILLIAN Oh look, there's your boyfriend.
HELEN Ew, he's like 65.
HELEN Ok, look Lillian that's you.
LILLIAN Oh my God.
LILLIAN You know who that actually looks like?
LILLIAN Remember when we went to Miami and we had to rent towels--
HELEN Ew, at that beach, that weird beach!
LILLIAN And that lady came up to us wearing that mesh top!
HELEN She was crazy.
HELEN Annie sinks.
HELEN A flight attendant appears.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Excuse me.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Hi.
ANNIE Hi.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT I'm sorry, you can't be up here.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT You have to go back to coach.
ANNIE I was just stretching my legs.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT That's not true.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Annie stares at her.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT The flight attendant holds out her hand for Annie to grab.
Come on...it's ok, c'mon.
C'mon.
ATTENDANT Ok, that's going to be seventy -five dollars.
ANNIE What?
ATTENDANT Twenty-five dollars a day.
ATTENDANT Three days.
ATTENDANT Seventy -five dollars.
ANNIE I thought it was seven.
ATTENDANT Oh, hmm mm.
ATTENDANT That's for this lot, you parked in this lot.
ATTENDANT The lots are exactly the same, separated by a white line.
ATTENDANT Annie empties her wallet, her poker winnings are gone.
Annie is driving.
She sees Rhodes, and stops.
RHODES Oh, I know what's going on.
RHODES You're jealous of that Helen girl.
ANNIE Excuse me?
ANNIE No, I'm not.
RHODES If you say so.
ANNIE I'm telling you I am not jealous of Helen, okay?
ANNIE She's tall and thin and rich and pretty.
ANNIE They both laugh.
RHODES Oh come on, you know you got it goin' on...
ANNIE Oh yeah, I got it goin' on...
RHODES You're right, you don't.
ANNIE (laughing) Thanks a lot.
ANNIE They nudge each other.
ANNIE He accidentally nudges her off the car.
RHODES Sorry!
RHODES Now Annie is back in her running car.
ANNIE Have a good rest of your shift.
RHODES Actually, I'm heading home.
RHODES Got my sister staying with me for a few days.
RHODES Sh's been thinking of divorcing of her husband.
ANNIE Oh.
ANNIE Sorry.
RHODES He had an affair and they've got kids so it's complicated.
ANNIE Hmm.
ANNIE Sounds familiar.
RHODES My sister is a hell of a woman, you know?
RHODES And her husband is- you know what I think cheating is?
RHODES It's weak.
RHODES It's a weak person that cheats.
RHODES Something clicks with Annie, she sees him in a new light.
ANNIE No, no.
ANNIE Um, I feel the same way.
ANNIE Um, anyway um, maybe I'll drive by you next week.
ANNIE I have to make this drive again...so...
ANNIE She tries to flirt a little, pulls her hair back.
ANNIE He sees her hickey!!!!
ANNIE She starts itching her arm, still flirting and laughing.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Ugh, great, I think I was allergic to the soap at the hotel.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Ahhhhh.
RHODES Yeah.
RHODES I should go..now.
RHODES Don't forget to call my friend about those tail lights.
RHODES They're really starting to bug me.
ANNIE I promise.
ANNIE Ok, well, have a good weekend.
RHODES You too.
RHODES He abruptly walks back to his car.
RHODES She drives away confused.
Annie arrives home to another a??moma?? package.
She pulls out some cheap cosmetics.
She pulls out a bottle of White Diamonds perfume by Elizabeth Taylor, low calorie mints, some pepper spray, a book titled a??100 Survival tips For the Independent Woman.a?? A check for $25.
She opens the book, sees chapters entitled a??You Don't Have to Work for AAA to Change a Tire.a?? a?? How to Jack a CarJacker.a?? a??Anyone with Arms Can Skin a Deera?? etc.
She tries to read but the itching is driving her crazy.
Annie's on the table while the DOCTOR examines her skin.
DOCTOR Well, I've got good news for you.
DOCTOR You're going to live.
DOCTOR Hahahah.
DOCTOR It's not an allergic reaction though.
ANNIE Oh, that's good.
DOCTOR You've got body lice.
ANNIE Oh.
DOCTOR Have you recently come in contact with or slept anywhere that you think you might
ANNIE I know where I got it.
DOCTOR You're gonna have to wash every fabric in your apartment and I'll give you a topical cream that should knock it out pretty quick.
DOCTOR I've got some samples.
Annie sits on the doorstep.
Lillian runs up with a bunch of stuff in her arms and opens the door.
They enter the apartment.
LILLIAN I'm so sorry.
LILLIAN I was at our travel agen's trying to figure out how to get my da's family out here, they all have to fly at different times, uggh.
LILLIAN What's that on your arms?
LILLIAN She sees some of Annie's lice medicine motion.
ANNIE Huh?
ANNIE Oh...I did a face mask.
ANNIE I must have gotten some on me and didn't rinse it.
LILLIAN Oh shit, I'm sorry, I have to check one thing really quick.
LILLIAN When is my hair consultation?
LILLIAN Lillian frantically looks through her calender.
ANNIE Listen, I want to talk to you about--
LILLIAN Oh no.
ANNIE What's wrong?
LILLIAN I knew it.
LILLIAN I'm going to have my period on my wedding day...and my honeymoon!
ANNIE It's ok.
ANNIE I mean it's not like it's your first time doing it.
LILLIAN It's our wedding night though!
ANNIE You can still have sex, just put a towel down in the bed.
LILLIAN I can't believe this.
LILLIAN This sucks.
LILLIAN (beat) Oh, Annie I wanted to ask you.
LILLIAN Do you think for the cocktail party before the reception we should have a string trio or a horn trio?
Can you just realize what you just asked me right now?
LILLIAN What?
ANNIE You just said a string trio or horn trio.
ANNIE I thought you didn't want anything fancy, you know, just a??keep it simple.a?? a??Not a big deal.a??
LILLIAN I know but now that I'm planning everything it's just...I wanna do it right.
LILLIAN It's once in a life time.
LILLIAN It's my wedding.
LILLIAN Lillian's phone rings.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Ugh!
LILLIAN (CONT'D) It's Dougie's Mom.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) She's mad at me because I won't let her invite everyone from her work.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Oh!
LILLIAN (CONT'D) That reminds me.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) If you're not going to bring anybody, will you let me know?
LILLIAN (CONT'D) I gotta free up some spots.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) (into phone] Hello?
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Lillian walks away with the phone.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Annie is speechless.
Dryer is going.
Annie is sorting a huge pile of sheets, towels, etc.
Her cell phone rings.
ANNIE Helen.
HELEN Annie?
HELEN Where are you?
HELEN Inside a truck?
ANNIE No, I'm doing laundry, what's up?
HELEN Annie, the shower needs to happen soon.
HELEN We haven't heard from you and everyone is-
ANNIE I know.
ANNIE I know.
ANNIE I'm trying to--
HELEN Annie can I dialog openly with you?
HELEN I know you're having some financial trouble and I think it would be best if I did the shower.
HELEN Now before you say anything, let me say that showers can be very expensive and I think what's important here is what's best for Lillian.
ANNIE Wow.
HELEN You don't have to give me an answer now
ANNIE You should have it.
ANNIE You should have it.
HELEN Great.
HELEN Well, I'll definitely need some help.
ANNIE Ok?
HELEN Could you bring the cookies?
HELEN Annie hangs up, looks at her laundry piles.
HELEN Pissed.
Annie behind her counter.
GIRL Excuse me!!
GIRL A snotty thirteen year old, valley-type, rich girl stands at Annie's counter with an iced coffee chewing gum.
I'm looking for a birthday gift for my best friend.
ANNIE Your best friend?
GIRL Yeah.
ANNIE For now.
GIRL (sip] What do you mean?
ANNIE Well, what's gonna happen when you get older?
ANNIE Did you ever think of that?
ANNIE What about when she makes new friends and they're more successful than you are?
ANNIE Girl stares annoyingly, chewing and sipping.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Huh?
ANNIE (CONT'D) And they buy her facials and designer dresses for cheap and yo're stuck selling jewelry to teenagers wh's outfit cost more than your rent?
GIRL Ummm....you're weird.
ANNIE You're stupid.
GIRL You have no chin.
ANNIE You're gonna be a slut in high school.
GIRL You are an old, single loser who has no friends, works in a jewelry store, colors her own hair, and will never know the feeling of owning a luxury car.
She sips in victory, slurps up the last drop noisily.
ANNIE (quietly] You.
ANNIE Little.
ANNIE Cunt.
ANNIE The girls eyes widen.
ANNIE The camera pans to show that the girl's dad and Donna have been there the whole time.
Donna stands across from Annie wh's cleaning out her locker.
She sadly starts to leave.
ANNIE Bye.
DONNA You know, I knew a girl once.
DONNA Karen Stippleton.
DONNA She was really something.
DONNA The life of the party, a concert pianist, she had naturally curly hair, and skin black as night.
DONNA But one evening at a dinner party I walked in on her in the bathroom putting a vile of cocaine up her buttocks and last I heard, she was playing the saxophone outside of a drug store.
DONNA And I'm gonna say something to you I should have told her.
DONNA Don't waste your life.
DONNA Find out what your gifts are and use them.
DONNA Donna hugs Annie, then leaves her in the break room.
Annie arrives completely depressed.
Outside her doorstep is yet another package.
Annie takes it inside.
STEVE Ooh, another package from your mom?
ANNIE Yep.
ANNIE It is a beautiful pink and white striped box with her name and address in calligraphy.
ANNIE When Annie opens the lid, a??Canon in Da?? plays and a real butterfly flies out.
She reads, a??A Shower for Lillian.a?? Steve comes over to see.
On one side of the box, there is a beautiful sculpture of Lillian and Dougie as Bride and Groom, a candle with Lillian's face printed on it and some chocolates.
Annie takes the invitation out, opens it quickly.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Are you kidding me?
The invitation reads:

I- Annie hangs up quickly.
Annie's relaxation CD is playing as she lies talking on the phone to her Mom, who is painting a very life-like picture of Enrique Iglesias in concert.
JUDY Is there an animal over there?
ANNIE No, it's a C.D.
ANNIE She rolls over and turns it off.
JUDY So, I'm flying straight to O'Hare the day of the shower cause I wanna get my hair done.
JUDY Did you see that invitation?
JUDY I didn't get the significance of the dead butterfly, but it looks like w're gonna have fun.
ANNIE I'm not.
JUDY Oh, c'mon.
ANNIE I already know what it's gonna be like.
ANNIE It's gonna be uncomfortable and weird...I don't wanna go.
JUDY Sweetie, listen to yourself.
JUDY You ca't let her new friends get in the way of your being a part of one of the best days of Lil's life.
JUDY NO way.
JUDY You have a history with her that no one else has.
JUDY So you walk into that party knowing that.
Annie drives to Helen's.
She sees a pink and white highway sign (that looks like a traditional highway exit sign) a??Lillian's Shower Rue.
This exita??
ANNIE Oh my God.
ANNIE She turns into the gates of a??Whitewater Estates.a?? There is, a life-size sculpture of a bride and groom.
ANNIE As she gets closer, she sees they are real life models.
ANNIE They smile at Annie, wink at her and wave her by.
ANNIE At the next stop sign, a butler appears with a tray.
BUTLER Are you a guest of Helen Harris?
ANNIE Yes.
BUTLER The shower is one mile away.
BUTLER He hands her a pink lemonade.
ANNIE I don't have a cup-holder.
ANNIE As she's driving, little pink things start to fly beside her car.
One flies in her car.
They're Rose petals!
Annie's shitty car drives down a road covered with Rose petals.
At the driveway, she is greeted by a valet in a pink bow-tie and beret.
As she reaches for her gift from the passenger seat, another valet opens that door and take it.
This will be placed in the gift room for you madame.
He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him.
ANNIE I'll take those.
Annie watches the valet drives her car away.
When she turns back around, there is a man with a white horse holding out his hand to her.
Would you like an assisted ride to the main house?
ANNIE Do I have to?
ANNIE An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies.
ANNIE She dismounts.
ANNIE The front door is swung open by two attendants.
ANNIE As she enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her...

MEGAN They're dogs!
ANNIE What?
MEGAN Yeah.
MEGAN And they're wrapped up like presents.
MEGAN They said we have to wait until we leave but I cant stop thinking about them.
MEGAN I gotta go tell Lillian.
Annie now stands next to the chocolate fountain.
She looks around, drops her glass in it and unplugs it with her foot.
It stops flowing.
She looks around and throws some leaves in it and walks away.
'S attention by microphone.

JUDY The shower is a hit.
Everyone sits surrounded by decorations, pictures of Dougie and Lillian as babies, flowers, fire in the fireplace.
DANA Everyone it's game time!
DANA Please take your piece of paper, put it on top of your head, and with your other hand try to draw what Lillian and Dougie's first baby is going to look like!!!

ANNIE It's none of my business.
ANNIE She's gross.

Dana cries and takes a picture.
Everyone applauds,
ANNIE (to person near her) The ocean's are really polluted right now.
ANNIE Its not something to joke about.
Lillian opens presents in front of huge photograph of herself.
LILLIAN Oh!

ANNIE Annie marches into the back yard.
ANNIE (CONT'D) (shouting, we see her through the large
Did you honestly think 30 women were gonna finish this?!
You know what!?
'll help you out!
She tries to take down the cookie and struggles with it.
We watch her from the house.
Fall over with the cookie, she runs over to the chocolate fountain and tries to tip it over, it's obviously too heavy.
She tries to empty it with her hands onto the ground.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Mmmmm.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Nothing says friendship like a thousand gallons of hot unsanitary chocolate!
ANNIE (CONT'D) Hello swan, are you having fun?
ANNIE (CONT'D) Did you enjoy the hip-hop dancers?
Everyone is watching Annie.
She is fighting and punching the air like a crazy person, chasing a swan.
A little girl starts crying.
Annie walks back through the house, through the crowd holding her chocolate covered hands in the air.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I actually thought I wanted to be like you...and you and YOU, to be a part of this world.
ANNIE (CONT'D) That's not who I am.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I make bad choices.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I'm broke, I lost my stupid job, I'm thirty two years old and I still answer booty calls.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I don't like Mike Donahue cause he () on our date.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I have a single black hair that grows out of my chin and I can't wear white t-shirts cause something about my sweat turns the pits yellow!
ANNIE (CONT'D) AND you know when we were in Vegas?
ANNIE (CONT'D) When you were all staying at your luxury hotel?
ANNIE (CONT'D) I was staying at Hotel RICK where got BODY LICE!
ANNIE (CONT'D) So Helen, you can have the coveted Maid of Honor title.
ANNIE (CONT'D) You can have it all wrapped up in a big pink obnoxious musical box!

ANNIE (CONT'D) Congratulations!
ANNIE (CONT'D) Annie leaves and Lillian runs after her.
LILLIAN Annie stop!
LILLIAN I don't know what's going on.
ANNIE Well let me fill you in.
ANNIE Ever since you got engaged, my life has turned to shit.
LILLIAN I'm sorry the the happiest time in my life has brought you so much misery.
LILLIAN Do you know how selfish that sounds?
ANNIE I'm selfish?
ANNIE You're the one that's been so wrapped up in all this.
ANNIE Designer dressed, extravagant hotels, this shower, this is not you!
LILLIAN This is my wedding and you've made it all about you.
ANNIE Well at least my friendship's not for sale.
ANNIE This hangs in the air.
ANNIE Annie storms off.
ANNIE Lillian storms back inside.
HELEN Do you think she still has body lice?

Annie is pissed.
She sees a squirrel in the road (close up of squirrels big eyes).
She tries to avoid it, slams on her breaks and BOOM!
Annie is rear-ended!
The driver behind her backs up, peels out and drives away.
ANNIE Thank you!
ANNIE Her car won't start.
ANNIE Trying to keep it together, she grabs her running shoes from the back seat and storms down the highway, trying not to cry.
ANNIE A cop car pulls next to her.
ANNIE I's Rhodes.
Rhodes is looking under her hood.
RHODES Well, I can't say I'm surprised.
ANNIE Yes.
ANNIE Taillights.
ANNIE I know!
RHODES You should've taken it to my friend-

RHODES Annie starts to walk away.

RHODES (CONT'D) Annie keeps walking.
RHODES (CONT'D) Oh, you're going to walk fifteen miles?!
RHODES (CONT'D) Another WISE decision!
What do you know?!!
RHODES I know that you not taking responsibility is why we're standing out here!
RHODES YOU did not make an effort to fix that problem.
RHODES This hits Annie.
RHODES Rhodes is physically worked up.
ANNIE Why are you yelling at me?!
RHODES It's dangerous!
RHODES You're putting your life, and others in danger!
ANNIE I'm!
ANNIE Sorry!
ANNIE He calms down.
RHODES Look, all I know, is that you're kinda crazy.
RHODES You're always stressed out or late, complaining about something, and now you're yelling at me!
RHODES And for some reason, all I've ever wanted to do is ask you on a date.
ANNIE Well save yourself the trouble, and don't.
RHODES Yeah, I'm not much of a hickey guy anyway.
RHODES Annie remembers her hickey.
RHODES He saw it?!
ANNIE Well, I have said a??noa?? anyway.
RHODES Well, then you have yourself a good night ma'am.
RHODES Annie regrets that.
RHODES He drives away leaving her there.
RHODES She is alone.
Annie's car gets towed into the shop.
BILL enters with a clip board.
He is a stocky Milwaukee good guy.
BILL Rhodes told me a while back you might be stopping in.
BILL I'm Bill Cozbi.
ANNIE Oh, hi.
BILL I was beginning to think we'd never see ya.
ANNIE Yeah, I know.
ANNIE I'm irresponsible.
BILL Nah, no one likes taking care of that stuff.
BILL But you are going to have to leave your car here for a week or so.
ANNIE A week?
STEVE So you kind of had a bad time at the wedding shower?
ANNIE Yes I did.
ANNIE Everything's just...
ANNIE She starts crying.
ANNIE Steve hands her a tissue from the middle console.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I'm sorry, I just--this has been a really shitty day.
STEVE Yeah.
STEVE Ok, don't get mad at me, but it seems like you have a lot of those.
ANNIE Yes I do!
ANNIE Right?
ANNIE Thank you.
STEVE Have you considered the idea that maybe, possibly, perhaps, it's you that makes them shitty?
STEVE Annie stares at him.
STEVE (CONT'D) I'm just saying, maybe it's your attitude.
ANNIE This is not about attitude.
ANNIE It's just the facts!
ANNIE My life hasn't turned it out the way I expected.
ANNIE I don't have any of those things that gives a person points in the world.
STEVE I think that might be your problem.
STEVE I think you read too many of those magazines.
STEVE You don't need things to be someone.
STEVE Tyra said that.
STEVE Tyra Banks.
Annie sits on the couch with Steve in a daze, watching
'S Lillian.
'S She doesn't even know what to say, so she doesn't answer.
Annie reads a shitty magazine at the counter.
She turns to see the gray-haired, outdoorsy WOMAN that she and Lillian pointed out.
WOMAN Is anyone sitting here?
ANNIE No.
ANNIE The lady sits next to Annie and smiles at her.
Annie looks in the classifieds.
A lot say a??college degree required.a?? She looks up and sees TED has walked in.
TED Hey Annie.
ANNIE Oh, hey Ted.
ANNIE You're in town.
TED Yeah, yeah.
TED Listen I'm going out tonight but I should be home around 11, you wanna come over?
ANNIE Really?
ANNIE Ok, sure.
ANNIE Ted smiles at her.
ANNIE Annie stops herself.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Wait no.
ANNIE (CONT'D) No.
ANNIE (CONT'D) No.
ANNIE (CONT'D) I don't think I do.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Because answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of no-strings-attached sex doesn't feel good.
ANNIE (CONT'D) NO girls feel good after that and if they say they do they're LYING.
ANNIE (CONT'D) But it's not your fault.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Its me.
ANNIE (CONT'D) It's me.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Have a great life.
ANNIE (CONT'D) And you can keep the plant.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Annie grabs her stuff and leaves.
She lies on her bed staring at the ceiling.
She picks up the phone.
Lillian's phone lights up, it's on silent.
She is
'S names cut out and being placed at different tables.
'S Her mom, Laurie, Helen, and two women argue about the seating chart.

Annie smiles back.
ANNIE I won't be late.
TIM Oh and I wanna try one of those moonpies.
ANNIE (smiling] Yeah.
ANNIE Ok.
Annie weaves through the crowded hallway, approaches a window.
ANNIE Hi, I'm here to inquire about financial aid.
ANNIE Her cell phone rings.
ADMINISTRATION LADY Take these to the second window.
ANNIE I'm sorry?
ANNIE Annie's trying to find her phone.

BILL I owe him big time.
BILL He runs background checks on all the guys my daughter dates.
BILL There's been a lot of 'em.

ANNIE If you see him, would you thank him for me and tell him that I'm crazy and I'm sorry.
ANNIE He'll know what you mean.
Annie drives past Rhodes' at his post, flicking her brand new taillights.
He sees her, but does't respond.
pull her over.
She drives by him again and swerves all over the road.
He really wants to pull her over, but he doesn't.
She goes back one more time, throws a bunch of trash and diet coke cans out of the window.
He still ignores her.
She gives up and goes home.

LESLIE (CONT'D) Look, I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.

ANNIE Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me to fix this.
ANNIE They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do.
ANNIE Annie puts the jack under car.

DANA So what are you doing now?
ANNIE I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off.
BECCA How does that little thing lift the whole car?
MEGAN It uses hydraulic power.
MEGAN It gives a human being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to three tons.
LESLIE How do you know this stuff?
MEGAN I like cars.
MEGAN There's a real artistry to them.
HELEN Are you guys working or talking?
HELEN We do't have all night.
DANA (quickly) Annie is doing the best she can Helen.
DANA So why don't you just stand over there and be quiet and wait.
Everyone's speechless.
HELEN Excuse me?!
HELEN Dana stands.
HELEN She has had it with Helen.
DANA I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck up!!!??
DANA Dana approaches Helen.
DANA The other girls are standing now.
DANA (CONT'D) Lillian probably left because of you anyway.
HELEN What!?
DANA You're so- bossy!
DANA You've been acting like you're in charge this whole time!
DANA Do't you realize how much pressure sh's under?
DANA You know, Lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn carriage?!
DANA She said a??That's not me.a?? And you ordered it anyway!
DANA You've been pushing her this whole time!
DANA Annie was right.
MEGAN Yeah!
MEGAN Helen glares at Megan.
HELEN What are you talking about?
HELEN The only reason you're even in this wedding is because you're the groom's sister.
HELEN Weirdo.
MEGAN I'd rather be the groom's sister than have cameltoe from my $600 pants.
MEGAN We see that Helen has cameltoe.
MEGAN Megan has surprised them.
HELEN Why is everyone attacking me?
HELEN I wasn't the one who caused a huge scene at Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry.
Everyone looks at Annie.
LESLIE I hate to interrupt this riveting discussion but a really creepy guy in a Trans Am just pulled over.
LESLIE The guy gets out of the car.
LESLIE He is thirty-ish, wears at- shirt with a cat on it and camouflage shorts.
TRANS AM MAN Hey it's pretty late.
TRANS AM MAN What are you ladies doing?
TRANS AM MAN Becca and Dana scramble into the woods.
TRANS AM MAN Leslie gets behind the car.

ANNIE Nope I think we got it.

ANNIE He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other.
TRANS AM MAN Look, if you guys get tired, I live right up that hill.
TRANS AM MAN You ladies can just leave your car here, come on up and let us all lay down together.
TRANS AM MAN He starts to walk toward them.
TRANS AM MAN The girls are scared.
TRANS AM MAN Annie gives Megan a look.
TRANS AM MAN Megan tries to distract him.
MEGAN Hey!
MEGAN Are those snowflake rims?
MEGAN The guy looks at Megan.
TRANS AM MAN Yeah, found a??em in a junk yard.
TRANS AM MAN Restored a??em myself.
MEGAN I bet you got a formula 4OO under there?
TRANS AM MAN Well, well.
TRANS AM MAN Someone knows her cars.
MEGAN I'm in the Firebird club.
TRANS AM MAN You don't say.
TRANS AM MAN I never met a lady in the FBC before.
TRANS AM MAN He walks over to Megan, she gives Annie a nod.
TRANS AM MAN Annie rushes to the tire and quickly continues changing it.
MEGAN You ever make it up to the Trans Am Nationals in Dayton?
MEGAN Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together.
MEGAN They talk in a loud whisper.
BECCA What's happening?
BECCA What's happening?
DANA I can hear animals.
BECCA Be quiet!
BECCA The guy is moving closer to Megan.
MEGAN Remember Smokey and the Bandit?
TRANS AM MAN It's my favorite movie.
TRANS AM MAN a??Give me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper and make it quick .
TRANS AM MAN I'm in a goddamn hurry.a?? He leans into her.
MEGAN Why don't you show me what's under the hood?
MEGAN Back at Helen's car.
MEGAN Leslie sneaks over to Annie.
LESLIE How's it comin'?
ANNIE Almost there.
ANNIE The guy has lifted up his hood and Mega's looking.
ANNIE He puts his hands on her ass.
TRANS AM MAN You wanna get in the backseat?
MEGAN Uh...
MEGAN He is really getting aggressive, pushing against her.
MEGAN (CONT'D) Hey take it easy!
HELEN Hey what about me?
HELEN He turns around to be hit with a huge piece of wood by Helen.
HELEN He falls.
DANA Oh my God!!
DANA Annie is frantically releasing the jack.
ANNIE OK, everybody in the car!
ANNIE Get in!
ANNIE Megan, Helen let's go!
ANNIE All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it.
ANNIE Annie is finishing.
TRANS AM MAN Hey you!
HELEN Annie get in!
TRANS AM MAN I'm gonna get you bitches!!
TRANS AM MAN He is coming towards Annie!
TRANS AM MAN She turns towards him with the jack.
ANNIE Back away!
ANNIE Or I will shove this Jack so far down your throat you will shit out...your fucking..face!
TRANS AM MAN Whoa, whoa.
TRANS AM MAN Alright.
TRANS AM MAN Alright.
TRANS AM MAN I'm leaving.
ANNIE Get out!
TRANS AM MAN I am!
TRANS AM MAN I live up the hill though if you change your mind.
TRANS AM MAN Annie backs up and jumps in the car.
TRANS AM MAN Helen peels away.
TRANS AM MAN The girls drive away fast.
CONTINUOUS The girls still driving.
CONTINUOUS Megan's eating chips.
LESLIE Megan I was freaked out when he leaned up against you.
LESLIE That was a pretty gutsy move.
MEGAN Annie's the one who tried to make him eat a car jack.
ANNIE Helen hit him over the head with a tree.
ANNIE They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile.
ANNIE (CONT'D) There it is, turn left up here.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Go down the little hill.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Ok, that's the driveway.
ANNIE (CONT'D) It's dark and very rustic.
ANNIE (CONT'D) It's LILLIAN'S LAKE HOUSE FROM THE FLASHBACK.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Where Lillian and Dougie met.
LESLIE God I haven't been here in forever.
ANNIE The house is right up here.
ANNIE They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car.
HELEN Her car's not here.
DANA Doesn't look like any lights are on.
BECCA She's not here.
BECCA Annie is sitting on the front step, defeated.
ANNIE I thought she'd be here.
ANNIE I really thought she'd be here.
ANNIE I'm sorry.
DANA Annie, it's ok.
ANNIE No, it's not.
ANNIE I don't know what happened.
ANNIE I messed everything up.
ANNIE Lillia's not even talking to me.
ANNIE I think I'm so afraid to see what's really happening.
ANNIE Lillian's moving on to this great life and I feel left behind.
ANNIE And know matter how hard I try, I don't fit in to her life now.
ANNIE Everyone is silent.
HELEN Annie, Lillian loves you.
HELEN (beat] I know I haven't made things easy for you..
HELEN I don't have a life and I am bored.
HELEN Perry is always away and I'm constantly alone and she's been there.
HELEN And I've been a bridesmaid nine times and although I may have implied it, I....I've never been a Maid of Honor.
HELEN I wanted to make everything special for Lillian because...
HELEN I don't have a lot of friends.
HELEN I wanted her to like me better and to impress her, and everyone else.
HELEN And I'm just good at throwing parties.
HELEN I always have been.
HELEN In fact sometimes I think people only ask me to be in their wedding's because of that.
ANNIE Lillian wouldn't do that.
ANNIE If she asked you to be in her wedding it's because you are her friend.
ANNIE Trust me.
ANNIE Dana is crying and takes a picture.
ANNIE The're both startled by the flash.
HELEN I'm sorry about the Sea World tickets.
ANNIE I'm sorry that when I left the shower I told your neighbors you were shooting a porn.
HELEN Oh, I didn't know that you did that.
ANNIE Oh, well, sorry.
HELEN I deserved it.
ANNIE I must say you do put on some pretty spectacular events.
HELEN Well, I'm really rich.
HELEN They smile.
ANNIE It is getting pretty late.
DANA What should we do about Lillian?
ANNIE She'll come home when she's ready.
Annie enters exhausted to find Lillian sitting against her door.
Annie walks up and slides down to sit next to her.
After a minute.
ANNIE You okay?
LILLIAN Yeah.
LILLIAN Didn't mean to make anyone worry.
ANNIE It's okay.
ANNIE I really am sorry.
LILLIAN I'm sorry too.
LILLIAN I didnt want things to turn out like this.
LILLIAN I got so caught up in the frenzy of everything, wanting this one day to be perfect.
ANNIE Well its easy to get caught up.
LILLIAN And it doesnt help that all my friends hate eachother.
ANNIE I'm sorry.
ANNIE But it's all good now.
ANNIE We all talked and everythings cool.
HELEN Really?!
ANNIE Yup, Helen and I are best friends now.
ANNIE We're going shopping for cream sweaters tomorrow.
LILLIAN She's really not so bad.
ANNIE I know.
LILLIAN I just wish the wedding hadnt become about everything and everyone else but me and Dougie.
LILLIAN And now, it's become this thing I never wanted.
LILLIAN I did want simple.
LILLIAN I wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights and food everywhere.
LILLIAN I wanted a DJ to play all those stupid wedding songs.
ANNIE It's not too late to have those things.
LILLIAN I'm sorry I didn't know all the stuff you were going through too.
LILLIAN Annie is clearly sad.
ANNIE It's fine.
ANNIE I just feel really lost right
Lillian hugs her.
LILLIAN Nothing's going to change.
ANNIE Oh God dont say that.
LILLIAN I mean between you and me.
ANNIE You want to come in?
ANNIE Steve's home.
ANNIE This could be your last chance as a single woman.
LILLIAN Ooooo...
The small paper bag sits on the side of the road.
Cop car pulls up.
This is Rhodes' spot, we've seen before.
He gets out and walks over to it, confused.
He picks it up and it says, a??Officer Rhodesa??.
He's a little weary but opens it and pulls out a note.
a??I hear you like moonpies.a?? He looks in the bag and smiles.
Becca and Kevin are slow dancing happily very much in love.
Leslie and Paul dancing with two boys trying to join in.
They are all happy, he rubs her stomach.
Perry and Helen are dancing.
They look like they are talking and working things out.
He hugs her and kisses her.
Lillian and Dougie dance into frame.
They are very close.
Smiling and kissing.
They've never looked happier.
She smiles at someone.
It's Annie.
Annie is watching everyone from the side, smiling also.
Steve approaches.
STEVE Thanks a lot for bringing me.
ANNIE Thanks for coming with me.
ANNIE Megan appears on her other side.
MEGAN Yeah, thanks for bringing him.
Megan winks at Steve, he grabs her hand and they go to dance.
Annie is alone, watching everybody.
We see the wedding as a whole.
It's a beautiful event.
Colored lanterns, twinkly lights, food everywhere.
Simple, fun...very Lillian.
Annie and Lillian walking out of the reception.
LILLIAN So when does school start?
ANNIE A week.
ANNIE I'm scared.
ANNIE I'm gonna be the oldest one there.
LILLIAN So what?
LILLIAN Now you can have an affair with your teacher and it won't be gross.
LILLIAN They walk down the steps.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Thanks for everything today.
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Yo've been the best Maid of Honor ever.
ANNIE Really?
LILLIAN (kidding) MMM.
LILLIAN No.
LILLIAN That's not true at all.
LILLIAN You were pretty terrible.
LILLIAN Today you were good.
LILLIAN Annie sees the hotel shuttle.
ANNIE Oh, I want to catch this shuttle back to the hotel.
LILLIAN You're always gonna be my best friend.
LILLIAN They hug goodbye.
LILLIAN She runs down the stairs.
ANNIE I will see YOU in a couple weeks Mrs.
ANNIE Price!
Lillian waves goodbye and turns to go back inside.
Annie runs towards the shuttle.
She's too late.
The shuttle drives away without her.
She JUST missed it.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Wait!
ANNIE (CONT'D) Wait!
ANNIE (CONT'D) Stop!
ANNIE (CONT'D) Great.
ANNIE (CONT'D) Of course.
ANNIE (CONT'D) The shuttle is gone, but there's something that was on the other side of it.
RHODES (O.C.) Need a ride ma'am?
RHODES (O.C.) It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen candles.
RHODES (O.C.) Annie is all smiles and walks up to him.
ANNIE How did you know I was here?
RHODES It was really complicated.
RHODES I remembered the name of this place, I called them up, told them I was a cop calling on official police business, doing a very big investigation and uh, made them tell me all the weddings they had planned for the next two months with a bride named Lillian.
RHODES [ALT: I'm a cop] Annie smiles.
ANNIE Wow.
ANNIE They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
ANNIE (CONT'D) So, did you get the moonpies?
RHODES Yes I did.
ANNIE Did you like' em?
RHODES Yeah.
RHODES No.
RHODES I couldn't eat them.
RHODES They were completely covered in ants.
ANNIE Ooo, I didn't think about that.
RHODES You probably should have put it in a plastic wrap or maybe a foil or something.
RHODES Tupperware would've worked but then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm gonna kiss you right now so...
RHODES He walks to her and takes her in his arms.
RHODES They are about to kiss.
RHODES Rhodes stops.
I didn't want to miss my chance again.
Me neither.
They MAKE OUT.
The end.
Annie is walking back to her hotel.
A cop car pulls up next to her.
RHODES (O.C.) Need a ride ma'am?
RHODES (O.C.) She turns to see Rhodes driving slowly next to her.
ANNIE How did you know I was here?
RHODES I'm a cop.
RHODES They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
ANNIE So, did you get the moonpies?
RHODES Yes I did.
ANNIE Did you like' em?
RHODES Yeah.
RHODES No.
RHODES I couldn't eat them.
RHODES They were completely covered in ants.
ANNIE Ooo, I didn't think about that.
RHODES The real reason I came here today is that I have something that belongs to you.
RHODES He opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot.
RHODES She smiles.
RHODES He stops the car and unlocks the passenger door.
RHODES She gets in.
RHODES They drive off into the sunset.
