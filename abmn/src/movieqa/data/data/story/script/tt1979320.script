RUSH
Written by

December 6th, 2011
Dark clouds passing overhead.
The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in Germany), the past three days is on it's way out..
A pupil dilates and contracts in the light.
The eye stares.
Blinks.
Thinks.
Making evaluations..
The first rays of sunshine break through.
The voices of international TV commentators in different languages.
COMMENTATORS ...in places the track is still dangerously wet, but following a drivers meeting the decision has been taken.
COMMENTATORS The race is going ahead...
The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER wearing a fireproof balaclava...
Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion.
His name is painted on the side of his Ferrari.
NIKI LAUDA.
NIKI (V/O) My grandfather always said history is cruel and reductive and no matter how long we live, or how much we achieve - we are remembered for very little.
NIKI (V/O) So make sure it's the right things.
NIKI stares up at the clouds.
His eyelids flicker.
Thinking.
Agonizing.
Wrestling with an all important decision...
Is it going to carry on raining?
Or become dry?
Should he be using slicks or wets?
We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major Grand Prix.
All around us...
Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars.
An OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One Minute"...
Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.
NIKI This is bullshit.
NIKI We have no control over our legacy.
NIKI We cannot choose what we are remembered for...
A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...
MECHANIC Mass usa slicks.
MECHANIC Le vuoi cambiare anche tu?
MECHANIC (Mass is going on slicks.
MECHANIC You want to change?)
NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white helmet, number 12, several rows behind him.
A team of MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.
NIKI Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for my rivalry with this asshole.
NIKI And the 1976 season.
NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.
Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...
NIKI What about Hunt?
NIKI Has he changed?
MECHANIC No, he's going on wets.
The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews, mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..
The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but HUNT makes up for this with magnetism.
The rock star of F1.
NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava, flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..
NIKI I don't know why it became such a big thing.
NIKI We were just drivers.
NIKI Busting each other's balls.
NIKI To me this is perfectly normal.
NIKI But other people saw it differently.
NIKI (contid) That whatever it was between us went deeper.
NIKI (contid) And changed us both somehow.
NIKI (contid) Forever.
NIKI stares, then...
NIKI Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da bagnato.
The ten-second board is held up.
NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a split-second, eyes staring...
NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the engine.
The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000
NIKI Maybe that explains the state of mind I was in.
NIKI And why it happened.
NIKI The other thing I'm remembered for.
NIKI On August 1st, that same year...
CAPTION: "AUGUST 1st, 1976".
The STARTER waves the flag.
NIKI's foot hits the floor - his engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.
NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..
NIKI gets away first.
A good start!
But within seconds there's a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.
His arch-rival.
HUNT.
But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.
Number 12.
It's not Hunt.
It's MASS.
On his bald, slick tyres.
NIKI curses under his breath.
He screwed up.
Made the wrong decision.
Should have gone on slicks.
He urgently needs to change tyres...
NIKI swerves angrily into the pits.
Ferrari's pit is right at one end...
Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the pits to change to dry tyres.
It's chaos.
A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...
The Ferrari team frantically work.
Changing NIKI's tyres.
Four men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks.
The same Italian MECHANIC appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..
MECHANIC Hair visto?
MECHANIC Ti aveto detto di usare le slicks!
MECHANIC (See?
MECHANIC I told you to go on slicks!!)
NIKI Bullshit.
NIKI Where's Hunt?
MECHANIC There!
NIKI looks up to see the name JAMES HUNT written on the black helmet roar out of the pits ahead, with new tyres on...
NIKI C'mon...!!
NIKI screams at the MECHANICS, who are struggling.
The airguns make a high-pitched noise...something's not right.
NIKI What's GOING ON???
"Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and NIKI exit the pits in pursuit of HUNT.
But the delay has cost him dear...
Archive TV commentary from the world's race COMMENTATORS stations informs us of the positions.
MASS leading, HUNT in 3rd, LAUDA in 20th...
NIKI gives it everything he's got.
Tearing through the gears, trying to catch JAMES HUNT, breaking as late as he can, engine screaming.
He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and Swallowtail - passes one car after another.
Into 13th place now.
Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres.
NIKI's P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur.
The steering wheel shakes.
The car is right on the edge.
Cannot be driven any harder.
NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner.
Crazy speed.
And tight.
Too tight.
A mistake...
"Thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the inside.
NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155 mph.
The car jerks horribly to the right..
"Crunch", hits the embankment, then "Bang", hits the barrier, and is thrown across the track..
Fire breaks out in the engine.
NIKI's eyes widen in horror, with another car bearing down upon him...
NIKI No...!
The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, "Crash", a sickening, terrifying impact.
The car explodes.
Seventy litres of burning high-octane gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his seatbelt.
Locked in a blast furnace.
NIKI screams as the flames engulf him.
800 degrees temperature.
Trapped inside his car.
Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...
Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV commentators helplessly describe what's happening..
NIKI's POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..
Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo NIKI's seatbelt..
Fire extinguishers blast at the car.
Dry powder extinguishers.
Covering NIKI's helmet.
Blurring his vision, as he cries out in agony, inhaling the powder..
Screaming voices.
Panicked reactions.
On the side of the car, the painted name `Niki Lauda' blisters and melts.
Then sound fades.
As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.
Over this: the sound of a ringing phone...
We're in a busy hospital A&E unit.
Noise.
Crowds.
A regular Saturday late afternoon.
The phone continues to ring..
Finally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20's, run-off-her- feet, breathlessly picks up the phone.
NURSE Emergency...
She covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is being said.
Then her expression changes...
NURSE Okay...standing by!
The NURSE hangs up...then calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR colleagues...
NURSE That was the race-track..!
NURSE There's been an accident..!
NURSE A driver's been injured and is on his way in..!
Instantly the atmosphere changes.
A hive of activity as DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma...
All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way.
The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by...
Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks through and into the accident and emergency unit.
Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT, (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair...
A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to describe an Englishman.
SEXY.
Blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no mistake.
He rocks.
Drop-dead gorgeous..
JAMES I think the racetrack telephoned ahead that I was coming?
JAMES Hunt?
JAMES James Hunt..?
JAMES notices all the NURSES staring..
JAMES What's the matter?
JAMES No one seen a spot of blood before?
NURSE Are you all right?
JAMES Absolutely fine.
The attractive NURSE is examining JAMES, opening his overalls, checking for wounds, cuts and bruises...
NURSE We all thought you'd been in an accident.
JAMES I have.
JAMES If you call a friendly disagreement with another driver an accident.
NURSE What did you disagree about?
JAMES None of your business.
JAMES Ouch.
NURSE Sorry.
JAMES His wife.
NURSE That's going to need a couple of stitches.
NURSE It's a nasty cut.
JAMES It was a nasty blow.
JAMES Done with a bloody spanner.
NURSE Why?
NURSE What did you do?
JAMES Nothing!
JAMES Only what she begged me to do.
The NURSE notices bruising on JAMES's chest...
NURSE Which was..?
She examines him, testing his ribs for fractures, his chest..
JAMES looks up.
Their eyes meet..
JAMES Be happy to show you if you like.
`Crash', the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble through, mid-embrace, tearing at one another's clothes...
The apartment is basic.
Cramped.
Messy.
Like that of a poor student.
Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints.
Empty beer cans.
A toaster.
A kettle.
A stereo.
A cage containing two budgerigars.
A mattress on the floor.
Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England's crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition, leaving behind its strong, imperial past.
JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half- dressed, but already passionately making love...
JAMES (V/O) I have a theory why women like racing drivers.
JAMES (V/O) It's not because they respect what we do...driving round and round in circles.
JAMES (V/O) Mostly they think that's pathetic.
JAMES (V/O) And they're probably right..
JAMES (V/O) It's our closeness to death.
JAMES and the NURSE continue noisily, tirelessly making love in the shower...
JAMES (V/O) The closer you are to death, the more alive you FEEL...the more alive you ARE.
JAMES (V/O) And they can see that in you.
JAMES (V/O) FEEL that in you.
JAMES (V/O) The way you live.
JAMES (V/O) Willing to risk everything.
JAMES (V/O) (contid) With no thought for tomorrow...as if each day is your last.
It's a wonderful way to live...and the ONLY way to drive.
The only way to get that tenth of a second on everyone else...
The lovemaking becomes more intense...
JAMES (V/O) To dare to be one step bolder...one step faster...
JAMES is covered in perspiration, out on the edge...
JAMES (V/O) Sure one step closer to death...
JAMES and the NURSE, both screaming as they approach orgasm...
JAMES (V/O) But one step closer to victory, too...
JAMES and the NURSE both climax together...and collapse on the bed.
Exhausted.
A grotty old race track in South London.
JAMES and the NURSE arrive at Crystal Palace race track in his battered old mini.
They get out.
She looks up, seeing the mechanics, the racing teams, the cars..
NURSE I've never been to a Grand Prix before.
JAMES You still haven't.
JAMES This is Formula 3.
NURSE What's that?
JAMES A lower division.
JAMES Where people like me mess about in the hope of finding sponsors or being talent-spotted to race in Formula 1.
JAMES leads the NURSE into...
The pits where JAMES introduces her to his team...
JAMES Everyone, this is Nursie.
NURSIE Gemma...
JAMES Nursie, this is Doc our designer...
DOC How do you do?
JAMES Bubbles, our chief mechanic.
BUBBLES How do you do?
JAMES Le Patron - Alexander, Lord Hesketh.
HESKETH How do you do?
NURSE Fine, thanks.
NURSE Blimey...is everyone in Formula 3 this posh?
HESKETH Glass of champagne, Nursie?
NURSE It's Gemma.
NURSE No, thanks.
HESKETH You sure?
HESKETH It's Krug.
HESKETH Clos de Mesnil.
NURSE It's also ten in the morning.
HESKETH Oh, dear.
HESKETH Superstar?
HESKETH You haven't brought us a bore, have you?
JAMES strips off, changing into his racing overalls.
JAMES Trust me.
JAMES Nursie's anything BUT a bore..
The NURSE, meanwhile, drifts over to look at the car where BUBBLES is making last minute checks...
NURSE That's the car?
BUBBLES That's her.
BUBBLES The Dastle Mk 9...with the Lotus twin-cam sixteen hundred engine.
BUBBLES She's no beauty.
BUBBLES But goes like the clappers.
An odd-looking car.
A bit like a giant Go-kart, blue with yellow strips along the side and James's name in small letters.
It looks small, dangerously fragile.
JAMES Uuuurrrrrkkkkkkggghghhhh.
The NURSE is shocked to hear a dreadful watery vomiting sound.
She sees JAMES bent over behind the truck...
HESKETH Nothing to be worried about!
HESKETH Does it before every race!
HESKETH Good sign, actually.
HESKETH Means he's stoked!
JAMES continues vomiting...
JAMES (V/O) There's a lie that all drivers tell themselves.
JAMES (V/O) "Death is something that happens to other people."
JAMES (V/O) That's how you find the courage to get in the car in the first place...
JAMES emerges, wiping his mouth...
HESKETH All right, Superstar?
JAMES Never better, Patron.
JAMES (V/O) Because bad things only happen to others, right?
HESKETH Have a gargle with this.
JAMES takes a quick swig of the champagne...gargles, then swallows, puts on his balaclava...
JAMES (V/O) Problem is deep down you know that's a lie.
JAMES (V/O) That it could happen to you at any moment.
HESKETH Quick toke of this...
HESKETH passes over a joint, which JAMES inhales, taking a huge lungful from....
JAMES (V/O) So how do you make that terror go away?
JAMES (V/O) Well, booze is good for that.
JAMES (V/O) And wacky baccy.
JAMES (V/O) But better than everything else is...sex.
JAMES goes to the NURSE...and kisses her full on the lips, then puts on his helmet, and athletically vaults into the car.
JAMES hits the ignition, and a deafening high-pitched SCREAM as the engine starts...
HESKETH Ahhhh!
HESKETH What music!
HESKETH They could never have predicted it, those pioneers that invented the automobile that it would possess us like this, in our imaginations, our dreams.
HESKETH Nursie, men love women...but even more than that, men love CARS...
JAMES notices another driver (NIKI LAUDA), his car already unloaded, (number 35) and mechanics working on it..
JAMES Who's that?
DOC He's new.
DOC Some German.
BUBBLES Austrian.
JAMES Is there a difference?
JAMES looks over.
On the side of the car, painted markings, in the form of a signature, "Niki Lauda".
JAMES All bloody Goosesteppers.
JAMES is neck and neck with NIKI.
They go into a corner.
NIKI gets there first.
Up ahead though, approaching the second bend...JAMES sees the tiniest, slimmest crack to overtake.
No right-minded driver would risk it.
Only a suicidal maniac.
Which just happens to describe JAMES perfectly..
JAMES goes for it.
Daringly.
Brilliantly.
And forces NIKI to slam on his brakes to prevent a certain crash...
HESKETH, BUBBLES, DOC and the NURSE watch from the sidelines...
BUBBLES That move was suicide!
HESKETH It was also quite brilliant!!
HESKETH God he's got balls!!
JAMES carries on driving.
Flat out.
But on the flat, NIKI suddenly comes out of nowhere.
As if his car has 50 bhp more.
And overtakes JAMES.
NIKI begins to pull away.
And has the Englishman beaten..
JAMES sees red mist...and in an act of do-or-die vengeful madness, JAMES goes into a corner far too fast...
...yanks his steering wheel.
And outrageously shunts NIKI's car.
An unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness.
NIKI and JAMES's cars both veer off...go into wild, lethal spins..but luckily for JAMES he ends up facing the right way...
...and despite being badly shaken, dizzy, JAMES is able to change gears, and continue driving...
NIKI's car, by contrast, has stalled...and now ends up facing THE WRONG WAY on the track...
NIKI's eyes look up to see all the cars coming over a brow, like a herd of Wildebeest, heading towards him...
NIKI Umgotteswillen...
NIKI rips open his seat-belt, is about to get out of his car, when one car shoots straight over the nose of his car.
NIKI ducks, then bravely leaps for cover, as....
"SMASH", one of the oncoming cars shunts into his car, (it would have killed him instantly).
"WHAM", another car narrowly misses him...
"CRASH", another car forces NIKI into an evasive dive...
Cars scream past him on all sides as the race continues...
NIKI, battered, shaken, has had an unbelievably close escape.
He rips off his helmet, furious...
And now we see NIKI LAUDA's face for the first time.
Sharp- featured.
Intelligent eyes.
Dark hair.
Protruding teeth.
Something unmistakably rat-like about him.
JAMES is on the podium, having won.
He's with the NURSE, and HESKETH and BUBBLES and his team, spraying them with champagne..
NIKI walks past the podium, holding his blue helmet, and shouts out, still incandescent...
NIKI Hey...asshole!
NIKI That was my line!
NIKI I had that corner...
JAMES You mean the one you spun out of?
JAMES And finished facing the other way?
JAMES I think that corner had you.
Laughter.
NIKI That move was total suicide.
NIKI What if I hadn't braked?
NIKI We'd have crashed..!!
JAMES But we didn't, did we?
JAMES Thanks to your impeccable `survival' instincts...
JAMES makes chicken noises...
NIKI Fuck you!
NIKI What's your name?
HESKETH James Simon Wallis Hunt.
HESKETH Remember it, my little Jerry friend.
HESKETH Because one day he will be World Champion.
JAMES Jawohl.
JAMES Remember ze name.
JAMES Very simple.
JAMES "Hunt".
JAMES It rhymes with....
"BEEEEP", a car horn hoots nearby, blocking out JAMES's c-word insult...
JAMES ...a word that happens to describe you perfectly.
Laughter.
NIKI gives JAMES the finger, "Screw you, asshole".
The NURSE watches NIKI go..
NURSE Who was that?
JAMES No one.
JAMES Chippy little Kraut.
JAMES Bad loser.
JAMES Forget him.
NIKI continues to walk off, middle finger raised..
To establish: the Austrian capital.
OVER THIS: the sound of NIKI's voice...
NIKI (V/O) In my home town, Vienna, my family is famous for one thing.
NIKI (V/O) Business.
NIKI (V/O) My grandfather was a businessman, my father, too...
NIKI is in front of a mirror, and dresses smartly in a jacket, and open necked shirt, evidently a little nervous...
NIKI (V/O) So when they heard I wanted to race cars for a living, they had a few things to say...
A large, forbidding dining room.
NIKI's FATHER and terrifying GRANDFATHER, are eating supper.
GRANDFATHER shakes his head, clearly disapproves and barks in German...(we see subtitles)
GRANDFATHER Never!
GRANDFATHER Racing is for playboys and dilettantes.
GRANDFATHER Frivolous amateurs with nothing in their heads.
GRANDFATHER The name `Lauda' appears on the front pages, with politicians and economists, not on the back pages with...
GRANDFATHER ...footballers and skiers.
GRANDFATHER If you want my money, you do as I say and follow me into my business..
NIKI stares at his GRANDFATHER..
NIKI (V/O) It's in moments like this that you discover who you really are..
...and in a move that he knows will rupture the family for ever, NIKI gets to his feet..
NIKI Fine.
NIKI Keep your money.
NIKI Don't invest in me.
NIKI But when I'm World Champion, and I have the trophy, and my name is not just on the back pages, but on the front too, you will regret it.
NIKI walks out, the old man's insults ringing in his ears...
GRANDFATHER You dare sit at my table and lecture me on what I will or won't regret?
GRANDFATHER Get out!
GRANDFATHER Impertinent wretch!
GRANDFATHER Consider yourself disowned!
NIKI is in a meeting with visibly concerned BANKERS and LAWYERS.
They speak in German...
BANKER Another loan?
BANKER Herr Lauda, you still haven't repaid the other...
BANKER 2 Three..
BANKER Totalling millions of Schillings.
BANKER Plus your Grandfather called to inform us he will no longer be offering security.
NIKI I know.
NIKI There is no room for failure.
NIKI I understand that.
NIKI (V/O) But I was still a Lauda...
NIKI is driving his car.
Beside him, is the attache case on his lap.
His car passes under a motorway sign reading "Flughafen".
(Airport)...
NIKI (V/O) ...which meant I was still a businessman above everything else.
A private jet.
A balding, blazered Englishman in late middle- age (LOUIS STANLEY), owner of BRM racing, disembarks onto the tarmac...
NIKI (V/O) It just so happens that the business I deal in is speed.
NIKI sits with LOUIS STANLEY in an airport cafe.
Contracts are open on the table.
NIKI is signing.
LOUIS STANLEY is counter-signing...
STANLEY In return for your money you get a car, mechanics and a place on the team.
STANLEY Plus fifty per cent of starting fees and bonuses for podium finishes.
NIKI Who's the number one driver?
STANLEY Clay Regazzoni and you will defer to him at all times.
NIKI takes out his cheque book and pen.
He looks up...
NIKI Why would I defer to him if I am paying his wages?
NIKI writes the cheque.
STANLEY's smile fades..
STANLEY Because he's a proven winner at the highest level, a good guy, and someone who quite frankly, could teach you a thing or two.
NIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract...
NIKI OK.
NIKI There is one clause missing.
STANLEY The one about mechanics' exclusivity?
STANLEY Sorry.
STANLEY We have a cardinal rule at BRM.
STANLEY All information is shared between ALL our drivers..
NIKI And I made it perfectly clear that my mechanics work for me.
NIKI No one else.
NIKI This is something I cannot sign.
NIKI takes back the cheque.
STANLEY stares...
STANLEY All right.
STANLEY I'll have the lawyers amend it.
NIKI While you're at it you can tell them to amend the clause for podium finishes.
NIKI Podium is first THREE places, not just wins.
NIKI puts the cheque in his attache case.
Snaps it shut, taking it with him..
NIKI You'll get the money on signature, as agreed.
NIKI See you at winter testing.
NIKI gets to his feet, and leaves.
STANLEY watches the attache case disappear.
STANLEY If that little git drives half as well as he negotiates, we're going to be fine.
An awards ceremony is in progress.
The room is thick with cigar and cigarette smoke.
A presenter on stage, wearing black tie...
PRESENTER I'm delighted to say the winner of the British Guild of Motoring Writers award for the `Most Promising Driver of the Year' is James Hunt...
A loud, boisterous cheer goes up at the Hesketh Racing table.
JAMES turns to a (new/different) girlfriend beside him, gives her a lingering kiss on the lips, then gets to his feet, shakes hands with HESKETH, and BUBBLES and skips up to the podium...
JAMES Thank you.
JAMES My parents always wanted me to be a doctor, or stockbroker, and gave me a first class education...but to no avail.
JAMES My brothers are the success stories.
JAMES I get bored easily.
JAMES I have a hot head, an inability to tolerate discipline.
JAMES I fall out with people left and right.
JAMES I'm quick to settle matters with my fists.
JAMES The only creatures I've ever loved and treated well, are budgerigars.
JAMES In any normal area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total liability.
JAMES All I've got going for me is I'm quick in a car.
A good-looking woman calls out..
WOMAN That's not all!
Laughter.
JAMES So thank you for acknowledging that.
JAMES And giving me this...
JAMES I'm going to give it to my Dad, and tell him to put it on the mantle-piece and imagine it's a first class degree in medicine.
Afterwards: everyone is celebrating.
Thanks to JAMES, every pretty woman in the club is around.
The trophy is perched beside bottles of champagne...
HESKETH Well done, Superstar.
HESKETH One more season in F2 then I'll move you up.
HESKETH To the big time.
JAMES You don't think I'm ready now?
HESKETH You are!
HESKETH I'm not!
HESKETH I've got to find you a car first.
HESKETH And the money.
HESKETH The economics of Formula 1 are terrifying.
BUBBLES Hurry up.
BUBBLES You don't want him to do what Lauda did.
`Pop', HESKETH opens a bottle of champagne...
BUBBLES (contid) The Goosestepper.
BUBBLES (contid) Remember him?
JAMES makes the chicken noises again..
BUBBLES Said he no longer wanted to risk his life with "a bunch of crazy amateurs and losers..."
JAMES Is that what he called us?
DOC Charming!
HESKETH Nothing wrong with being an amateur!
BUBBLES Said if he was going to risk his life, he would only do so on the big roulette table.
BUBBLES Formula 1.
BUBBLES So he got himself a drive with BRM.
JAMES What?
JAMES How?
JAMES He never won a thing!
JAMES Not a single bloody race.
HESKETH Amateurs are what made this country great.
BUBBLES Took out a loan, apparently.
BUBBLES Paid for it himself.
HESKETH "In war, as in lovemaking, amateurs are invariably better than professionals."
HESKETH Napoleon Bonaparte.
BUBBLES A hundred and fifty grand!
JAMES A hundred and fifty grand?
JAMES stares.
Already sick with envy.
JAMES That's either an act of utter lunacy, or the ballsiest thing I ever heard.
The PAUL RICARD circuit near Marseilles in the South of France.
Where all winter training and testing is done.
NIKI arrives.
An attractive woman (AGNES) greets him...
NIKI Niki Lauda.
NIKI Here for pre-season testing.
NIKI BRM?
AGNES Take a seat, please.
AGNES I'll get someone to come and collect you...
NIKI watches as she telephones the BRM workshops...
AGNES Hi.
AGNES There's someone here for you?
NIKI Lauda.
She hangs up.
NIKI decides against pointing out her mistake.
AGNES They'll be right here.
NIKI Thank you.
A silence.
The RECEPTIONIST continues with her work.
NIKI watches her, unsure what to say, (small-talk not his forte)...
NIKI Worked here long?
AGNES Excuse me?
NIKI Just wondered if you've worked here long?
AGNES Almost eight years.
NIKI That long?
NIKI And they didn't promote you yet?
AGNES Yes, several times.
AGNES I am the AGNES.
AGNES Agnes Bonnet.
AGNES If you're looking for the receptionist, she's on her lunch.
NIKI is thrown.
Feels humiliated.
A total jerk.
He is about to say something when the door opens, and...
Two other F1 DRIVERS walk in..
Glamorous, long-haired, tanned, fashionable - like rock stars, they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES.
What are you doing answering the phones?
New haircut!
Like it.
What have you done to the weather?
They make her laugh.
And smile.
NIKI feels invisible.
Embarrassed.
Awkward.
Inadequate.
He gets to his feet.
And goes to the car that has come to collect him.
As he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him.
Ignoring the other DRIVERS.
Intrigued.
He's different.
Interesting.
Intense.
Intelligent eyes.
The car pulls up outside the workshops.
NIKI gets out of the car, and is greeted by LOUIS STANLEY, and the BRM team...
STANLEY Niki, let me introduce you to our number 1 driver, Clay Regazzoni..and our number 2, Jean Pierre Beltoise..
The intimidating, muscular, moustachioed figure of CLAY REGAZZONI, the Swiss driver.
NIKI and CLAY shake hands.
STANLEY And these are your mechanics, reporting exclusively to you.
STANLEY As per contract...
REGAZZONI, BELTOISE and STANLEY exchange looks as NIKI shakes hands, ad-libbed greetings with his MECHANICS.
MECHANIC You want to see the car?
NIKI is led into the workshop to see a red and white Marlboro sponsored car, number 21, with a tall air-intake duct just above the driver's helmet...
MECHANIC There she is.
MECHANIC The P160..
NIKI Same as Regazzoni's?
MECHANIC Identical in every detail.
NIKI scrutinizes the car...
NIKI She looks heavy.
NIKI How much does she weigh?
MECHANIC 540 kilos.
NIKI That's crazy.
NIKI Why so heavy..?
MECHANIC It's a 3 litre, V12 engine, that thing weighs 190k alone.
NIKI What horsepower are you getting out of it?
NIKI Not enough.
NIKI Needs to be 500 and the engine needs to be 20k lighter.
MECHANIC We already tried...
NIKI Did you use magnesium parts?
The MECHANICS look at one another skeptically...
Shooting from above:
The entire car has been stripped to a thousand pieces.
Now spread all over the workshop floor.
NIKI's team of mechanics reluctantly work through the night making the adjustments which NIKI is suggesting...
NIKI Any solid plate, strip it out...
More disbelieving, skeptical looks.
The car is in pieces on the floor.
NIKI brews coffee to keep people alert.
Focused.
NIKI And when we've done that, we need to look at the aerodynamics.
NIKI Front and rear wing..
More mutinous looks.
"Who is this asshole?"
Daylight breaks over the race-track.
The doors to the workshop open, and the MECHANICS and NIKI emerge - their work done.
NIKI goes to shake hands with the MECHANICS...
NIKI OK.
NIKI Thank you.
NIKI Good night..
But they're exhausted.
Refuse to shake hands with this nut.
LATER: one of the BRM cars screams round the race-track...
NIKI watches on the sidelines as CLAY REGAZZONI is time- testing his car.
He walks over to where LOUIS STANLEY and several MECHANICS are doing the timings...
NIKI What was his time?
STANLEY Two minutes six seconds.
NIKI OK.
NIKI Now put him in my car, and he'll go round under two minutes.
STANLEY Six seconds faster?
STANLEY Impossible.
NIKI looks up to see AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER again on the other side of the track.
NIKI waves hi.
AGNES waves back.
Smiles.
NIKI raises his eyebrow.
Surprised.
REGAZZONI gets into NIKI's car.
REGAZZONI races round the track at full speed.
REGAZZONI roars past the finishing line in NIKI's car.
LOUIS STANLEY looks at the stop watch..
His expression changes.
STANLEY comes into the workshop where NIKI and his MECHANICS are in conversation, getting changed...
STANLEY All right.
STANLEY What did you do to the car?
NIKI That's information I will share with you under certain conditions only.
STANLEY stares, bracing himself..
STANLEY Go on...
NIKI A guaranteed place in the team, and a paid contract on equal terms with Regazzoni for two years.
STANLEY Are you crazy?
STANLEY Clay's a senior figure in Formula One...you're a rookie.
STANLEY The only reason we took you ON was because you were paying us.
NIKI Well, as of now, if you want me to stay, we rip up the contract.
NIKI I don't pay you a cent.
STANLEY It's outrageous.
NIKI Was he quicker in my car?
NIKI He was, wasn't he?
STANLEY stares...
NIKI Did he go under two minutes?
STANLEY One fifty-six.
NIKI So have a think, work out your priorities, and get back to me.
NIKI turns, and goes.
STANLEY stares...
STANLEY Not even my WIFE speaks to me like that.
CLAY REGAZZONI emerges from testing his car.
Still amazed by the improved performance.
Talking to his MECHANICS.
In awe.
He removes his helmet, then stops.
In the distance he sees NIKI talking to AGNES the attractive TRACK MANAGER.
They are clearly hitting it off..
NIKI is in the showers, then getting changed for his date with AGNES.
He is about to go, when he stops, and sees...
CLAY REGAZZONI getting undressed, looking at NIKI.
CLAY speaks English with an Italian accent..
REGAZZONI I know what you're going to say.
REGAZZONI That it's none of my business...
NIKI What?
REGAZZONI If it's the Track Manager you're taking on your date tonight?
NIKI immediately becomes defensive...
NIKI It's none of your business.
REGAZZONI Okay, but if you want my advice...I'd let this one go.
REGAZZONI I'm not questioning your taste.
REGAZZONI She's a great girl.
REGAZZONI (contid) But Agnes's last boyfriend was a British Formula 2 driver, who has a reputation for two things.
REGAZZONI (contid) For being a suicidal jerk on the track, and for going all night, and all day afterwards...and all night again in bed.
REGAZZONI (contid) He's an OK driver, but an IMMORTAL fuck, apparently.
REGAZZONI (contid) I don't know about you, but that's not an act I'd like to follow.
REGAZZONI (contid) But if that doesn't bother you...
NIKI What's his name?
NIKI The driver?
REGAZZONI Hunt.
REGAZZONI James Hunt.
NIKI stares.
Can hardly believe it.
REGAZZONI See?
REGAZZONI You share information, I share information.
CLAY slaps NIKI on his back, and goes into the showers..
REGAZZONI That's what team-mates are for.
NIKI Thanks.
A restaurant in Marseilles.
Through the window we can see AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER sitting at a table alone.
Waiting for NIKI.
Reverse angle to reveal:
NIKI is sitting in a car across the street.
He stares at AGNES in the restaurant.
Then starts his car, and drives off.
Easton Neston.
Set in 3,300 acres, one of England's great country houses.
Home to the Fermor-Hesketh family since 1700.
JAMES and a new GIRLFRIEND drive up the gravel drive in his anything but grandiose Mini.
It splutters to a stop, just in time.
They are greeted by uniformed STAFF who take his tatty bags from his filthy car.
The Hesketh Racing workshops, situated in the converted stables on the estate.
HESKETH leads a blindfolded JAMES in...
HESKETH Keep them closed...!
HESKETH Wait for it, wait for it...
HESKETH removes JAMES's blindfold...
HESKETH There!
HESKETH What do you say?
JAMES opens his eyes to see a gorgeous F1 racing car, plain white, no stickers...
HESKETH Isn't she a beauty?
HESKETH The March 731.
HESKETH Converted by the brilliant Doc..!
DOC POSTLETHWAITE takes a modest bow.
JAMES shakes hands with everyone, including his brother, (and manager), PETER..
JAMES She is a beauty.
JAMES But...haven't you made a mistake?
HESKETH What?
JAMES That's not a Formula 2 car.
JAMES She's F1.
HESKETH She is, Superstar.
HESKETH Why?
HESKETH Because I got together with the beancounters, and it turns out that the economics of F1 are not so significantly different to the economics of Formula 2...
BUBBLES clears his throat, dutifully bites his tongue..
HESKETH So we thought if we were going to be messing about losing money we might as well be doing it with the big boys.
JAMES Are you serious?
HESKETH Never been more serious in my life!
JAMES embraces HESKETH in excitement, kisses him...
HESKETH Actually, I got the idea after what you said about the Austrian chap who bought his way in rather than waste his time in the lower divisions.
HESKETH I thought, "Bloody hell, he's right!"
JAMES slips into the cockpit...
JAMES Well done the Goosestepper!!
HESKETH No sponsorship, Superstar!
HESKETH I hope you approve.
JAMES I do, Patron.
HESKETH No vulgar logos for cigarettes, or condoms.
HESKETH Just plain white.
HESKETH With the Union Jack.
HESKETH And racing overalls which read...
HESKETH indicates JAMES's hanging racing overalls...
HESKETH "Sex.
HESKETH Breakfast of Champions."
HESKETH Unless it's me, of course, in which case it's two kippers, porridge, boiled eggs, and half a dozen slices of toast...
Laughter.
JAMES So when do we start?
HESKETH Soon as you're ready.
JAMES I'm ready now.
HESKETH That's my boy!
HESKETH pops champagne...
HESKETH They won't know what's hit them!
To establish: a Formula 1 race track on Grand Prix week-end..
A helicopter comes in to land.
The Hesketh Racing Team makes a grand entrance with a retinue of BUTLERS, GIRLS, ROLLS' ROYCE's, oysters, champagne...
A famous ex-champion TV REPORTER is there (Stirling Moss) providing skeptical commentary about Hesketh's debut...
STIRLING MOSS ...hard to tell whether Lord Hesketh and his team of upper class enthusiasts is bringing glamour to the racing community, or just comedy...
They walk around in their own branded clothing.
Alexander's jacket reads, "Le Patron".
He speaks to MOSS.
Rolled eyes among other racing teams who express surprise, curiosity (and frequently disapproval) at these new arrivals..
STIRLING MOSS It's certainly the first time I can remember seeing a butler serving caviar and oysters in the pits...
Suddenly pandemonium breaks out.
Screams.
Something has happened.
A bad accident on the track.
During testing...
STIRLING MOSS ...reports are reaching me of a serious accident that has just taken place in qualifying....
All smiles fade.
The party atmosphere changes in a flash.
Panic breaks out.
The sound of sirens.
Ambulances rushing to the scene of the accident.
All the JOURNALISTS and TV CREWS rush off, too.
HESKETH, BUBBLES and JAMES look at one another, put down their champagne glasses, and follow...
Mangled wreckage.
A car has crashed into (badly installed) Armco guard rails, splitting the railing in two...
The DRIVER has been decapitated.
His helmeted HEAD lies cleanly severed on the ground...
A goldfish-bowl of blood.
It's a horrific accident.
People SCREAM and look away.
Even hardened medical professionals...
JAMES, HESKETH, BUBBLES arrive on the scene of the accident.
But they are kept away, at a distance...
STIRLING MOSS ...it seems the driver...just twenty- six years old....was killed on impact...and the death toll in Formula 1 shows no sign of slowing down...
JAMES, dressed in his overalls, is violently retching.
Sick with nerves.
A TV plays in the pits...
COMMENTATOR ...in the last five years alone Formula 1 has lost Piers Courage, Jo Siffert, Peter Revson, Jochen Rindt, Francois Cevert, Roger Williamson...
ON TV: quickfire clips of the terrible, violent deaths.
BUBBLES hastily switches off the TV as JAMES walks past...
JAMES walks out of the paddock, towards his car.
Other DRIVERS gathered in concerned groups, talking...
DRIVER It's terrible.
JAMES They should cancel the race.
Then, a distinctive Austrian accent..
NIKI Why?
NIKI No one came to see him anyway.
NIKI He made a mistake.
NIKI Went into the corner too fast.
JAMES Is that right?
JAMES So says the nobody who had to pay for his own drive.
JAMES How's that working out, by the way?
NIKI Fine.
NIKI How's it at the back?
JAMES Not planning on being there for long.
NIKI Good.
NIKI Look forward to you showing me the way today.
JAMES `Be happy to.
JAMES I'll have you inside lap one.
NIKI Yeah right.
JAMES walks off to his car, shaking his head..
JAMES Asshole.
NIKI walks to his car, putting on his helmet.
NIKI Asshole.
NIKI is on the podium, spraying champagne.
He is wearing the victor's garland...
Meanwhile: JAMES's car is embarrassingly being brought back by a tow-truck.
NIKI watches from the podium..
His eyes meet JAMES's..
JAMES and BUBBLES and PETER HUNT (JAMES's blazer-wearing manager and elder brother), sit together at a table in the corner.
It's late.
A frank post-mortem.
Drinking and talking..
JAMES Niki humiliated me today.
JAMES He lapped me three times.
BUBBLES He lapped Carlos Pace six times.
JAMES That's supposed to console me?
JAMES What do I need to do?
PETER Grow up.
JAMES Shut up, Moneyman.
JAMES `Didn't ask you..
BUBBLES Your brother's right.
BUBBLES You've got to change your attitude.
BUBBLES We all do.
BUBBLES And match it with a whole different mental approach.
BUBBLES Professionalism.
BUBBLES Maturity.
BUBBLES Like Niki.
PETER Bet he doesn't go out every night, drink and screw himself stupid.
JAMES So speaks the jealous married man..
PETER No.
PETER So speaks the manager who's wasting his time, making ten per cent of absolutely nothing.
BUBBLES You've just got to take it more seriously.
BUBBLES Yourself more seriously.
PETER Something he's never done.
JAMES Don`t patronize me, Pete...
BUBBLES We need you to spend less time in bars and nightclubs...
PETER Make that NO time...
BUBBLES And more time with the mechanics, setting up the car.
BUBBLES That's what Lauda does.
BUBBLES 24 hours a day.
JAMES rolls his eyes...
BUBBLES God knows there's nothing wrong with your talent.
BUBBLES Or courage.
BUBBLES It's purely a character issue right now.
JAMES And the good news is I've got Sigmund Freud Horsely, failed driver par excellence, and a washed-up accountant to lecture me on it.
PETER Jesus, James...
BUBBLES walks off.
PETER HUNT walks off.
JAMES calls out..
JAMES Bubbles?
JAMES I'm sorry..!
JAMES I didn't mean that!
JAMES Come back..!
The grand Hesketh estate in the Northamptonshire countryside.
JAMES is in the workshops, his hands and arms filthy, he's been working on the car - but now his eyes are closed.
Memorizing tracks.
Around him people are working on the car..
JAMES ....along the Beau Rivage, long left into Massenet, into the short right of Casino.
JAMES Sharp right into Mirabeau, then sharp left into Loews, mind the guard rails...
VOICE Is Alexander around..?
JAMES opens his eyes to see an endless pair of legs, a drop- dead gorgeous figure, and the beautiful smiling face of SUZY MILLER, the most successful model of the day.
JAMES He was.
JAMES Then went to the house to take a call.
JAMES He'll be back shortly.
SUZY Only he wanted to show off his pride and joy...
SUZY indicates the car...
SUZY ...rhymes with `boy' if you ask me.
SUZY And `toy'.
SUZY I can't believe what I'm seeing.
JAMES Why?
SUZY It's just so small!
SUZY For something that costs so much.
SUZY And so flimsy.
SUZY There's no comfort.
SUZY No protection.
SUZY Nothing.
JAMES No.
JAMES Just a little coffin, surrounded by high-octane fuel, being driven round at 170 miles per hour..
JAMES (contid) To all intents and purposes a bomb.
JAMES (contid) On wheels.
SUZY Why don't they make it safer?
JAMES No one wants it to be.
JAMES It's like saying why not make bullfighting safer?
JAMES It's a blood sport.
JAMES The risk of death turns people on.
JAMES Without it, I guess, it'd be half the fun.
JAMES Which is fine for the voyeurs, fine for TV, fine for everyone..
JAMES ...except us drivers.
SUZY looks JAMES up and down.
Sees the bare feet, the rock star good looks...
SUZY You're James, aren't you?
JAMES Yes.
SUZY Thought so.
SUZY You fit the description.
SUZY Suzy.
SUZY Friend of Alex's.
JAMES I know exactly.
In the background: one of the MECHANICS shows DOC a picture of SUZY from a tabloid newspaper.
She's clearly the most famous model in Britain, and a star in her own right...
JAMES What was the description?
SUZY Mostly positive in terms of appearance.
SUZY Negative only in terms of character.
SUZY I've been told to avoid you.
JAMES By whom?
SUZY Alex.
SUZY He says you're a bad boy.
JAMES Was.
JAMES Not any more.
JAMES New me very professional.
JAMES Early to bed.
JAMES Early to rise.
JAMES All very dull.
SUZY Really?
JAMES Round-the-clock work, practise and focus.
JAMES Tedious, but apparently the only way to vin against ze Goosestepper..
SUZY Is that what you were doing when you came in?
JAMES Visualization techniques.
JAMES Memorizing the circuit, in this case Monaco, which is next up.
JAMES Eyes closed, know your way round in your sleep...
JAMES I know...I've always been a great believer in getting there on the day, putting the old foot down and playing chicken with everyone else.
SUZY laughs..
JAMES But they don't want me to do that anymore...they want my body like a temple.
JAMES My mind like Monk.
SUZY And your soul?
SUZY Your heart?
JAMES What does that mean?
SUZY You can't be so disciplined in all areas of your life, can you..?
JAMES They want me to stop messing around, get married and settle down with the next nice girl I meet.
JAMES They think it would be good for me.
SUZY What do you think?
JAMES Sounds bloody awful.
SUZY laughs again...
JAMES But since they're right about most things, they're probably right about that, too.
JAMES looks SUZY up and down...
JAMES You don't fancy getting married, do you?
The sound of ringing bells.
London's grandest Catholic church in the heart of Knightsbridge..
JAMES and SUZY, top hat and tails, flowing white wedding dress, looking ravishing, emerge from the church.
JAMES and SUZY fall into a passionate, sexy embrace for the paparazzi cameras.
Loud cheers go up, led by HESKETH and
They make their way to the waiting convoy of cars...
On his way: JAMES spots a serious-faced HESKETH and DOC POSTLETHWAITE in conversation with some Formula 1 types in the crowd..
SUZY is pulled away for photos.
Clearly a bigger star even than JAMES.
JAMES turns to BUBBLES, indicates HESKETH...
JAMES What's up?
BUBBLES Nothing.
BUBBLES I don't want to ruin your day.
BUBBLES stares, then reluctantly...
BUBBLES It seems your revenge against the Goosestepper might have to wait a little longer than you'd hoped.
BUBBLES He's just been signed by Ferrari.
JAMES WHAT???
JAMES But that's the best team in the world.
JAMES They could have ANYONE.
JAMES Did he pay his way in there, too?
BUBBLES Apparently they took back Regazzoni and he insisted they give Lauda a trial.
BUBBLES Thinks he's a genius.
BUBBLES Setting up the cars...
JAMES stares...then is pulled away to pose in photographs with SUZY and her FAMILY.
FERRARI's state-of-the-art practise facilities and private test-track in Northern Italy.
Closed circuit television, with 10 cameras and a complex track timing system and computers....
ENZO FERRARI himself, the Commendatore, a formidable white- haired patriarch in Onassis dark glasses, reads newspapers, sitting by the race tracks, barely looking up as two red Ferrari's roar round the track...
LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO, the young, dynamic, aristocratic manager of the Scuderia, by contrast, watches eagle-eyed..
The two cars stop, and NIKI and CLAY REGAZZONI gets out.
NIKI talks (in a mix of Italian and English) to his MECHANIC, giving them typically blunt feedback...
NIKI It's terrible!
NIKI Drives like a pig!
MECHANIC Sssshhh!
MECHANIC You can't say that!
NIKI Why not?
MECHANIC It's a Ferrari!
NIKI I've driven better milk floats.
NIKI It understeers like crazy and the weight distribution is a disaster...
The MECHANIC gulps, then walks over to where the terrifying COMMENDATORE and LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO are sitting, and passes on the information...
MECHANIC He says the car is magnificent, a masterpiece, but he has suggestions for one or two minor refinements...
A large press conference, with motoring JOURNALISTS and television CREWS from all over the world attending...
ENZO FERRARI and LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO addresses the conference (in Italian) which is translated by a translator...
ENZO We are happy to welcome back to the Ferrari family our good friend, Clay Regazzoni...and also to introduce, from Austria Niki Lauda..
A burst of flash photography.
NIKI and REGAZZONI sit side by side.
A car drives fast on country roads in Northern Italy...
CLAY REGAZZONI is driving, NIKI is in the passenger seat...
REGAZZONI "Ferrari Family".
REGAZZONI "Our good friend, Clay Regazzoni".
REGAZZONI (contid) You're friend and family to the Commendatore as long as you win.
REGAZZONI (contid) The minute you don't..
NIKI I understand.
NIKI It's business.
NIKI I would be the same.
REGAZZONI But it isn't just business, is it?
REGAZZONI What we do?
REGAZZONI It's passion.
REGAZZONI Love.
REGAZZONI Which is why we're prepared to risk our lives for it.
NIKI Not me.
NIKI If I thought I had more talent and could earn better money doing something else, I would.
REGAZZONI But how do you know you will make money here?
REGAZZONI You haven't yet.
NIKI Not yet.
NIKI But I will.
NIKI If you can, I can.
REGAZZONI shakes his head, can't help smiling...
REGAZZONI You know, are you ever NOT an asshole?
NIKI laughs...
NIKI Why am I an asshole?
NIKI You know by now I'm both quicker than you and better at setting up the car.
NIKI You can't deal with that, then you're the asshole.
REGAZZONI Screw you.
REGAZZONI pulls up outside the house...
REGAZZONI (contid) I brought you along today because you seem like a lonely kind of guy.
REGAZZONI (contid) I thought if I introduce you to some nice people, it'd be good for you.
REGAZZONI (contid) Forget it.
REGAZZONI (contid) Make your own friends.
REGAZZONI walks ahead, disappears through the front door, where he is warmly welcomed, and invited into a party.
NIKI calls after him...
NIKI I'm sorry.
NIKI C'mon, Clay...
NIKI stares through the window.
Inside: a very appealing looking bunch - young, good-looking, cool, sexy GUESTS - all having a good time..
By contrast: NIKI catches his own reflection in the glass reflection.
Pale.
Intense.
The outsider.
Inside: REGAZZONI is surrounded by friends, telling a story.
Everyone laughs.
NIKI watches.
Then turns to walk away.
As he goes, the front door opens...
And a beautiful dark-haired woman (MARLENE) emerges loading several BAGS into a car.
Brunette, tan.
Wearing a white dress.
NIKI Are you leaving?
MARLENE Yes.
NIKI Can you give me a lift to the nearest town?
NIKI Anywhere with a train station.
MARLENE Sure.
MARLENE Nearest town is half an hour's drive.
MARLENE Get in.
The car drives.
The radio plays.
Marlene sings along.
NIKI can't help noticing something.
He turns down the music.
MARLENE's smile fades..
MARLENE What are you doing?
NIKI You hear that noise when you accelerate?
MARLENE No.
NIKI Your drive belt is loose.
MARLENE My what?
NIKI Alternator.
NIKI And when you brake, your foot goes all the way down.
NIKI Means there's air in the system.
MARLENE Anything else?
NIKI No.
NIKI Apart from the rear brakes are imbalanced.
NIKI The front right wheel is flat, and it feels like a crack in the engine block...which explains why you're drifting so much.
MARLENE How can you tell?
NIKI My ass.
MARLENE What?
NIKI God gave me an OK mind, but a really good ass, which can feel everything in a car.
MARLENE You don't know what you're talking about.
MARLENE The car is fine.
MARLENE And it just had a service a week ago.
NIKI Not a good one.
MARLENE A very good one.
MARLENE From a proper garage.
MARLENE It cost a fortune.
MARLENE This car is good as new.
MARLENE Relax.
White smoke pours from the engine.
The car has broken down.
Bonnet up.
NIKI has tried fixing it, but to no avail.
NIKI has a fan belt in his hand, but it's all but disintegrated under the heat of the over-worked engine.
NIKI's hands are covered in oil.
He is pushing a pen into a large crack in the engine, slick with oil and grease.
NIKI Nothing I can do here.
NIKI The car needs a garage.
MARLENE I'm sorry.
MARLENE You're not in a hurry, are you?
NIKI No.
NIKI As long as I'm back in Maranello by Monday morning.
NIKI walks out into the road.
Sticks out his thumb...
MARLENE So who are you anyway?
MARLENE breaks into GERMAN...(we see sub-titles)...
MARLENE You're from Vienna, aren't you.
MARLENE We can speak German.
MARLENE How do you know Curd?
NIKI Who's Curd?
MARLENE Curd Jurgens.
MARLENE The actor.
MARLENE It's his house.
MARLENE He is, or was until yesterday, my boyfriend.
MARLENE I must have been mad!
MARLENE There is something very attractive about an older man when they behave like one.
MARLENE But when they behave like a frightened child..
MARLENE gets to her feet...
MARLENE C'mon, let me do this.
MARLENE Otherwise we'll never get out of here.
MARLENE We're in Italy, after all.
MARLENE indicates that NIKI should take a back seat, hitches up her skirt, showing long, tanned legs..
Immediately a passing car screeches to a halt, then reverses noisily to pull level.
MARLENE smiles at NIKI...
MARLENE Not bad, eh?
MARLENE Three seconds.
MARLENE Admit it, you're impressed..!
MARLENE smiles flirtatiously at the handsome, young Italian MEN driving the open-topped sports car..
MARLENE Ciao, Regazzi...!
But the Italian MEN walk right past her, not seeing her, as if she's invisible, and stare at NIKI...
ITALIAN MAN Excuse me...are you Niki Lauda?
NIKI Yes.
ITALIAN MAN Oh, my God...!!!
ITALIAN MAN I told you it was him..!!!
ITALIAN MAN Do you need a ride?
NIKI Yes, we do...
The ITALIAN MAN gestures to his car, as his friend loads MARLENE's luggage inside...
ITALIAN MAN An honour, please!!!
ITALIAN MAN But on one condition..
The ITALIAN MAN whisper in NIKI's ear.
MARLENE stares, not understanding, as NIKI protests, but then slowly, reluctantly gets into the car.
He starts the engine.
MARLENE watches as the ITALIAN MEN strap themselves in with the seat-belts, tightening them...giggling like schoolboys..
MARLENE Will someone please tell me what's going on?
MARLENE turns to NIKI...
MARLENE Who are you, anyway?
MARLENE What do you DO?
ITALIAN MAN You don't know?
ITALIAN MAN He's a Formula I driver.
ITALIAN MAN Who just signed for Ferrari!
MARLENE Him?
MARLENE Never.
MARLENE Impossible!
ITALIAN MAN Why?
MARLENE Formula 1 drivers have long hair, are sexy, have shirts open to here..
MARLENE indicates...
MARLENE Anyway, look at the way he's driving!!
MARLENE Like an old man!!
It's true.
NIKI is driving in the slow lane.
Like a pensioner.
NIKI No need to drive fast.
NIKI It only increases the percentage of risk.
NIKI We're not in a hurry.
NIKI No one is paying me.
NIKI Right now, with zero incentive or reward, why would I drive fast?
MARLENE looks at him with her dark green eyes...
MARLENE Because I'm asking you to.
NIKI And do you always get what you want?
MARLENE Usually.
NIKI stares, trying to resist...but cannot.
He does a lightning double-declutch...
"SLAM", NIKI's foot hits the floor, the engine screams, the rev counter flies to the right...
And the open-topped sports car lurches into warp-drive...
MARLENE is thrown back hard in her seat, "Jesus", her eyes widen in terror and amazement..
MARLENE Oh, my God...!!
The ITALIAN MEN scream in excitement, holding on for dear life as NIKI, his heart not a beat over 60, takes the car to breaking point, in a way it's never been driven before...
NIKI overtakes everyone on the motorway, fearlessly weaving between cars at twice their speed..
We CLOSE on NIKI's eyes, remaining dead calm as his passengers scream all around him, as he accelerates through the other cars on the motorway...
His EYES remain calm, his WHEELS a blur of speed, and we...
Calm EYES, and WHEELS moving in a blur of speed.
We're in the middle of a Grand Prix, and NIKI is driving at the limit...
Ahead of him: a familiar sight.
The back of JAMES HUNT's Hesketh..
MARLENE watches on TV in the pits as NIKI is engaged in an epic tussle with JAMES...
Commentators note the improvement in JAMES's technique, maturity and performance.
But then, "Puff", a plume of smoke comes out of JAMES's engine.
The engine has blown...
Immediately JAMES loses speed, and NIKI sails past, overtaking effortlessly.
Taking the chequered flag.
Television commentary in various languages tells us: NIKI LAUDA has become world champion...
NIKI's car pulls in, to be mobbed by jubilant MECHANICS as he gets out of his car, removing his helmet, embraced by a delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO...
...then falling into a passionate kiss with MARLENE...
Champion of the World, he is immediately swallowed up by REPORTERS who are demanding interviews in Italian, German, English...
An impromptu party in the paddock area.
The victor's garland still round his neck, proudly holding the FIA World Champion trophy, his hair matted with champagne, NIKI passes through the crowds, accepting everyone's congratulations..
He runs into JAMES, who's in bare feet as usual.
MARLENE is pulled away to talk to someone else..
JAMES Congratulations.
NIKI Thank you.
JAMES Though with a car like that, the rest of us never stood a chance...
NIKI Maybe the fact the car is so good might have something to do with me.
JAMES You're still in a Ferrari.
JAMES And I'm still in a Hesketh.
JAMES On equal terms, the way it was in Formula 3, I'd beat you, and you know it.
NIKI Never.
NIKI You might get lucky and win one race.
NIKI Maybe two.
NIKI Because you're aggressive.
NIKI But in the long run, over the course of a season, no chance.
JAMES Why's that?
NIKI Because you're not serious.
NIKI You're just a party guy.
NIKI Which is why everyone likes you.
JAMES Now try saying that and tell me you're not jealous.
NIKI But all that affection, all those smiles is also a sign of their disrespect!
NIKI They don't fear you.
NIKI Whereas compare that to me...
JAMES Whom no one likes...
NIKI Right..
JAMES Not even his own team-mates..
NIKI Right!
NIKI Because I'm relentless.
NIKI I don't screw up.
NIKI I go to bed early.
NIKI I look after myself, look after my car.
NIKI And then, soon as the race is finished, I go home.
NIKI You should go home more often, too.
NIKI I heard you got married.
JAMES I did.
NIKI So where is she?
JAMES In New York.
JAMES Working.
NIKI You know I've never seen you with her, once...
NIKI turns to MARLENE, "Let's go"..
JAMES's Mini roars furiously up the long gravel driveway towards Easton Neston.
Screeches to a halt.
JAMES gets out of the car.
Is greeted by staff, whom he uncharacteristically ignores, storming past...
JAMES walks into the workshops where BUBBLES HORSLEY is busy doing something...
JAMES Right, whatever it takes to beat Lauda, just say it, your word is my command.
JAMES I'll do it.
JAMES There are no lengths to which I will not go.
JAMES And I mean it this time...
JAMES stops, noticing BUBBLES's expression...
JAMES What's the matter?
Then JAMES notices what BUBBLES is doing.
He's packing.
JAMES What are you doing?
Then JAMES notices the lack of activity in the workshops.
None of the usual mechanics, or engineers..
JAMES Where is everyone?
BUBBLES looks up.
Unsure how to break it to him.
An old drawing-room.
The open fire roars.
But HESKETH is uncharacteristically quiet.
Defeated..
HESKETH Do you know what the date is today?
JAMES November 14th.
HESKETH Do you have any idea of the significance of that date?
JAMES I'm assuming it refers to some animal you are allowed or no longer allowed to slaughter on your estate.
HESKETH Actually it's the deadline for securing sponsorship for the forthcoming Formula 1 season.
HESKETH Which elapsed at midnight last night.
HESKETH And we didn't attract any.
JAMES So?
JAMES We aren't looking for sponsorship.
JAMES Condoms and cigarettes.
JAMES Vulgar, right?
HESKETH Right.
HESKETH Except we are.
HESKETH Or were.
HESKETH I've made something of a miscalculation.
HESKETH The economics.
HESKETH Formula 1.
HESKETH Reality thereof.
HESKETH Turns out not like the lower divisions at all.
JAMES What are you saying?
HESKETH I'm saying it's over, Superstar.
HESKETH The banks have stepped in.
HESKETH Read me the riot act.
HESKETH Started laying everyone off.
HESKETH Probably have to sell this place.
HESKETH Fun while it lasted, would do it all again and all that...
HESKETH I daren't tell you the actual figures.
JAMES stares at a devastated HESKETH...
JAMES Christ.
JAMES is on the phone to his brother PETER, while playing Scale-electrix cars on a track alone, barefoot...
JAMES I need a drive, Pete.
JAMES Need you to find me a drive.
JAMES What does that mean?
JAMES "My reputation precedes me?"
"Crash", the electric toy car crashes...
JAMES Really?
JAMES Is that what they said?
JAMES Did they at least say a "Quick arsehole?"
JAMES Bollocks to Lotus.
JAMES Find me someone else.
JAMES I'll go mad otherwise.
"Click", JAMES hangs up.
SUZY walks in.
Sees his mood..
SUZY Don't worry.
SUZY Something will turn up.
JAMES opens a bottle of Scotch, pours himself a drink...
SUZY But I doubt that will help in the meantime.
JAMES knocks back the drink...
SUZY Why don't we go away for the week-end?
SUZY Before I leave again for New York?
JAMES carries on drinking..
SUZY Talk to me, James.
SUZY Don't make a stranger of me.
JAMES doesn't react...
SUZY I can't watch this.
SUZY picks up her coat, and bag..
JAMES What were you hoping for?
JAMES A well- adjusted knight in shining armour?
SUZY No danger of that....
JAMES Let me give you some advice.
SUZY I'm all ears...
JAMES Don't go to men who are willing to kill themselves driving in circles looking for normality.
SUZY Well, I certainly didn't get that...
JAMES Should have gone for one of my brothers.
SUZY There goes that self-pity again.
SUZY How striking it is -
JAMES What's that?
JAMES Tell me..
SUZY The gulf between appearance and reality.
SUZY Look at you, all sunshine blonde beauty and smiles...yet the reality is...a frightened, immature, depressed, self-pitying child...
JAMES At least there's SOMETHING behind the facade.
SUZY With a nasty temper..
JAMES Fuck off to New York, dear.
JAMES There must be a moisturizer or eye shadow somewhere that needs your vapid mush to flog it.
SUZY How quickly beauty can turn ugly.
JAMES Agreed.
JAMES Repellent.
SUZY stares...and goes.
JAMES carries on drinking.
The following morning.
The phone rings.
Piercing the darkness.
JAMES, clearly the worse for wear, is talking to his beloved budgies...
JAMES Good girl...
A surprising vulnerability, and childlike innocence about JAMES.
He strokes the birds with real tenderness..
The phone continues ringing.
JAMES picks it up...
JAMES (INTO PHONE) Hello?
JAMES listens, then hears something on the phone that makes him sit up...
JAMES (INTO PHONE) Who?
JAMES (INTO PHONE) McLaren?
JAMES is waking rapidly now..
JAMES (INTO PHONE) Just get me in a room with them, Pete.
JAMES (INTO PHONE) Say anything.
JAMES (INTO PHONE) Today?
JAMES (INTO PHONE) Yes, I can do today.
JAMES (INTO PHONE) I can be there in an hour.
JAMES starts scribbling down the address.
The headquarters of McLaren Racing in Colnbrook, Bucks.
A small, unassuming building on the Poyle Trading Estate.
Bare brickwork surrounds a brash yellow facade, with the words `MCLAREN RACING' in large white letters.
A large boardroom.
Team Director TEDDY MAYER (American, from Pennsylvania, short, lawyerly, 50's - hair turning grey) sits at the head of the table.
Next to him is Aussie Marlboro spokesman JOHN HOGAN and McLaren Team Manager and chief mechanic ALASTAIR CALDWELL.
The atmosphere is tense, uncomfortable...
MAYER I'll come straight to the point.
MAYER Our esteemed lead driver...
CALDWELL Fitti-fucking-paldi..
MAYER Has ditched us for another team at the last minute..
CALDWELL In November.
CALDWELL Fucking outrageous.
MAYER And we need a replacement.
MAYER Asap.
MAYER Thankfully a few hands have already gone up.
MAYER Good people...
CALDWELL Like Jackie Ickx.
JAMES I'm quicker than Jackie.
MAYER But he's consistent, dependable.
MAYER Sponsor friendly.
MAYER He'll dress up nice.
MAYER Say the right things.
JAMES What do you want?
JAMES A driver or a brushes salesman?
MAYER We want to be successful.
JAMES So do I. But I measure that in podium finishes and beating Niki Lauda not being a show pony for sponsors.
MAYER I've heard about this thing with Lauda.
CALDWELL Everyone has..
MAYER You really think you can beat him?
MAYER He's World Champion.
JAMES I beat him in Formula 3.
CALDWELL This season alone he's had eight podiums, five wins, you've had what?
HOGAN One.
JAMES Only because I've been in the wrong car.
JAMES I beat him when the playing field was level.
JAMES I'd beat him again in a McLaren.
JAMES (contid) It's the only car out there as good as the Ferrari.
JAMES (contid) Which is why I'm here, begging.
JAMES stares imploringly..
JAMES I'll do whatever you ask.
JAMES Even put on a suit, talk to sponsors and say the right thing.
JAMES I promise.
JAMES Just give me the drive...
CALDWELL, HOGAN and MAYER look at one another...
Various shots, to establish.
South Africa in the apartheid era.
We notice black race FANS unable to get into the track..
COMMENTATOR ...welcome to the Kyalami Racetrack where the big news is..
Crowds flood to the spectator stands.
The pit lane stretches into the distance, filled with cars, drivers and mechanics...
COMMENTATOR ...that Britain's James Hunt in his first race for Mclaren has qualified fastest, beating Niki Lauda's Ferrari to pole by two hundredths of a second.
COMMENTATOR In the crowds to watch the race none other than movie stars Richard Burton and Liz Taylor...
We pick out RICHARD BURTON and LIZ TAYLOR waving to screaming
NIKI and JAMES's cars lined up in positions 1 and 2 on the starting grid.
JAMES proudly indicates to NIKI...
JAMES New car.
NIKI I noticed.
JAMES Pole position.
NIKI I noticed that, too.
JAMES Level playing field now, my ratty little friend.
NIKI Let's see where we are at the end of lap one.
NIKI calls after JAMES as he walks to his car...
NIKI Let's see where we are in six races time!!
JAMES turns, makes a ratty face at NIKI.
Protruding teeth.
RICHARD BURTON and LIZ TAYLOR are shown into the VIP area of the paddock.
They take their seats.
LIZ TAYLOR Will this take very long?
An OFFICIAL introduces BURTON to various people - among them
OFFICIAL Richard Burton...Suzy Miller, also known as Mrs. James Hunt.
BURTON Who?
There it is.
The deep, dark, sonorous Welsh baritone voice...scarred by alcohol and cigarettes...
SUZY James Hunt.
SUZY One of the racers.
BURTON Forgive me.
BURTON Richard.
BURTON Also known as Mr. Elizabeth Taylor.
He indicates LIZ who is deeply bored..
LIZ TAYLOR What does a girl have to do to get a drink around here?
SUZY smiles.
Their eyes meet.
And no eyes are more beautiful than SUZY's.
An immediate connection between them.
Their hands hold a fraction too long as they shake...
NIKI's car roars past the finishing line first.
JAMES closely behind...
JAMES and NIKI are on the podium together...
JAMES My car wasn't right today.
JAMES Next time I'll have you..
NIKI Yeah, yeah...
JAMES's car takes the chequered flag, finishing first!!!
In the pits: TEDDY MAYER, ALASTAIR CALDWELL and JOHN HOGAN leap to their feet in delight.
Punching the air.
Victory..
Afterwards: JAMES and NIKI are on the podium together...
JAMES What did I tell you?
JAMES Car fixed.
JAMES Equal terms.
JAMES You'd better get used to this.
JAMES walks off, to celebrate with the McLaren team...
NIKI stares darkly - threatened - watching JAMES go..
...then goes to talk to LUCA DE MONTEZEMOLO and the FERRARI team.
A huge furore as several OFFICIALS and FERRARI TEAM MEMBERS, and TV CREWS surround JAMES's car...
Raised voices debating the width of the car, HUNT furious, people almost coming to blows...
OFFICIAL The car is too wide..
JAMES Five eighths of an inch..!
OFFICIAL Which makes it illegal!
OFFICIAL If you want to compete, you have to change it.
JAMES What?
JAMES You can't just `change it'.
JAMES That means rebuilding the car.
JAMES Who lodged the complaint?
JAMES It was Ferrari, wasn't it?
The two rival PIT CREWS, (McLaren and Ferrari), scream abuse at one another in Italian and English - a highly charged and explosive atmosphere....
NIKI watches from the inside of the FERRARI TRAILER.
The McLaren MECHANICS, supervised by Alastair Caldwell, are making adjustments to the car to make it `legal'..
MAYER ...we have to move the wing forward.
MAYER To make it legal...
CALDWELL But that'll have a knock-on effect on the oil coolers..
JAMES watches - already fearing the worst - as the car is stripped down, effectively being rebuilt...
"BANG", JAMES's car shudders violently, the wheels shake as the drive shaft snaps...
"BOOM", a loud explosion.
A thick plume of black smoke billows from the engine...
JAMES No!
JAMES No!
JAMES No!
"CRASH" - JAMES spins out...and a tyre bounces along the track...JAMES's car has crashed into a wall...
JAMES I can't stand it...
The tyre continues bouncing, people diving out of it's path, before the tyre finally smashes into a hot-dog stand...
JAMES storms back into the pits, screaming at MAYER, CALDWELL and the MECHANICS...
JAMES What's happened?
JAMES What have you DONE??
JAMES The car's evil!
JAMES It's undriveable..!
Later: the victorious NIKI, wearing the garland, is all smiles, giving `winner' interviews, surrounded by MARLENE and a delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO.
JAMES is also giving interviews, but in a total fury.
Vibrating with anger.
Still complaining about the disqualification.
Complaining about a conspiracy.
Complaining.
NIKI finishes talking to JOURNALISTS, and walks off, through crowds, and bumps into JAMES..
NIKI So...six races in.
NIKI How's it going so far?
JAMES Fine!
JAMES Just got a little problem with a bad loser rat and his team of Italian saboteurs who've destroyed my car.
NIKI What are you talking about?
JAMES I won that race in Spain.
JAMES And you know it.
NIKI In an illegal car.
JAMES The aerofoil was five eighths of an inch too long!!
JAMES Something that doesn't have the slightest effect on car speed.
JAMES You complained.
JAMES Now we've had to totally rebuild the car and it's become a monster.
NIKI At least it's a LEGAL monster.
JAMES A car that was beating you week in week out, so you have to resort to this.
JAMES Cheating.
NIKI He drives in an illegal car and he
calls ME the cheat?
Let me tell you: two weeks before that race in Spain, we put 20-inch rims on the rear wheels.
We get an extra half second speed on each lap!!
But the Old Man tells me we can't use those rims, they make the car too wide.
Against the rules.
So we go back to 19-inch rims making the car slower again.
Rules are rules.
For all of us.
You're just a bad loser who can't accept that.
Komm, he's crazy.
Sick in the head.
NIKI turns to MARLENE, speaks in German...
NIKI Den Trottel lassen wir alleine..
NIKI (Let's go.
NIKI Leave this jerk alone.)
NIKI No wonder she left him...
NIKI and MARLENE go.
JAMES is left staring.
Not understanding.
JAMES walks into the crowded MCLAREN pits.
Sees TEDDY MAYER and ALASTAIR CALDWELL...
JAMES Is there something I should know about Suzy?
JAMES Where is she?
JAMES Wasn't she supposed to be here today?
CALDWELL nervously indicates the Sunday newspapers...
CALDWELL We kept it from you.
CALDWELL Didn't want to tell you before the race...
JAMES looks at the newspapers, then his expression changes.
Lurid headlines about SUZY HUNT in New York with RICHARD BURTON.
Pictures all over the front pages of RICHARD BURTON, ELIZABETH TAYLOR, SUZY and JAMES.
JAMES's face falls..
JAMES Jesus.
A jumbo jet roars down the runway and takes off...
The unmistakable skyline.
Among the ten thousand craggy rooftops and skyscrapers...
A grand, five-star hotel overlooking Central Park in Manhattan's mid-town district...
A huge collection of paparazzi SNAPPERS and Journalist HACKS is camped outside the hotel.
Immediately a surge of activity, "Here he is"...
A burst of flashlights and a volley of questions from the JOURNALISTS as JAMES - gets out of the taxi and runs the gauntlet of humiliation...
...into the hotel..
A large hotel suite.
There are flowers everywhere.
Newspapers are all over the table.
JAMES sits opposite SUZY.
He sees an expensive gift; recently opened.
A diamond necklace..
JAMES That from him?
SUZY nods.
Even the uninitiated eye can tell: it's worth a fortune.
SUZY Why have you come here, James?
JAMES To get you back.
SUZY You don't want me back...you never wanted to be married in the first place.
SUZY You did it because you hoped it might change you...settle you down...
SUZY help with the racing.
SUZY Not because you loved me.
SUZY And who knows, if it had been just the drinking, or the dope, or the infidelity, or the moods...it might even have worked...but when it's all of them?
JAMES I know.
JAMES I'm terrible.
SUZY No, you're not terrible.
SUZY You're just...who you are...at this point in your life.
SUZY And God help anyone that wants more.
JAMES Will he be able to give you more?
JAMES He has quite the bad boy reputation himself.
SUZY What's important is how it feels to me.
SUZY And it feels like he adores me.
A flicker behind JAMES's eyes.
Failure.
JAMES Right.
SUZY He's aware of the delicacy of the situation, and how it looks.
SUZY Having raided your larder.
SUZY Plundered your safe.
SUZY Smash and grab, and so forth.
SUZY So he's assured me he'll take care of the financial side.
SUZY And will be very generous.
JAMES manages a brave smile.
JAMES Fine.
JAMES I'll give him a call.
SUZY No.
SUZY His lawyers will contact you.
JAMES notices the vast unmade bed.
Where, until recently, two people had slept.
JAMES emerges from the hotel - into the storm of paparazzi again.
He manages a brave smile...
JAMES It's all very amicable.
JAMES My wife has found herself a new backer...I mean lover...which makes her happy..
JAMES Mr. Burton has found a way of feeling young again...let's hope his pockets are deep...they'll need to be...
JAMES And I've found a way to be single again without it costing me a penny, which has to go down as the biggest win of my career.
Laughter from the JOURNALISTS who are hungrily writing down the copy.
But JAMES's hollow smile fools no one...
JAMES sits alone in the first class section.
A loser on the track, and a loser in love, too.
Being played out in the full glare of publicity.
On the front pages.
Being read by everyone on the plane.
A STEWARDESS looks over, catches his eye.
Smiles.
JAMES and the STEWARDESS fucking.
Hard.
Nothing to do with pleasure.
An analgesic - a way of blocking out the pain.
JAMES catches his own reflection in the mirror.
Teeth clenched.
Eyes burning with anger and self-loathing...
OVER THIS: we fade in the ROAR of car engines...
JAMES's teeth still clenched.
Eyes still burning with anger.
Driving flat out.
At the limit.
Suzy's words still ringing in his ears.
Make that beyond the limit.
At the point of no return.
The car shaking.
Weaving recklessly through other cars...
Where death has become a real option.
Because he doesn't care anymore.
Because it's all he deserves anyway...
And in that moment, in reaching his lowest point, JAMES has unwittingly stumbled on the one thing that gives him an advantage over everyone else...
The fact that he doesn't care.
The fact that death has become an option.
The fact that there is no risk he is not prepared to take...
So every corner is tighter, every braking point later, every gap is an opening, no matter how tiny...
The chequered flag waves as JAMES's car roars across the finish line...
JAMES screams with released rage....
CAPTION: "RACE 7.
HUNT WINS.
LAUDA's ENGINE BLOWS UP"
Afterwards: TEDDY MAYER, ALASTAIR CALDWELL and JOHN HOGAN celebrate in delight...cheering...
NIKI's car is pursued by JAMES's.
They disappear behind a copse of trees.
Out of sight.
When they re-emerge, JAMES is ahead of NIKI, having overtaken him - to the delight of the partisan crowd.
The chequered flag waves again as JAMES's car roars across the finish line...
CAPTION: "RACE 8.
HUNT WINS.
LAUDA 2nd."
JAMES screams in catharsis and triumph.
Teeth clenched.
Eyes wide and staring with concentration.
We notice SCREAMING GIRL FANS cheering him now.
A blazer-wearing FIA OFFICIAL addresses a room full of sports and motoring JOURNALISTS, TV CREWS, etc...
FIA OFFICIAL Following an inquiry into the disqualification of driver James Hunt from the Spanish Grand Prix, it has been decided to overturn this disqualification...and to restore his victory, and reinstate his points..
JAMES, TEDDY MAYER, ALASTAIR CALDWELL, and all the MECHANICS are watching on TV...
Huge celebrations.
Cheering and whooping.
SCREAMING GIRLS.
A crowded PRESS room.
In opposite corners of the room, JAMES and NIKI are giving interviews to different PRESS and TV journalists.
Stirling Moss is talking to JAMES...
STIRLING MOSS ...James, a few weeks ago, you were out of the running for this season completely, now you're right back in it.
STIRLING MOSS What's changed...?
Screaming GIRLS in the background, shouting "James, we love you."
JAMES stares across the room at NIKI...
JAMES A combination of factors, not all of which I'm prepared to discuss here.
JAMES Justice being done re: the disqualification in Spain helps, and having my old car back of course...
In the other corner: NIKI is doing his interviews in German, (we see sub-titles)...
JOURNALIST Mathematically in theory it's now possible for Hunt to catch you.
JOURNALIST Are you worried?
NIKI Not at all.
NIKI For him to catch me, he'd have to win all the remaining races, and I'd have to lose them.
NIKI And pigs would have to fly.
Laughter among the confident GERMANS.
NIKI Now if you'll excuse me, I have a private family matter to attend to.
NIKI takes MARLENE's hand, and leads her away.
To establish: the Viennese skyline.
NIKI and MARLENE get married.
In stark contrast to JAMES's wedding...it's a small, intimate affair.
Modest.
Not showy.
Away from the cameras.
Just them.
And a witness from the pub.
A small aeroplane takes off...
NIKI and an INSTRUCTOR are in the plane.
In the cockpit.
With MARLENE, who watches...
NIKI is learning to fly.
MARLENE watches as NIKI soaks up the instruction, asking questions, happy.
It's another side to him, completely.
NIKI and MARLENE in a pool.
In Ibiza.
Playing.
Laughing.
Honeymooning.
Then NIKI's expression changes.
His smile fades.
MARLENE is fast asleep.
She wakes, to discover the bed is empty beside her..
MARLENE walks through the house, looking for NIKI.
Then finds him on a balcony...alone..
MARLENE Come to bed.
MARLENE notices his mood.
It's different.
MARLENE What's the matter?
NIKI It's the enemy, you know.
NIKI Happiness.
NIKI looks up at MARLENE...
NIKI It weakens you.
NIKI Puts doubt in your mind.
NIKI Because all of a sudden you have something to lose..
MARLENE stares at him.
MARLENE When you call happiness an enemy, then it's too late.
MARLENE Then you have lost already.
MARLENE turns, and goes..
NIKI is left alone.
We can tell from his expression, he is struggling with something for the first time.
Fear.
The notoriously difficult and treacherous German race track.
Testing is underway.
A CAR (from one of the other teams) skids, and crashes violently.
AMBULANCES arrive.
The Driver is badly hurt.
Screaming in pain.
His leg is crushed.
Bone is sticking out.
A brutal compound fracture.
He is taken away.
In the pits, everyone is shaken.
JAMES, REGAZZONI, and other DRIVERS nervously talk among themselves as the Ambulance races past.
NIKI's face: visibly pale.
More frightened than ever.
Race-day.
Huge crowds arrive at the Nurburgring.
And rain.
Heavy rain falling.
Television commentary informs us about the Nurburgring's terrible reputation as a `graveyard' track.
JAMES arrives at the race track, to find ALASTAIR CALDWELL waiting for him, a concerned look on his face...
CALDWELL We've just been told, a driver's meeting has been called.
JAMES Who by?
CALDWELL Niki.
JAMES's face.
Instantly suspicious.
About sixty people, (26 DRIVERS and all the different team REPRESENTATIVES), are assembled in the room, where a blazered FIA OFFICIAL and a member of the DRIVERS SAFETY COMMITTEE are sitting behind a table...
A buzz of anticipation and curiosity.
What's going on?
What is all this about?
NIKI gets to his feet, raises his hands calling for silence...
NIKI Thank you.
NIKI I called this meeting because as all drivers know the Nurburgring is a race track from the Stone Ages.
NIKI The most stupid, barbaric, outdated, dangerous, track in the world.
NIKI You've all seen the rain which has been falling this morning.
NIKI Those of you with experience know the Ring needs perfect conditions to be even remotely acceptable in terms of risk.
NIKI As you can see today is anything BUT perfect, so I called this meeting to take a vote to cancel the race.
A ripple of astonished reactions among the drivers..
NIKI There would be no change to the situation as far as points is concerned.
NIKI The race would simply be cancelled.
TEDDY MAYER looks over at FERRARI representatives....
MAYER This is bullshit...
Another DRIVER (GUY EDWARDS) gets to his feet...
EDWARDS If the race is cancelled, none of us get our race fees...
NIKI It's true.
NIKI You leave without your fee, but you might leave with your LIFE.
Another voice pierces the controversy...
VOICE It also means you would effectively win the championship.
It's JAMES HUNT, who is standing up...
JAMES So I can see why this suits you just fine.
NIKI Why?
NIKI There would be no points for me either...
JAMES But there would be one race less where I, or anyone else, could catch you.
Uproar in the room...
BRETT LUNGER James is right!
BRETT LUNGER This is just tactics!
ARTURO MERZARIO Ferrari's dirty tricks!
ARTURO MERZARIO We've seen it before!
HARALD ERTL Maybe it's just that he's frightened?
Laughter among the DRIVERS...
NIKI Which asshole said this?
Silence.
No hand goes up.
No one has the courage to own up.
NIKI Yes, I am frightened.
NIKI Always a little bit when I race.
NIKI I accept every time I get in my car there is 20% chance that I could die.
NIKI But not one per cent more.
NIKI And today, with the rain the risk IS more.
NIKI How dare you accuse me of lack of courage?
NIKI Let me remind you.
NIKI I have the track record here.
NIKI I am the only person in history to do the Ring in under 7 minutes.
NIKI So actually it's to my ADVANTAGE to race here today.
NIKI Because I'm quicker than all of you.
A stunned silence.
One voice pierces the room...
JAMES Fine.
JAMES Then let's race!
It's JAMES who stares at NIKI: a ripple of excitement and enthusiasm among the other drivers...
JAMES There's a hundred thousand fans out there who would never forgive us if we didn't.
MERZARIO And some of us need our race fees!!
FIA OFFICIAL All those in favour of cancelling the race?
NIKI puts his hand up.
One or two other racers, too...
FIA OFFICIAL All those in favour of racing?
JAMES puts his hand up.
Clearly the more popular, charismatic figure among the DRIVERS, everyone else follows.
FIA OFFICIAL Gentlemen, start your engines!!
A clear victory for JAMES.
He has swung the room.
Everyone leaves the room.
JAMES and TEDDY MAYER give one another a discreet hi-five...
But we rack focus through the crowd to see NIKI staring at JAMES accusingly...holding his gaze.
"RRRROAAAR", an explosion of noise, as we widen and find ourselves on the starting grid of the German Grand Prix.
An OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One Minute"...
Deafening, angry thunder, as cars rev their engines.
A pupil dilates and contracts in the light.
The eye stares.
Blinks.
Thinks.
Making evaluations..
This time the eye belongs to JAMES.
He stares up at the clouds.
His eyelids flicker.
Thinking.
Agonizing.
Wrestling with an all important decision...
Is it going to carry on raining?
Or become dry?
ALASTAIR CALDWELL comes up to JAMES, and shouts above the noise - no time to plug his headset in...
CALDWELL Jochen's going on slicks.
CALDWELL You want to change?
JAMES looks in his wing-mirror back to his colleague, JOCHEN MASS's car, number 12, several rows behind him.
White helmet.
A team of Mclaren MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to bald, dry tyres - ('slicks').
Then JAMES looks over at the car beside him...
JAMES Has Niki changed?
CALDWELL No.
CALDWELL He's going on wets.
NIKI's car: surrounded by Italian Ferrari MECHANICS.
JAMES Then we go on wets, too.
JAMES pulls down his visor...as he and NIKI's eyes meet for a split-second, then...
The STARTER waves the flag.
They're off!
JAMES's foot hits the floor - his engine screams at almost 9,000 rpms, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.
The car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..
JAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck, but within seconds there's a McLaren right behind them, gaining fast.
JAMES realizes it's his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white helmet.
Number 12.
On his slick tyres.
MASS was right to gamble on the track drying out.
JAMES curses under his breath...
JAMES Shit...!
JAMES screwed up.
Made the wrong decision.
He urgently needs to change tyres.
With barely one lap completed...
He swerves angrily into the pits..
Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the crazy, panicked situation as JAMES comes into the pits to change to dry tyres.
The McLaren team frantically changes the tyres.
Four men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks.
ALASTAIR CALDWELL appears, talks to JAMES..
CALDWELL See?
CALDWELL I told you to go on slicks!!
CALDWELL You didn't take my advice...
JAMES Shut up!
JAMES Where's Niki?
CALDWELL Behind you!
CALDWELL He made the same mistake!
JAMES looks in his mirror to see NIKI's red helmet behind him in the pits, then...
"Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac.
JAMES gets the signal, `Clear!'
CALDWELL Go!
CALDWELL Go!!
CALDWELL Go!!
JAMES's foot hits the floor.
He roars out, with new tyres, leaving NIKI behind him in the pits...
Archive commentary: from the world's TV stations informs us that JAMES roars up into 3rd position..
JAMES gives it everything he's got.
Tearing through the gears, breaking as late as he can, engine screaming.
The world flies past in a blur.
The steering wheel shakes.
The car cannot be driven any harder.
No thought for safety.
No thought of failure..
Failure is unimaginable.
Unconscionable.
He turns into the final straight, then stops when he sees something ahead.
Flags.
Red flags.
RACE MARSHALLS.
Something has clearly happened.
An accident..
The race is being stopped.
JAMES brakes, slowing down.
He pulls level with a uniformed MARSHALL..
JAMES What's up?
MARSHALL Accident.
MARSHALL Bad one.
JAMES Who?
MARSHALL We don't know yet.
NIKI's POV: a continuation of the opening scene.
Burning smoke fills NIKI's helmet, burning his lungs.
He cries out in agony.
We can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards him, as their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo his seatbelt...
We notice it is the same DRIVERS that were critical of NIKI in the driver's meeting.
HARALD ERTL, BRETT LUNGER, ARTURO
Fire extinguishers blast at the car.
Covering NIKI's helmet.
Filling his lungs with chemicals, along with the smoke and fumes, blurring his vision, as he screams horribly..
The sound of panicked TV COMMENTARY in different languages.
Screaming voices.
Panicked reactions.
Then sound fades.
As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.
OVER THIS: the hypnotic sound of helicopter blades...
NIKI (V/O) August 1st, 1976, I discovered comas exist for a reason.
NIKI's POV: the door to a helicopter opens, as it arrives at Mannheim University Hospital...
The sound of shouting voices.
Hospital STAFF pull reach towards NIKI, pull his stretcher out.
NIKI's internal voice groans: cries out at the pain.
NIKI (V/O) Some things are better not remembered.
"Crash", doors burst open and NIKI is rushed into emergency.
Neon ceiling lights pass overhead...
The sound of difficult breathing.
His stretcher is surrounded by DOCTORS, talking urgently, making quick assessments..
NIKI's POV: fading in and out of consciousness.
Bursts of concerned, urgent, overlapping dialogue among the German DOCTORS which NIKI can barely make out..
Two narrow, barely open slits of light.
NIKI's swollen eye- lids.
NIKI's POV: barely making out MARLENE standing beside the senior burns specialist DOCTOR.
NIKI hears voices...
DOCTOR It's not the burns to his face that are the danger.
DOCTOR It's the burns to his lungs.
DOCTOR His blood oxygen level is currently...
DOCTOR Which is not enough to maintain life...
NIKI slips out of consciousness again.
MARLENE is distraught, in tears.
TV news: giving the latest information on NIKI's condition.
JAMES sits watching the news on TV in his apartment, while feeding his budgerigars, (the collection has grown)..
He feels terrible.
He goes to his desk, pulls out paper and pen...
JAMES tries to find the right words, tries to write, tries to put his feelings on paper, but words in general, and letters in particular have never been his thing...
JAMES scrunches up the pieces of paper, throws it away.
The budgerigars, sensing his distress, flutter and peep..
NIKI's P.O.V: feels someone touching his forehead and his hands with oil...and the sound of a WOMAN weeping...
PRIEST ...durch diese heilige Salbung helfe dir der Herr in seinem reichen Erbarmen, er stehe dir bei mit der Kraft des Heiligen Geistes...
NIKI's eyes barely crack open, barely manage to focus to see an ELDERLY PRIEST is giving him the last rites in German..
The sound of MARLENE crying somewhere in the room.
PRIEST Der Herr der dich von Sunden befreit, rette dich in seiner Gnade richte er dich auf...
NIKI strains to move.
A sense of excruciating pain.
He fights to open his eyes, give an indication...ANY indication of the fact that he is hearing this, and is alive and able to fight for life...
But to no avail.
The PRIEST continues giving last rites.
MARLENE continues to cry.
The PRIEST touches NIKI's shoulder...
NIKI (V/O) I'm here!
NIKI (V/O) Can't you tell?
NIKI (V/O) I'm here!
NIKI screams inside.
Wanting to be heard.
Wanting to give them a sign.
He's OK.
He's still there.
But it's no use.
NIKI blacks out again.
The pain is too great.
Sunrise: MARLENE has been sitting in the hospital all night supported by members of FAMILY and several FRIENDS.
Niki's MOTHER and FATHER.
CLAY REGAZZONI.
Presently: the door to the intensive care unit opens and a DOCTOR comes out, beckoning her...
DOCTOR Frau Lauda?
DOCTOR Bitte kommen Sie!
DOCTOR He's awake!
DOCTOR And just spoke!
MARLENE scrambles to her feet...
MARLENE What did he say?
DOCTOR "Tell the Priest to fuck off!
DOCTOR I'm still alive!!"
MARLENE covers her mouth, laughs nervously, already in tears.
She and the DOCTOR rush into the intensive care unit.
Shooting through the window we see MARLENE approach NIKI's bed.
She sees NIKI..
And gasps.
Trying to control her expression.
Not give away to him how horrified she is.
NIKI's face: is grotesque.
His head has swollen to double it's size.
The skin has burned off on his head, his eyes.
MARLENE bravely composes herself.
Then, without displaying the shock she feels - she goes over and kisses him.
The starter's flag drops.
On television we see the Austrian Grand Prix start.
NIKI watches the race on television, while beginning his rehab in bed, in pain as bandages are changed..
ON TV: JAMES narrowly misses out on a podium, but still gains on NIKI in his points total...
CAPTION: "RACE 11.
HUNT FINISHES 4th"
NIKI continues his rehab in the hospital, now out of bed...
ON TV: the starter's flag drops.
Another Grand Prix starts.
This time at Zandvoort, in the Netherlands..
NIKI watches the race on television as DOCTORS put a vacuuum pump into his lungs.
It's AGONY.
JAMES leads, driving the perfect race...
YOUNG GERMAN DOCTOR We need to vacuum the lungs.
YOUNG GERMAN DOCTOR Without this, they can't heal.
YOUNG GERMAN DOCTOR But it will hurt.
An unimaginably painful pump is forced down his burned lungs, to try to hoover out the impurities..
COMMENTATORS ON TV: talk about how HUNT is catching up with LAUDA on points.
It spurs NIKI on, through gritted teeth.
NIKI Aaarrrggghhhh...
The chequered flag.
JAMES crosses the line in first position.
The DOCTORS tell NIKI he's had enough vacuum treatment.
He's had more than enough pain.
But NIKI waves them aside...
NIKI Again!!
The DOCTOR nods.
The vacuum is turned on again.
NIKI screams in agony.
Eyes bulging.
MARLENE and NIKI's family cannot bear to watch...
He watches as ON TV: JAMES is on the victory podium spraying champagne.
NIKI continues screaming in pain, watching the Canadian GP on TV as..
For the first time, JAMES has taken the lead in points.
NIKI stares at the TV: his expression changes.
NIKI screams again.
MARLENE, NIKI's family and the DOCTORS are deeply distressed, cannot bring themselves to watch, as...
NIKI Aaaaarrrrggghghhhhhh!!
We WIDEN to reveal what NIKI is doing.
What has caused these unbearable, bloodcurdling screams of agony..
NIKI I know what you're all thinking...
Now we see.
With great difficulty NIKI has put his racing helmet on for the first time.
Pressing into his open burn wounds...
NIKI But if you love me - all of you - you won't say a word.
He is almost unconscious with pain.
His legs are weak.
But he has done it...
The Italian Grand Prix.
TELEVISION COMMENTARY sets the scene.
JAMES and the MCLAREN TEAM arrive in the pits to see a vast commotion going on elsewhere...
JAMES What's going on?
CALDWELL Jesus.
CALDWELL It's Niki.
JAMES What about him?
CALDWELL He's here!
CALDWELL He's racing!
JAMES What??
JAMES They said he was half-dead.
JAMES stares.
Shaken.
JAMES pushes through the pitlanes, until he reaches the crowded FERRARI pits.
He sees a racer in the background.
The name LAUDA on his overalls...
JAMES Niki?
NIKI turns round.
JAMES sets eyes on him for the first time.
JAMES reels, visibly horrified by his appearance.
His bandages are blood stained.
He has no hair.
Looks grotesque..
NIKI sees the horror in JAMES's face.
Sees the shock.
The horror.
And recognizes in that moment, this is how it's going to be - this is how people will respond to him - forever.
NIKI Wow.
NIKI It's that bad, huh?
JAMES opens his mouth.
Tries to say something.
NIKI In the hospital I told them to tell me straight, no bullshit - how bad it would be.
NIKI My appearance.
NIKI They said with time it'd be fine.
NIKI But it won't.
NIKI I can tell, seeing your reaction.
NIKI I am going to spend the rest of my life with a face that frightens people.
NIKI stares at JAMES, at his rival's beauty, his blonde, tanned perfection.
His matinee idol, movie star looks...
NIKI That's a tough one to get used to.
JAMES I wrote you a letter at the time.
JAMES To apologize.
JAMES (contid) The driver's meeting in Germany?
JAMES (contid) Before the race?
JAMES (contid) I swayed the room.
NIKI Yes.
NIKI You did.
JAMES That race should never have gone ahead.
NIKI No.
JAMES So in some ways...I feel responsible for what happened.
JAMES I'm sorry.
NIKI Trust me, watching you win those points and all those races while I was in hospital fighting for my life...you were equally responsible for getting me better.
Ouch.
That could have been meant generously.
But in this case it wasn't.
It was a cold slap in the face.
NIKI turns and goes.
A packed press conference.
The world's media.
NIKI's accident and recovery (as a story) has reached way beyond F1 race fans.
This is front page news around the globe..
NIKI walks out onto the podium - all eyes staring at him - the sense of a ghoulish, voyeuristic freak show....
NIKI sits on the podium, in front of microphones, flanked on both sides by FERRARI drivers and top brass.
But no one wants to talk to them.
Everyone's here to talk to NIKI..
JAPANESE JOURNALIST How are you feeling, Niki?
NIKI Fine.
AMERICAN JOURNALIST Can you confirm for us exactly which procedures you have had?
AMERICAN JOURNALIST And the expectations for your recovery?
NIKI Sure.
NIKI I had a skin graft operation where they put half my right thigh in my face.
NIKI It doesn't look too good but one unexpected advantage is it's impossible to perspire through a skin graft, so sweat will never run in my eyes again - which is good for a driver.
Laughter.
At the back of the hall, JAMES HUNT creeps in, (unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen.
BRAZILIAN JOURNALIST When they heard about your condition, Ferrari immediately hired another driver, Carlos Reutemann.
NIKI Ja.
NIKI Before even my first operation.
JAPANESE JOURNALIST Is he your replacement now?
NIKI No.
NIKI Just another team-mate.
NIKI Keen to make an impression.
NIKI So let's see where Mr. Reutemann finishes today.
Laughter.
JAPANESE JOURNALIST James Hunt and McLaren have caught up a lot while you were away.
NIKI Yes.
NIKI Is there a question now?
NIKI Or are you just trying to piss me off?
Laughter.
JAPANESE JOURNALIST You think you can still win?
NIKI Of course.
NIKI I have the better car.
NIKI I'm the better driver.
NIKI But he's a clever guy and has used the time well while I was lying half-dead in hospital to win some points..
Laughter.
BRITISH JOURNALIST What did your wife say when she saw your face?
NIKI She said, "Sweetie, you don't need a face to drive.
NIKI Only a right foot."
Laughter.
BRITISH JOURNALIST I'm being serious.
BRITISH JOURNALIST Do you really think your marriage can survive?
BRITISH JOURNALIST With the way you look now?
Silence.
NIKI squints into the lights..
NIKI And I'm being serious, too.
NIKI Which asshole said this?
NIKI Jesus..
No one moves.
NIKI, disgusted, rips off his microphone..
NIKI Fuck you.
NIKI Press conference over.
NIKI walks out.
The Press Conference breaks up...
JAMES sees the REPORTER who asked the question, laughing with his friends.
JAMES watches as the REPORTER leaves...
JAMES goes after the REPORTER, and calls him..
JAMES Hey..!
The REPORTER turns, recognizes JAMES..
JAMES I've got something for you on that last question...
The BRITISH JOURNALIST smiles, "Great, thanks James!" Pulls out a tape recorder.
JAMES takes him to one side, then...
"WHACK, WHACK, WHACK" - JAMES punches his lights out, then takes the tape recorder, stuffs it into the JOURNALISTS mouth.
JAMES Now go home to your wife and ask her how YOU look!!
"CRASH" a final, sickening blow splits the REPORTER's nose..
JAMES Prick!
JAMES walks out to his car.
TV CREWS.
Banks of PHOTOGRAPHERS.
Commentators talk in different languages.
Everyone talking about NIKI's comeback.
NIKI is in his car.
The MECHANICS are talking to him in Italian...
But NIKI hears nothing.
He looks at the steering wheel, the shell of the car, the gear stick.
And then we see..
His hands are shaking violently.
He's utterly terrified.
The light turns green.
They're off!
Other cars (including JAMES's), roar forward.
But NIKI is frozen.
NIKI's mind is a mess - terrified - he starts slowly...finding his courage..
COMMENTATORS point out it's madness.
It was clearly too soon.
Ferrari were right to hire a replacement.
NIKI is a wreck..
NIKI suffers terrible flashbacks from his accident...
NIKI shakes himself out...gradually building up speed - ignoring the cars overtaking him all around him...
NIKI begins to accelerate.
Gently at first.
Then a bit more.
Trusting himself.
Gaining confidence..
Blocking out further flashbacks...
Watching NIKI from the hospital where he had his treatment is the DOCTOR who treated him...
COMMENTATORS look up.
Notice NIKI's slow increase in speed.
What's this?
Maybe there's life in him yet...
NIKI changes gears smoothly.
He begins to overtake.
The old feelings come back..
MARLENE watches from the pits.
Can hardly bring herself to look...
COMMENTATORS begin to get excited.
LAUDA has started to overtake the back-markers...
An incredible sequence.
As NIKI gains more confidence, more speed, and begins to work his way through the field..
COMMENTATORS now buzzing with excitement.
This is incredible, as NIKI overtakes first CARLOS REUTEMANN, the driver hired to replace him, then others, working his way through the field...
JAMES sees NIKI coming up behind him.
Cannot believe his eyes.
JAMES move to block NIKI's path...
NIKI attacks fearlessly.
Despite terrible pain.
NIKI moves to overtake JAMES.
Utterly intimidated by NIKI's bravery, JAMES panics, and loses control of the car.
He spins out..
COMMENTATORS cannot believe their eyes.
HUNT's blown it!
LAUDA's overtaken him!
It's a miracle.
It defies belief.
As NIKI crosses the line....
CAPTION: "RACE 15.
NIKI 4th.
JAMES RETIRED."
The Italian crowds are ecstatic.
Delirious.
NIKI is a national hero.
Lazarus back from the dead.
Superhuman.
TV commentary in different languages elaborates on what an extraordinary, superhuman achievement they have just seen...
STIRLING MOSS What a race!
STIRLING MOSS What a man!
STIRLING MOSS What a season!
STIRLING MOSS Now it all boils down to the final race in Japan!
Hunt walks past, staring at a triumphant Niki.
The DOCTOR in the hospital shakes his head, cannot believe what he has just witnessed...
The Ferrari Mechanics that had initially so disliked NIKI, are overwhelmed by what he has achieved...
A reluctant, modest NIKI carried on shoulders, surrounded by LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO, MARLENE and the PRESS...
Mount Fuji towers imperiously, dramatically above the Japanese race track, dominating the skyline on a clear day..
Television cameras and press photographers assemble at the race track for the biggest sporting event of the year...
JAMES sits alone in his hotel suite.
Speaking to an old, trusted friend at the other end...
JAMES (ON PHONE) The man was in a coma.
JAMES (ON PHONE) His doctors pronounced him dead!!
JAMES (ON PHONE) Then he comes back and does THAT???
BUBBLES HORSLEY back at home in England.
At a breakfast table..
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) What did you expect?
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) That Niki would give you the championship lying down?
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) Of course not.
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) He's a fighter.
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) He's going to come at you with everything he's got.
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) But you can do this.
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) As a driver, you're his equal - better, maybe.
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) And God knows you're quick and brave enough.
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) You just..
JAMES (ON PHONE) What?
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) Need to find the respect for yourself to close out when it really matters.
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) You don't much like yourself, James - that's the problem, therefore don't believe you deserve it.
A knock at JAMES's hotel room door..
JAMES I've got to go.
JAMES hangs up, and goes to the door.
He snaps it open to reveal..
Two gorgeous-looking BOAC Stewardesses standing outside.
Smart blue blazers, short skirts, white gloves, blue caps..
STEWARDESS Hi.
STEWARDESS We've come for the party?
JAMES What party?
STEWARDESS The party we were told was going on in room 2109.
Sure enough: on JAMES's door, the number 2109.
JAMES Who sent you here?
STEWARDESS A man.
STEWARDESS On the phone.
STEWARDESS He didn't give his name.
JAMES This man.
JAMES Did he speak with an accent?
STEWARDESS Yes.
STEWARDESS German accent.
JAMES can't believe it.
NIKI.
JAMES I'm afraid it was a joke..
STEWARDESS Awwww.
STEWARDESS Pity.
JAMES Sorry, ladies.
JAMES Any other time.
JAMES Not tonight.
JAMES closes the door.
Goes back into his hotel room.
Then, after a moment...
He snaps open the door.
The STEWARDESSES are about to disappear into the elevator...
JAMES Wait..!
The following morning, day barely breaks.
The skies are ominously dark over Tokyo.
Thick, black clouds.
It's raining heavily...
NIKI wakes up and looks out of the window.
Sees the heavy rain which is falling outside...
His expression changes.
JAMES wakes up.
Flinches.
JAMES looks around, bleary-eyed.
Hungover.
He's in a room that looks like a bomb has hit it.
The two STEWARDESSES are still asleep in the bed beside him.
Uniforms discarded on the floor.
Memories are now flooding back.
Jesus, what was he THINKING?
JAMES leaps out of bed.
NIKI is being massaged by WILLI DUNGL in his hotel room in preparation for the race.
NIKI continues to stare out of the window.
They speak in German.
We see sub-titles..
NIKI Can't see the mountain.
DUNGL So?
NIKI The locals here believe if you can see the mountain in the morning, it brings good luck.
NIKI's POV: the view.
Nothing but mist, dark skies and rain.
Inside the race track: puddles everywhere.
The rain continues to fall.
The circuit is covered in water...
DRIVERS and the TEAMS arrive at the race track.
JAMES and TEDDY MAYER and ALASTAIR CALDWELL among them...
SPECTATORS are huddled under umbrellas.
TV CREWS struggle to keep expensive equipment dry...
An American VOICE comes over the tannoy...
TANNOY All drivers to the control tower, please.
TANNOY Immediately.
JAMES looks at CALDWELL...
A driver's meeting has been called.
All the DRIVERS are in a small room, arguing and remonstrating with FIA OFFICIALS and blazer-wearing POWERS THAT BE...
A Japanese official, (AKIYAMA), is trying to keep the peace...
AKIYAMA One at a time!
AKIYAMA Gentlemen, please!
Local JAPANESE DRIVERS are complaining in Japanese, (we see sub-titles)...
TAKAHARA You can't send us out in that!
TAKAHARA It's a death sentence!
HASEMI You have to postpone the race!
JAMES, MAYER and CALDWELL arrive in a corridor outside the meeting room...
MAYER Niki's talking to them about cancelling the race.
JAMES's POV: he can see NIKI, his wounds horribly visible, remonstrating with the JAPANESE OFFICIAL about the dangerous track conditions...
JAMES turns to TEDDY and ALASTAIR...
JAMES I don't want any part of this.
JAMES I'm not going to be responsible for turning the room again.
CALDWELL But you have no option.
CALDWELL You HAVE to race, James.
CALDWELL It's your only shot.
CALDWELL If you don't, Niki wins..
JAMES I'm not voting against Niki again....or forcing fellow drivers to risk their lives.
JAMES Sorry.
JAMES World Championship or not...
JAMES raises his hands and walks off.
CALDWELL shouts after him, "James, wait..!" Then MAYER reassures CALDWELL...
MAYER Don't worry, this race is going ahead.
MAYER The TV rights have been sold all around the world.
MAYER can see that a vote is taking place in the room.
Many of the drivers have their hands in the air, voting...
The JAPANESE OFFICIAL is struggling to keep order in the room.
MAYER The drivers can vote all they like.
A round of applause in the room, as the DRIVERS vote to cancel the race.
But unseen by the DRIVERS..
The FIA OFFICIALS, TV NETWORK EXECUTIVES, and the blazered POWERS THAT BE are in dark, conspiratorial discussion..
...making the decision that the race goes ahead.
NEWSCASTERS from all over the world, in several different languages, announce that a decision has been made..
The JAPANESE Grand Prix is definitely going ahead.
The drivers have been called to the starting grid...
In the pits alongside JAMES...
A series of shots of the other DRIVERS...being sent out like lambs to the slaughter...
Visibly terrified, mouthing prayers, smoking last cigarettes, meditating, crossing themselves, hands shaking..
Among them the JAPANESE DRIVERS.
All laughter gone now.
Realizing what they've got into.
Risking their lives.
Finally we come to rest on NIKI.
Strangely calm.
NIKI puts on his balaclava over his still-raw wounds, wincing with pain as he puts on his helmet..
JAMES is piggy-backed to his car by MECHANICS so his feet don't get soaked in the water pooling deep on the track.
JAMES lowers himself into a car with puddles on the seat.
He straps himself in.
ALISTAIR CALDWELL approaches with a power-drill.
Leans towards JAMES, with the screaming drill...
CALDWELL Keep still...
JAMES What are you doing???
`ZZZZ", "ZZZZ", "ZZZZ", CALDWELL drill holes in JAMES's visor.
CALDWELL To let the condensation out.
JAMES But it will also let the water in.
CALDWELL Not if you're leading.
CALDWELL stares at JAMES...
CALDWELL Trust me.
CALDWELL This race is all about the start.
CALDWELL Whoever's in front will see everything.
CALDWELL Whoever's second...
CALDWELL gestures, "Nothing"..
CALDWELL Good luck.
They shake hands.
JAMES starts the engine with a roar.
NIKI's engine replies with a loud roar.
He looks over at JAMES.
JAMES turns to face NIKI..
...as JAMES and NIKI stare at one another.
All around them, the world slows down.
Comes to a standstill.
A connection between them.
Unspoken realization of where they have both got to.
What this moment means.
For them both..
It's what they have been waiting for.
Working towards.
All this time.
NIKI raises his hand.
In a gesture only JAMES sees.
JAMES raises his in return.
A private salute.
Chivalric.
From a bygone era.
And in that moment, enemies become brothers.
Two men.
Risking their lives.
The moment's truce is broken.
They return to the task at hand.
HUNT's foot hits the floor.
NIKI's foot hits the floor...
JAMES gets the better start.
His car aquaplanes like crazy, skating over the water, totally out of control...
CALDWELL and MAYER watch from the pit wall...
CALDWELL Hold onto it, James..!
Miraculously JAMES steadies the car...
The spray from his wheels creates a curtain of mist.
The other cars are wrapped inside it...
But JAMES has a clear view ahead.
He slams his foot down..
COMMENTATOR (V/O) It's the perfect start for Hunt!
NIKI can see nothing.
Surrounded by spray, water, noise.
Other cars are spinning all around him.
It's chaos.
NIKI bravely accelerates into blindness...
COMMENTATOR (V/O) But Lauda's car is right on his tail!
COMMENTATOR (V/O) Barely visible in the spray..!
JAMES goes to a corner, then his car twitches, aquaplanes again...badly...almost losing it completely...
COMMENTATOR (V/O) Hunt turns too tightly!
COMMENTATOR (V/O) He almost lost his car right there...!
BUBBLES HORSLEY, ALEXANDER HESKETH and a number of the characters from the Hesketh Racing days are all watching...
HESKETH Concentrate, Superstar!
JAMES struggles to hold onto his car.
He steadies it, maintaining the lead.
JAMES's spray makes it impossible for NIKI to see.
NIKI can't blink his eyes...it's agony.
Half-blind, NIKI tries to overtake.
Gives it everything he's got, breaking as late as he can, tearing through the gears...
For NIKI the world flies past in a near-blind blur.
The steering wheel shakes.
The car cannot be driven any harder.
But the visibility is terrible.
The spray tears into his scarred eyes.
He is unable to see anything but...
MARLENE's beautiful face: staring at him.
Smiling tenderly.
Kissing him tenderly.
JAMES continues to race flat out.
Engine screaming.
Foot to the floor.
His car aquaplanes again...almost skidding out...
SUZY HUNT is watching on television as RICHARD BURTON talks in the background on the telephone...
SUZY Come on, James...
A sign is held up as JAMES races.
Lap 39.
But there are problems with the car.
One of the tyres...
CALDWELL God!
CALDWELL His front tyre!
CALDWELL Look!
CALDWELL It's completely frayed!
CALDWELL and TEDDY MAYER watch in horror from the pits and on TV.
They can see the shaking car..
COMMENTATOR Hunt's car has problems...it's shaking...the Englishman is definitely getting slower...
ALASTAIR CALDWELL holds up a sign....
COMMENTATOR ...with just a few laps to go, McLaren are calling for Hunt to come into the pits to change tyres...
JAMES's car roars past the pits, refusing to stop...
COMMENTATOR But Hunt is refusing!
COMMENTATOR Simply ignoring his team's orders...!
COMMENTATOR He's made the calculation that he can still hold onto the lead...!
HESKETH and BUBBLES cover their eyes.
Can't look...
BUBBLES James!!
BUBBLES What are you doing???
HESKETH I can't bear it!
Suddenly, a Ferrari in JAMES's wing mirror.
Unmistakably, even in the spray, he can see the distinctive RED HELMET...
It's NIKI.
JAMES's blood runs cold...
JAMES No!
JAMES No!
JAMES NO!!!!
JAMES tries to fend NIKI off.
Swerves this way and that.
But his wounded car is now running at seventy per cent at best...
...and disaster!!!
NIKI OVERTAKES HIM...
JAMES screams in agony and frustration.
He's lost it!
And has no one to blame but himself!
His own arrogance.
And stubbornness.
NIKI's overtaken him!
JAMES roars past.
Has finished in third place.
But that is no consolation.
NIKI has beaten him.
As far as he's concerned..
JAMES has lost.
Lost everything.
JAMES's car arrives in the pits.
In a fury.
At himself.
For refusing to listen.
What a disgrace.
What shame.
What a fool.
But he is engulfed.
JAMES gets out of his car, raging...
JAMES I'm sorry!
But TEDDY MAYER is celebrating wildly.
ALASTAIR CALDWELL, too.
The world's media descends on JAMES...
MAYER Sorry??
MAYER What are you talking about??
MAYER You did it!
JAMES What?
MAYER You WON!!
JAMES Rubbish!!
JAMES What about Niki??
JAMES He overtook me!!
JAMES I saw it!!
JAMES A Ferrari with a red helmet..
MAYER That wasn't Niki.
MAYER That was Regazzoni.
JAMES What???
MAYER Niki withdrew.
MAYER Said it was too dangerous, refused to drive!!
MAYER You're Champion of the World, kiddo!
TEDDY MAYER takes JAMES's number `11' from the side of his car, and tears it in two, leaving number `1'.
JAMES's face: as he realizes.
Then explodes with happiness.
HESKETH and BUBBLES cheer in celebration...
HESKETH He did it!
HESKETH He bloody well did it!
A television plays in the Emergency Ward of the hospital.
NURSIE catches sight of the victory, patients cheering and applauding...
NURSIE allows herself a smile.
BURTON is at the door in tuxedo, waiting to go.
SUZY, dressed glamorously, smiles.
SUZY Well done, James..
Then turns the TV off.
And follows BURTON out.
JAMES is embraced by CALDWELL and MAYER.
Across the race-track, the sound of helicopter blades turning.
JAMES looks over to see...
NIKI in the helicopter with MARLENE and a PILOT.
NIKI, now the ex-World Champion, looks over to see a triumphant JAMES surrounded by press, McLaren colleagues, etc
MARLENE Are you OK?
NIKI turns, takes MARLENE's hand as he answers.
NIKI Fine.
NIKI It's just one race.
The helicopter lifts into the air, and flies off...
JAMES watches as the helicopter carrying NIKI flies away, then turns to see...
...the world's press begins to descend on him, and the biggest party of JAMES HUNT's life is about to begin..
In the background, the two JAPANESE DRIVERS are giving interviews again.
They didn't just survive, MASAHIRO HASEMI got the fastest lap of the race, and NORITAKE TAKAHARA came 9th...
And at that moment, magically, the sun breaks through, and the snowy peak of Mount Fuji is finally revealed.
Of newspaper headlines, television talk shows, lucrative endorsements, TV commercials, sponsorship, public billboards.
JAMES's world championship victory has made him a rich man.
His movie star looks make him an international STAR and marketing man's dream.
Girls, more girls, and even more girls.
JAMES, dashing in a white suit, plays trumpet on the UK's most famous talk show...
We're on the runway of an airport in Northern Italy.
A stretch limousine pulls up on the tarmac.
A still-drunk JAMES HUNT and several good-looking WOMEN, rowdy FRIENDS (and hangers-on) spill out of the limo...
They cross the tarmac towards their waiting private jet, passing other jets, when JAMES stops.
He's seen something that has caught his eye.
JAMES sends his FRIENDS on ahead to their waiting jet, and walks over to a small private jet, (a Learjet 35)...
JAMES I heard you were spending more and more time in one of these...
A hunched PILOT doing final checks.
The figure turns.
It's NIKI.
His wounds have healed a little, but it's still a painful sight...
NIKI Do you fly?
JAMES No.
NIKI You should try it.
NIKI If something goes wrong up there, you're on the edge, but have to stay within the rules.
NIKI Stick to regulations.
NIKI Suppress the ego.
NIKI It's good discipline for the racing.
JAMES And there I was thinking you were about to wax lyrical about the romance of flight.
JAMES I should have known better.
NIKI What brings you here?
JAMES indicates his rowdy, cool-looking friends..
JAMES A friend's wedding.
JAMES At least I think it was a wedding.
JAMES Might have been a birthday.
JAMES All a bit of a blur.
JAMES How about you?
JAMES Been at Fiorano?
NIKI Pre-season testing.
JAMES Already?
JAMES In February?
JAMES You're relentless.
NIKI Thank you.
JAMES I'm not sure I meant it as a compliment.
NIKI But it is one.
NIKI Relentlessness is good.
NIKI Means you're a fighter.
NIKI That you never give up.
NIKI Behind my back I know some of you guys call me `The Rat.' Because I look like one.
NIKI It's meant as an insult.
NIKI But I don't mind it.
NIKI Rats are ugly, sure.
NIKI And no one likes them.
NIKI But they're intelligent.
NIKI With a strong survival instinct.
JAMES can't help smiling.
That's NIKI.
NIKI So when do you start testing?
NIKI Next week?
JAMES Are you mad?
JAMES I didn't just win the biggest thing of my life so I could get right back to work.
NIKI Why?
NIKI You need to.
NIKI To prove to all the people who will always say you only won it because...
JAMES Because what...?
JAMES Because of your accident?
JAMES Is that other people, Niki?
JAMES Or you?
JAMES I won.
JAMES On the all important day when it came down to it, we raced on equal terms in equally good cars.
JAMES (contid) You bottled and I had the guts to see it through.
NIKI It's true.
NIKI You won that race.
NIKI And believe me if I had to lose that title to anyone, I'm happy it was you.
NIKI But that doesn't change the fact you have to win again.
JAMES Why?
NIKI Because that's what it means to be a winner, no?
NIKI It's a permanent condition.
NIKI Never stops or goes away.
NIKI It stays with you always.
JAMES That's winning?
JAMES Sounds like losing to me.
JAMES Some of life needs to be for pleasure, Niki.
JAMES What's the use of having a million cups and medals if you never have any fun?
JAMES How is that winning?
The plane load of JAMES's friends call out..."
C'mon, James!"
NIKI You're right.
NIKI I could learn from you.
NIKI In hospital the toughest part of my treatment was the vacuum.
NIKI Pumping the shit out of my lungs.
NIKI It was agony.
NIKI While doing it, I was watching television...you winning all those races...and I was cursing you..
NIKI "That bastard, Hunt", I would shout, "I hate that guy."
NIKI one day the doctor said, "Mr.
NIKI Lauda, may I offer one piece of advice?
NIKI Stop thinking of it as a curse to have been given an enemy in life.
NIKI It can be a blessing, too."
NIKI I said, "Who are you, Confucius?" He said, "A wise man gets more from his enemies than a fool from his friends."
NIKI And you know, he's right.
NIKI Look at us.
NIKI We were a pair of kids when we first met.
NIKI Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3.
NIKI Headed nowhere.
NIKI Now we're both Champions of the world.
NIKI Not bad.
JAMES No, not bad.
NIKI So don't let me down now.
NIKI I need you busting my balls.
NIKI Get back to work.
JAMES I will, Niki.
JAMES But I intend to enjoy myself first.
JAMES And so should you.
JAMES You think you can?
NIKI stares.
A blank look..
JAMES See you on race day, Champ.
NIKI You will.
NIKI Champ.
JAMES goes.
NIKI watches him, pulled into his plane by his laughing, cool FRIENDS.
An unmistakable flicker of envy in his eyes.
Then NIKI turns, alone, and resumes his safety checks.
JAMES's plane roars down the runway and takes off into the azure blue sky...
