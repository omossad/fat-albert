<p ID="slug">INT.
BAR - NIGHT
<p ID="act">A smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit.
<p ID="act">CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older lady named LUCY.
She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed.
But, you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">In "Jailhouse Rock" he's everything rockabilly's about.
I mean he is rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude.
In that movie he couldn't give a fuck about anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and leaving a good-looking corpse.
I love that scene where after he's made it big he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and he's singing, "Baby You're So Square...
Baby, I Don't Care".
Now, they got him dressed like a dick.
He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this horrible sweater.
Elvis ain't no sweater boy.
I even think they got him wearin' penny loafers.
Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party, big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker.
I'd watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad.
Elvis looked good.
I'm no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'.
He was fuckin' prettier than most women.
I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy...
I mean had too 'cause my life depended on it...
I'd fuck Elvis.
<p ID="act">Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.
<P ID="speaker">LUCY <P ID="dia">I'd fuck Elvis.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Really?
<P ID="speaker">LUCY <P ID="dia">When he was alive.
I wouldn't fuck him now.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I don't blame you.
<P ID="spkdir">(they laugh) <P ID="dia">So we'd both fuck Elvis.
It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
<p ID="act">Lucy laughs.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
<P ID="speaker">LUCY <P ID="dia">How 'bout me what?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
<P ID="speaker">LUCY <P ID="dia">What are we gonna see?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">A Donny Chiba triple feature.
"The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
<P ID="speaker">LUCY <P ID="dia">Who's Sonny Chiba?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
<P ID="speaker">LUCY <P ID="spkdir">(not believing this) <P ID="dia">You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="spkdir">(holding up three fingers) <P ID="dia">Three kung fu movies.
<p ID="act">Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.
<P ID="speaker">LUCY <P ID="spkdir">(laughing) <P ID="dia">I don't think so, not my cup of tea.

DINGY HOTEL ROOM - DAY
<p ID="act">The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots and violence.
Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained black.
<p ID="act">On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of cocaine.
Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the suitcase.
On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV.
"Bewitched" is playing.
<p ID="act">At the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table.
DREXL SPIVEY and FLOYD DIXON sit around.
Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic bags and a weigher.
Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't know it listen to him.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">That's bullshit.
<p ID="act">BIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl and Floyd.
Walks through the door carrying hamburgers and french fries in two greasy brown-paper bags.
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">Naw man, that's some serious shit.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
<P ID="speaker">BIG D <P ID="dia">What the fuck are you talkin' about?
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
<P ID="speaker">BIG D <P ID="dia">Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">I heard that.
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
<P ID="speaker">BIG D <P ID="dia">Nigger, I eat everything.
I eat pussy.
I eat the butt.
I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Preach on, Big D.
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">Look here.
If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body.
I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
<P ID="speaker">BIG D <P ID="dia">Shit!
Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things.
So you won't eat pussy?
Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers' dicks.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Heard that.
<p ID="act">Drexl and Big D bump fists.
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">Yeah, that's right, laugh.
It's so funny, oh it's so funny.
<P ID="spkdir">(he takes a hit off of a joint) <P ID="dia">There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked.
Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys.
And white boys are freaks for that shit -
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">- Because it's good!
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat.
And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.
<P ID="speaker">BIG D <P ID="dia">Drexl.
On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, I'd like to express our gratitude -
<p ID="act">Drexl and Big D bust up.
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">Go on pussy-eaters...
laugh.
You look like you be eatin' pussy.
You got pussy-eatin' mugs.
Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
<P ID="speaker">BIG D <P ID="dia">So you do eat pussy!
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">Naw naw!
<P ID="speaker">BIG D <P ID="dia">You don't like it, but you eat that shit.
<P ID="spkdir">(to Drexl) <P ID="dia">He eats it.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Damn skippy.
He like it, too.
<P ID="speaker">BIG D <P ID="spkdir">(mock English accent) <P ID="dia">Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">Well fuck you guys then!
You guys are fucked up!
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Why you trippin'?
We jus' fuckin' with ya.
But I wanna ask you a question.
You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy.
You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"
<P ID="speaker">BIG D <P ID="dia">Nigger, get real.
You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit.
Now what would you do.
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">I'd say fuck it!
<p ID="act">Drexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd sitting all alone.
<p ID="act">Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching "Bewitched".
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="spkdir">(yelling after them) <P ID="dia">Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
<P ID="speaker">BIG D <P ID="spkdir">(not even looking) <P ID="dia">Take that shit somewhere else.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="spkdir">(marching back) <P ID="dia">You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
<P ID="speaker">FLOYD <P ID="dia">If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
<P ID="speaker">BIG D <P ID="spkdir">(glued on TV) <P ID="dia">I'm hip.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration.
Big D, toss me that shotgun.
<p ID="act">Without turning away from "Bewitched" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to Drexl.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="spkdir">(to Floyd) <P ID="dia">All right, check this out.
<P ID="spkdir">(referring to shotgun) <P ID="dia">Now, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy.
And you're you.
<p ID="act">Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.
<p ID="act">Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.
<p ID="act">Drexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.
<p ID="act">The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.
<p ID="act">Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.
<p ID="act">Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back.
He slams into the wall and drops.
<p ID="act">Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves.
As he gets to the front door he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out.

TRAILER HOME - MORNING
<p ID="act">All three enter the trailer home.
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">Excuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late.
Sorry if I'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected to see this morning.
<p ID="act">Clarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Yeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people.
I'm dyin' on thirst, you got anything to drink?
<p ID="act">He moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator.
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="spkdir">(rumaging around the fridge) <P ID="dia">Anything stronger?
<P ID="spkdir">(pause) <P ID="dia">Oh, probably not.
Beer?
You can drink beer, can't you?
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">I can, but I don't.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="spkdir">(closing the fridge) <P ID="dia">That's about all I ever eat.
<p ID="act">Cliff looks at the Girl.
She smiles sweetly at him.

I'm his father.
<P ID="speaker">YOUNG GIRL <P ID="spkdir">(sticking her hand out) <P ID="dia">That's OK, I'm his wife.
<P ID="spkdir">(shaking his hand vigorously) <P ID="dia">Alabama Worley, pleased to meetcha.
<p ID="act">She is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman.
However, that's where the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere.
<p ID="act">Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit magnets in his hand.
He throws his other arm around Alabama.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Oh yeah, we got married.
<P ID="spkdir">(referring to the magnets) <P ID="dia">You still have these.
<P ID="spkdir">(to Alabama) <P ID="dia">This isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one.
I never shit it out, so I guess it's still there.
Loverdoll, why don't you be a sport and go get us some beer.
I want some beer.
<P ID="spkdir">(to Cliff) <P ID="dia">Do you want some beer?
Well, if you want some it's here.
<p ID="act">He hands her some money and his car keys.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Go to the liquor store - <P ID="spkdir">(to Cliff) <P ID="dia">Where is there a liquor store around here?
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">Uh, yeah...
there's a party store down 54th.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="spkdir">(to Alabama) <P ID="dia">Get a six-pack of something imported.
It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things.
If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has.
Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well.
I'm fuckin' starvin' to death.
Are you hungry too?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I'm pretty hungry.
When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food.
What would taste good.
<P ID="spkdir">(to Cliff) <P ID="dia">What do you think would taste good?
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">I'm really not very -
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You know what would taste good?
Chicken.
I haven't had chicken in a while.
Chicken would really hit the spot about now.
Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.
<P ID="spkdir">(to Cliff) <P ID="dia">Where's a good chicken place around here?
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">I really don't know.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You don't know the chicken places around where you live?
<P ID="spkdir">(to Alabama) <P ID="dia">Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
<p ID="act">He gives her some more money.

Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts.

Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">She seems very nice.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Daddy.
Nice isn't the word.
Nice is an insult.
She's a peach.
That's the only word for it, she's a peach.
She even tastes like a peach.
You can tell I'm in love with her.
You can tell by my face, can't ya?
It's a dead giveaway.
It's written all over it.
Ya know what?
She loves me back.
Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -

<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing!
I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible.
After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything?
When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it?
No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand".
The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit?
No!
Everybody else did.
I never did.
You see, I know that you're just a bad parent.
You're not really very good at it.
But I know you love me.
I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy.
If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask.
And if you say no, don't worry about it.
I'm gone.
No problems.

As Cliff talks, all the noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line.
He's talking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force.

<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route.

In fact, they think it's drug related.

Why drug related?
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">No shit?

Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle.

Drug Dealer.
Somebody you don't want on your ass.
Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing.
That guy wasn't just some wild flake.

The guy was like a mad dog.
So the cops aren't looking for me?

So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.

Keep him out of trouble.

<P ID="speaker">GUN CARRIER (DARIO) <P ID="dia">Welcome home, alchy.
We're havin' a party.
<p ID="act">Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room.
Waiting for him are four men, standing: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy), and Tooth-pick Vic (a fireplug pitbull type).
<p ID="act">Sitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid mob leader Blue Lou Boyle.
<p ID="act">Cliff is knocked to his knees.
He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti.
Dario and Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.

Dario stands on one side of Cliff.
Frankie and Lenny ransack the trailer.
Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his hand, but he has yet to touch a drop.

<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">I give up.
Who are you?
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="dia">I'm the Anti-Christ.
You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you.
My name is Vincenzo Coccotti.
I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from.
I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before.
Am I correct?
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="dia">I'm glad.
Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself.
Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.

<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">No.

About you boy's age.
I can imagine how painful this must be for you.
But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves.
And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em.
You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
<p ID="act">Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with his fist.
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="dia">Smarts, don't it?
Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up.
You got that pain shootin' through your brain.
Your eyes fill up with water.
It ain't any kind of fun.
But what I have to offer you.
That's as good as it's ever gonna get, and it won't ever get that good again.
We talked to your neighbors.
They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in front of your trailer yesterday.
Mr. Worley, have you seen your son?
<p ID="act">Cliff's defeated.
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">I've seen him.
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="dia">Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you.
So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light.
That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity.
Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">What are you talkin' about?
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="dia">I'm talkin' about a massacre.
They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there.
Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand.
A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">I don't believe you.
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="dia">That's of minor importance.
But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you.
Where did they go?
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">On their honeymoon.
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="dia">I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time.
Where did they go?
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">They didn't tell me.
<p ID="act">Coccotti looks at him.
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">Now, wait a minute and listen.
I haven't seen Clarence in three years.
Yesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married.
He told me he needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could borrow five hundred dollars.
I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a check.
We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him.
So help me God.
They never thought to tell me where they were goin'.
And I never thought to ask.
<p ID="act">Coccotti looks at him for a long moment.
He then gives Virgil a look.
Virgil, quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up.
He then whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal on the wound.
Cliff screams.
<p ID="act">Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.
<p ID="act">Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in the car.
<p ID="act">Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel.
Cliff holds his bleeding palm in agony.
Virgil hands him the dishtowel.
Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="dia">Sicilians are great liars.
The best in the world.
I'm a Sicilian.
And my old man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars.
And from growin' up with him I learned the pantomime.
Now there are seventeen different things a guy can do when he lies to give him away.
A guy has seventeen pantomimes.
A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen.
And if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to hell.
What we got here is a little game of show and tell.
You don't wanna show me nothin'.
But you're tellin' me everything.
Now I know you know where they are.
So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away from.
<p ID="act">The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart.
He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes.
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="dia">Sure.
<p ID="act">Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">Got a match?
<p ID="act">Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">Oh, don't bother.
I got one.
<P ID="spkdir">(he lights the cigarette) <P ID="dia">So you're a Sicilian, huh?
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="spkdir">(intensly) <P ID="dia">Uh-huh.
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">You know I read a lot.
Especially things that have to do with history.
I find that shit fascinating.
In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
<p ID="act">All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted.
Coccotti can't believe what he's hearing.
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="dia">Come again?
<P ID="speaker">CLIFF <P ID="dia">It's a fact.
Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts.
If you don't believe me, look it up.
You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily.
And Moors are niggers.
Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy.
Blond hair, blue eyes.
But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country.
They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin.
I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene.
I'm just quotin' history.
It's a fact.
It's written.
Your ancestors were niggers.
Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid.
That is a fact.
Now tell me, am I lyin'?
<p ID="act">Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic, grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets through Cliff's head.
<p ID="act">He pushes the body violently aside.
Coccotti pauses.
Unable to express his feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon, and turns to his men.
<P ID="speaker">COCCOTTI <P ID="dia">I haven't killed anybody since 1974.
Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity in fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands!
Go to this comedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me where that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this fucked-up family for good.
<p ID="act">Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was all about.
<p ID="act">Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer.
When he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic banana magnet that says: "Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and address)".

Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here."
He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital.
So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude.
Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo.
So they asked Waldo where he was from.

THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT
<p ID="act">It's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny Chiba taking on all-comers.
<p ID="act">Alabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food.
She makes a quick scan of the theater.
Not many people are there.
She makes a beeline for the front whick happens to be Clarence's area of choice.
She picks the row of seats just behind Clarence and starts asking her way down it.
<p ID="act">Clarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone moving towards him.
He turns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious.
<p ID="act">When Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine bottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn over Clarence.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Oh, look what happened.
Oh god, I'm so sorry.
Are you OK?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Yeah.
I'm fine.
It didn't hurt.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="spkdir">(picking popcorn out of his hair) <P ID="dia">It's OK.
Don't worry about it.
Accidents happen.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="spkdir">(picking popcorn out of his hair) <P ID="dia">What a wonderful philosophy.
Thanks for being such a sweetheart.
You could have been a real dick.
<p ID="act">Alabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie.
<p ID="act">Clarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't easy, and get back into the movie.
<p ID="act">They both watch the screen for a moment.
Then, Alabama leans forward and taps Clarence on the shoulder.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Excuse me...
I hate to bother you again.
Would you mind too terribly filling me in on what I missed?
<p ID="act">Jumping on this opportunity.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Not at all.
I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">The oriental.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">The oriental in black.
He's an assasin.
Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had.
So he got himself arrested.
They take him into the police station.
And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses.
Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill.
Does a number on him.
Kicks the cops' asses some more.
Kicks the bars out of the window.
And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Want some Goobers?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Thanks a lot.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I thought Sonny was the good guy.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker.
Sonny don't be bullshittin'.
He fucks dudes up for life.
Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
<p ID="act">They both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses.
<p ID="right">TIME CUT:
<p ID="act">On the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up.
Dead bodies lie all around him.
THE END (in Japanese) flashes on the screen.
<p ID="act">The theater light go up.
Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence.
They're both applauding.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Great movie.
Action-packed!
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Sonny kicks ass.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter".
It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence.
But we just saw the R.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Alabama Whitman.
Pleased to meet ya.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Is that your real name?
Really?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">That's my real name, really.
I got proof.
See.
<p ID="act">She shows Clarence her driver's license.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Well, cut my legs off and call me Shorty.
That's a pretty original moniker there, Alabama.
Sounds like a Pam Grier movie.
<P ID="spkdir">(announcer voice) <P ID="dia">She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'!
She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist, and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes!
Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!
Pray for forgiveness, Rated R...
for Ruthless Revenge!

THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT
<p ID="act">Clarence and Alabama are outside the theater.
With the marquee lit up in the background they both perform unskilled martial arts moves.
Clarence and Alabama break up laughing.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Where's your car?
I'll walk you to it.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I took a cab.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Sure.
Why not?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Nothing.
It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">What time is it?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">'Bout twelve.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">No.
Not particularly.

<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it.
It's sort of tradition.
Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I love to get pie after a movie.

DENNY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
<p ID="act">Clarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's.
It's about 12:40 a.m.
Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke.
Alabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Well, enough about the King.
How about you?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">How 'bout me what?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Tell me about yourself.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">There's nothing to tell.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">C'mon.
What're ya tryin' to be?
The Phantom Lady?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">What do you want to know?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Well, for starters, what do you do?
Where're ya from?
What's your favorite color?
Who's your favorite movie star?
What kinda music do you like?
What are your turn-ons and turn-offs?
Do you have a fella?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
<p ID="act">Alabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Ask me them again.
One by one.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What do you do?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I don't remember.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Where are you from.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Might be from Tallahassee.
But I'm not sure yet.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What's your favorite color?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I don't remember.
But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What's your favorite movie star?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Burt Reynolds.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Would you like a bite of my pie?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Yes, I would.
<p ID="act">Clarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Like it?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Very much.
Now, where were we?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What kinda music do you like?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Phil Spector.
Girl group stuff.
You know, like "He's a Rebel".
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What are your turn-ons?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Turn-offs?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember.
The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Do you have a fella?
<p ID="act">She looks at Clarence and smiles.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I'm not sure yet.
Ask me again later.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia.
When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from.
Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name.
I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit.
So that was no help.
But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar.
For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar.
So I told him to stop and I got out.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared.
And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
<p ID="act">Clarence looks at her closely.
He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until it makes that slurping sound.
He puts it aside and stares into her soul.
<p ID="act">A smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.

COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT
<p ID="act">It's about 1:30 a.m.
Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works.
It's a comic book store called Heroes For Sale.
Alabama thinks this place is super-cool.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Wow.
What a swell place to work.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">How long have you worked here?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Almost four years.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">That's a long time.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I'm hip.
But you know, I'm comfortable here.
It's easy work.
I know what I'm doing.
Everybody who works here is my buddy.
I'm friendly with most of the customers.
I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Do you get paid a lot?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">That's where trouble comes into paradise.
But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it.
Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">You bet.
How much is that worth?
<p ID="act">Clarence gets a box off the shelf.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Four hundred bucks.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Well, we sell other things too.
Cool stuff.
"Man from U.N.C.L.E."
Lunch boxes.
"Green Hornet" board games.
Shit like that.
But comic books are main business.
There's a lot of collectors around here.
<p ID="act">She holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">What's that?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">That's a "Rookies" doll.
George Sanford Brown.
We gotta lotta dolls.
They're real cool.
Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"?
I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
<p ID="act">He pulls a plastic-cased "Spiderman" comic form the box.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">"Spiderman", number one.
The one that started it all.
<p ID="act">Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">God, Spiderman looks different.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">He was just born, remember?
This is the first one.
You know that guy, Dr.
Gene Scott?
He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised.
Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it.
Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
<p ID="act">He pulls out another comic.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">"Sgt.
Fury and His Howling Commandos".
One of the coolest series known to man.
They're completely worthless.
You can get number one for about four bucks.
But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap.
<P ID="spkdir">(he opens one up) <P ID="dia">Just look at that artwork, will ya.
Great stories.
Great Characters.
Look at this one.
<p ID="act">We see the "Sgt.
Fury" panels.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Nick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on a chain.
OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on a ship.
He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain and the ring goes overboard too.
So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it.
Isn't that cool?
<p ID="act">She's looking into Clarence's eyes.
He turns and meets her gaze.

<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">What a cool room!
<p ID="act">She runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed.
<p ID="act">Later.
Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album.
Clarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit.
How old were you then?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Five.

<p ID="act">Clarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's "Piece of My Heart".
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You know when you sat behind me?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">At the movies?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">What would make you think that?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I dunno.
I guess I'm just stupid.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">You're not stupid.
Just wrong.
<p ID="act">They move to the music.
Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the song.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I love Janis.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">She OD'd, didn't she?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Yeah, she OD'd.
But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'.
She didn't take too much.
It shouldn't have killed her.
There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">You mean she got a bad batch?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">That's what happened.
In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life.
She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them.
She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him.
Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money.
So, she said no.
And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it.
So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it."
So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes.
And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">So he really loved her?

I was paid to be there.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What are you, a theater checker?
You check up on the box office girls.
Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I'm not a theater checker.
I'm a call girl.
<p ID="act">Pause.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You're a whore?

That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">"Heroes For Sale"?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Yeah, that one.
Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Who?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I don't know.
I didn't talk with them.
The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep.
I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America.
That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">That dazzling imagination.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">It's over on the TV.
All it says is: "Dear Clarence."
I couldn't write anymore.
I didn't not want to ever see you again.
In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again.
Las night...
I don't know...
I felt...
I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts.
So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Who and what is a Drexl?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">My pimp.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You have a pimp?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Uh-huh.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">A real live pimp?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Uh-huh.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Is he black?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">He thinks he is.
He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Is he nice?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent.
But I've only been there about four days.
He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What did he do to Arlene?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Slapped her around a little.
Punched her in the stomch.
It was pretty scary.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">This motherfucker sounds charming!
<p ID="act">Clarence is on his feet, furious.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there!
How much longer before he's slappin' you around?
Punchin' you in the stomach?
How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">At the bus station.
He said I'd be a perfect call girl.
And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me.
They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar.
And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night.
At least five hundred.
They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill".
And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way.
He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects.
But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch.
So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes.
It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night.
You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick.
Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date.
An, um, I guess I want a second date.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Thank you.
I wanna see you again too.
And again, and again, and again.
Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce.
So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">What?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Will you be my wife?
<p ID="act">When Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.

<p ID="act">Moving on top of her.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Not for me.

Alabama's startled by his sudden movement.

<p ID="act">Clarence splashes water on his face, trying to wash away the images that keep polluting his mind.
Then, he hears a familiar voice.
<P ID="speaker">FAMILIAR VOICE <P ID="spkdir">(off) <P ID="dia">Well?
Can you live with it?
<p ID="act">Clarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to Elvis Presley.
Clarence isn't surprised to see him.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What?
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">Can you live with it?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Live with what?
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you?
And gettin' away with it every day.
Are you haunted?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Yeah.
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">You wanna get unhaunted?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Yeah.
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">Then shoot 'em.
Shoot 'em in the face.

<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">I ain't tellin' ya nothin'.
I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You'd really do that?
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">He don't got no right to live.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me.
He doesn't deserve to live.
And I do want to kill him.
But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">I don't blame you.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">If I thought I could get away with it -
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">Killin' 'em's the hard part.
Gettin' away with it's the easy part.
Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed?
Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it?
They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head.
If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.

<p ID="act">He kneels down before her and holds her hand.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Look, sweetheart, he scares you.
But I'm not scared of that motherfucker.
He can't touch you now.
You're completely out of his reach.
He poses absolutely no threat to us.

<p ID="act">It's pretty late at night.
Clarence steps out of his red Mustang.
He's right smack dab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime.
He checks the pulse on his neck; it's beating like a race horse.
To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis Presley gyration.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="spkdir">(in Elvis voice) <P ID="dia">Yeah...

<p ID="act">He makes a beeline for the front door of a large, dark apartment building.

DARK BUILDING - NIGHT
<p ID="act">He's inside.
His heart's really racing now.
He has the TV guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand.
He climbs a flight of stairs and makes his way down a dark hallway to apartment 22, the residence of Drexl Spivey.
Clarence knock on the door.
<p ID="act">A Young Black Man, about twenty years old, answers the door.
He has really big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey.
<P ID="speaker">YOUNG BLACK MAN <P ID="dia">You want somethin'?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Drexl?
<P ID="speaker">YOUNG BLACK MAN <P ID="dia">Naw, man, I'm Marty.

<P ID="speaker">MARTY <P ID="dia">Well, what the fuck you wanna tell him?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">It's about Alabama.
<p ID="act">A figure jumps in the doorway wearing a yellow Farah Fawcett T-shirt.
It's our friend, Drexl Spivey.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Where the fuck is that bitch?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">She's with me.

DREXL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
<p ID="act">Drexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation they were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway.
This is not the confrontation Clarence expected.
He trails in behind Drexl and Marty.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="spkdir">(to Marty) <P ID="dia">What was I sayin'?
<P ID="speaker">MARTY <P ID="dia">Rock whores.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores.
They ass be young man.
They got that fine young pussy.
Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you.
They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
<p ID="act">Drexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="spkdir">(to Clarence) <P ID="dia">You know what I'm talkin' about.
<p ID="act">Drexl gestures to one of the three stoned Hookers lounging about the apartment.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="spkdir">(to Marty) <P ID="dia">These bitches over here ain't shit.
You stomp them bitches to death to get the kind of pussy I'm talkin' about.
<p ID="act">Drexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-out boxes of Chinese food.
A black exploitation movie is playing on TV.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
<P ID="speaker">MARTY <P ID="dia">Pussy love pink rocks.
<p ID="act">This is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he expected Drexl to be like.
He positions himself in front of the food table, demanding Drexl's attention.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="spkdir">(eating with chopsticks, to Clarence) <P ID="dia">Grab a seat there, boy.
Want some dinner?
Grab yourself an egg roll.
We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">No thanks.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">No thanks?
What does that mean?
Means you ate before you came down here?
All full.
Is that it?
Naw, I don't think so.
I think you're too scared to be eatin'.
Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit.
I'm still a mystery to you.
But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from.
See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world.
Who know?
Maybe he don't.
Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV."
See?
You ain't even sat down yet.
On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look.
You just been starin' at me.
Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
<p ID="act">Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not hungry.
I'm not sittin' 'cause I'm not stayin'.
I'm not lookin' at the movie 'cause I saw it seven years ago.
It's "The Mack" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by Bobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama Releasing Company in 1984.
I'm not scared of you.
I just don't like you.
In that envelope is some payoff money.
Alabama's moving on to some greener pastures.
We're not negotiatin'.
I don't like to barter.
I don't like to dicker.
I never have fun in Tijuana.
That price is non-negotiable.
What's in that envelope is for my peace of mind.
My peace of mind is worth that much.
Not one penny more, not one penny more.
<p ID="act">You could hear a pin drop.
Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full alert.
Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing.
All eyes are on Drexl.
Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope.
It's empty.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">It's empty.
<p ID="act">Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, "That's right, asshole."
<p ID="act">Silence.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Oooooooooh weeeeeeee!
This child is terrible.
Marty, you know what we got here?
Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson.
Is that who you supposed to be?
Mr.
Majestyk?
Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary.
I ain't got no hold on Alabama.
I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand -
<p ID="act">Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at Clarence, catching him of guard.
<p ID="act">Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting him in a tight choke hold.
<p ID="act">Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus.
We'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.
<p ID="act">All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold records, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.
<p ID="act">Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.
<p ID="act">Since Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.
<p ID="act">Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about it.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Ya wanna fuck with me?
<P ID="spkdir">(hits Clarence) <P ID="dia">Ya wanna fuck with me?
<P ID="spkdir">(hits Clarence) <P ID="dia">I'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit!
<p ID="act">He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.
<p ID="act">Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs his nails in.
He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and starts twisting.
<p ID="act">Marty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip aroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of his head.
<p ID="act">Drexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's thumb.
<p ID="act">Clarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and busting his nose.
<p ID="act">Marty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck.
Clarence wiggles free and gets up on his knees.
<p ID="act">Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing.
The two are going at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping them coming fast and furious.
They're not doing much damage to each other because of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.
<p ID="act">Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of LPs.
This disorients Clarence.
Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to his feet.
<p ID="act">Drexl socks him in the face: one, two three!
Then he kicks him hard in the balls.
<p ID="act">Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes.
He curls up into a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.
<p ID="act">Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.
<p ID="act">Marty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="spkdir">(to Marty) <P ID="dia">You OK?
That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
<P ID="speaker">MARTY <P ID="dia">Naw.
It don't feel too good but it's alright.
<p ID="act">Drexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="spkdir">(to Clarence) <P ID="dia">You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy?
You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house!
Gonna come in here and tell me!
Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees.
Shit!
Your ass must be crazy.
<P ID="spkdir">(to Marty) <P ID="dia">I don't think that white boy's got good sense.
Hey, Marty.
<P ID="spkdir">(laughing) <P ID="dia">He must of thought it was white boy day.
It ain't white boy day, is it?
<P ID="speaker">MARTY <P ID="spkdir">(laughing) <P ID="dia">Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="spkdir">(to Clarence) <P ID="dia">Shit, man, you done fucked up again.
Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="spkdir">(hurting) <P ID="dia">Wannabee nigger...
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Fuck you!
My mother was Apache.
<p ID="act">Drexl kicks him again.
Clarence curls up.
<p ID="act">Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket.
<p ID="act">Clarence still can't do much.
The kick to his balls still has him down.
<p ID="act">Drexl finds it and pulls it out.
He flips it open to driver's license.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Well, well, well, looky what we got here.
Clarence Worley.
Sounds almost like a nigger name.
<P ID="spkdir">(to Clarence) <P ID="dia">Hey, dummy.
<p ID="act">He puts his foot on Clarence's chest.
Clarence's POV as he looks up.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Before you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit.
I just chalked it up to au revoir Alabama.
But, because you think you're some macho motherfucker, I know who she's with.
You.
I know who you are, Clarence Worley.
And, I know where you live, 4900 116th street, apartment 48.
And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same address.
Marty, take the car and go get 'er.
Bring her dumb ass back here.
<p ID="act">He hands Marty the driver's license.
Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="spkdir">(to Marty) <P ID="dia">I'll keep lover boy here entertained.
<P ID="spkdir">(to Clarence) <P ID="dia">You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here.

I mean it ain't nuttin' new.
She's done it before.
But I want you as a audience.

<P ID="speaker">MARTY <P ID="spkdir">(off) <P ID="dia">I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
<P ID="speaker">DREXL <P ID="dia">Look in the hamper.
Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
<p ID="act">While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock and pulls out the .38.
he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs.
Drexl, who's standing over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger and blow his balls to bits.
Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.
<p ID="act">Drexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground.
<P ID="speaker">MARTY <P ID="spkdir">(off) <P ID="dia">What's happening?
<p ID="act">Marty steps into the room.
<p ID="act">Clarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest.
<p ID="act">Two of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming.
The other Hooker is curled up in the corner.
She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to be terrified.
<p ID="act">Drexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his balls and his dick.
<p ID="act">Clarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Get a bag and put Alabama's thing in it!
<p ID="act">She doesn't move.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You wanna get shot?
I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it!
<p ID="act">The Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the bed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence.
<p ID="act">Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like a pillbug.
<p ID="act">CLOSEUP - Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand.

<p ID="act">She stops short.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I've got some food in the car, I'll be right back.

Except for the TV playing, the room is quiet.
Alabama sits on the couch.

He heaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Help yourself.

<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="spkdir">(in a daze) <P ID="dia">Was it him or you?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Yeah.
But to be honest, I put myself in that position.

I could.
So I did.

He continues eating and ignoring her.
Finally he spins on her, yelling:

He's not worth one of your tears.

Do you love him?

<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">This is Drexl's coke?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Drexl's dead.
This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it.
And what Clarence wants to do is sell it.
Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'.
So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
<p ID="act">Dick gulps half of his wine.
Clarence fills up.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">But you're an actor.
I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Yeah, they do.
And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys.
But most of the people I know are like me.
They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.
Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">No way!
The whole enchilada in one shot.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand.
How difficult can that be?
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group.
Big shots.
Fat cats.
Guys who can use that kind of quantity.
Guys who can afford two hundred thousand.
Basically, guys I don't know.
You don't know.
And, more important, they don't know you.
I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Is he big league?
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">He's nothing.
He's in my acting class.
But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this.
He could use it.
He could afford it.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What'd'ya tell 'em?
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Hardly anything.
I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What's this acting class guy's name?
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Elliot.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Elliot what?
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Elliot Blitzer.

<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What's to think about?
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Shut up!
First you come waltzing into my life after two years.
You're married.
You killed a guy.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Two guys.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Two guys.
Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal.
Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl.
I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved.
I got no pity for a mad dog like that.
I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
<p ID="act">Dick rests his head in his hands.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Look, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need you to rise to the occasion.
So, drink some more wine.
Get used to the idea, and get your friend to the phone.

One look at Elliot and you can see what type of actor he is, a real GQ, blow-dry boy.
As they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal crackers and Alabama is blowing soap bubbles.
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="dia">So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -

<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I grow it on my window-sill.
The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="spkdir">(forcing a laugh) <P ID="dia">Ha ha ha.
No really, where does it come from?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Coco leaves.
You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="spkdir">(turning to Dick) <P ID="dia">Look, Dick, I don't -
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="spkdir">(laughing) <P ID="dia">No problem, Elliot.
I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all.
Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet.
Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business.
But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="dia">What department?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">What do you think, eightball?
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="dia">The police department?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Duh.
What else would I be talking about?
Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions.
Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour.
He snagged this coke.
But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="dia">He trusts you?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">We were in Four H together.
We've known each other since childhood.
So, I'm handling the sales part.
He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him.
I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="dia">Sure.
I didn't hear anything.

He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years.
They're reliable.
They're dependable.
And, they're safe.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Riddle me this, Batman.
If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here?
I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass.
Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off.
He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it.
At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend.
And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here.
I'm not puttin' him down.
Hey, let him run wild.
Have a ball, it's his money.

One less thing I gotta worry about.
<p ID="act">Virgil closes the case.
Alabama sifts through her purse.
<p ID="act">She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up.
Virgil turns toward her.
<P ID="speaker">VIRGIL <P ID="dia">OK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth -
<p ID="act">Alabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands.
Mr. Karate-man smiles.
<P ID="speaker">VIRGIL <P ID="dia">Kid, you got a lotta heart.
<p ID="act">He moves toward her.
<p ID="act">Alabama's hands are shaking.
<P ID="speaker">VIRGIL <P ID="dia">Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you a free swing.
Now, I only do that for people I like.
<p ID="act">He moves close.
<p ID="act">Alabama's eyes study him.
He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open.
Buttons fly everywhere.
<P ID="speaker">VIRGIL <P ID="dia">Go ahead, girl, take a stab at it.
<P ID="spkdir">(giggling) <P ID="dia">You don't have anything to lose.
<p ID="act">CLOSEUP - Alabama's face.
Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose.
Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth.
The ferocity in women that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many women all of the time, is unleashed.
The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into "I'll take this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do" seething hatred.
<p ID="act">Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.
<p ID="act">CLOSEUP - VIRGIL'S FACE
<p ID="act">Talk about bloodcurling yells.
<p ID="act">Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running down his face.
<p ID="act">While Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter that Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head.
It's only made of plaster, so it doesn't kill him.
<p ID="act">Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.
<P ID="speaker">VIRGIL <P ID="dia">OK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.
<p ID="act">Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him.
He instinctively catches it and, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the nose, breaking it.
<p ID="act">Her eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it.
She runs to it, bends over the chair for the gun.
Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back, sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.
<p ID="act">Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama.
Alabama's lying on the ground laughing.
Virgil has killed a lot of people, but not one of them has ever laughed before he did it.
<P ID="speaker">VIRGIL <P ID="dia">What's so fuckin' funny?!!
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="spkdir">(laughing) <P ID="dia">You look so ridiculous.
<p ID="act">She laughs louder.
Virgil's insane.
He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.
<P ID="speaker">VIRGIL <P ID="dia">Laugh it up, cunt.
You were in hysterics a minute ago.
Why ain't you laughing now?
<p ID="act">Alabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in her hand.
<p ID="act">Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.
<p ID="act">Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face.
He lets go of her and his hands go to his eyes.
<P ID="speaker">VIRGIL <P ID="dia">Oh Jesus!
<p ID="act">She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.
<P ID="speaker">VIRGIL <P ID="dia">Oh Mary, help me!
<p ID="act">The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower.
She's clutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass.
She's vaguely reminiscent of a Tasmanian devil.
Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming toward him.
He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks her into the toilet.
<p ID="act">He recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the toilet tank.
<p ID="act">Virgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama brings the lid down on his head.
He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet lid hitting him.
He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires anyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.
<p ID="act">The toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head.
He falls to the ground.
<p ID="act">Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net hairspray.
She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his gun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame, which results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.
<p ID="act">He fires off two shots.
One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending water spraying.
<p ID="act">Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama down, and runs out of the bathroom.
<p ID="act">Virgil collapses on the floor of the living room.
Then, he sees the sawed-off laying on the ground.
He crawls toward it.
<p ID="act">Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading.
She picks up the .45 automatic and fires at him.
It's empty.
She's on her feet and into the room.
<p ID="act">He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.
<p ID="act">Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife.
She takes a knife-first-running-dive at Virgil's back.
She hits him.
<p ID="act">He arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.
<p ID="act">Alabama snatches the shotgun.
<p ID="act">Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.
<p ID="act">The first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off.
The second hits him in the knee.
The third plays hell with his chest.
<p ID="act">Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.
<p ID="act">Ever since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been functioning independently.
She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy.
O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive, it is pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.
<p ID="act">Clarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn, only to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Honey?
<p ID="act">She continues.
He puts his gun away.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Sweetheart?
Cops are gonna be here any minute,
<p ID="act">She continues.
He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground.
She lies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms.
<p ID="act">Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his shoulder.

She never told him where I was.
It's like I always felt that the way she felt about me was a mistake.
She couldn't really care that much.
I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was jokin'.
But, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured with words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to - that's a test of oneself.

The dark-haired one is Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky Dimes.
<P ID="speaker">NICHOLSON <P ID="dia">Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -

And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">But there is a bright side though.
If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
<P ID="speaker">NICHOLSON <P ID="dia">And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass.

<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="dia">And if there's any sign of trouble you'll come in.
<P ID="speaker">NICHOLSON <P ID="dia">Like gang-busters.
Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
<P ID="speaker">NICHOLSON <P ID="dia">So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
<P ID="speaker">WURLITZER <P ID="dia">And this fellow Clarence?
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="dia">Yeah, Clarence.
<P ID="speaker">WURLITZER <P ID="dia">You gotta get him name the police officer behind all this.
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="dia">I'll try.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">You do more than try.
<P ID="speaker">NICHOLSON <P ID="dia">You do.

And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking.
Wam!
Right in my face.

Dick takes the suitcase.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I'll take that.
Now, remember, both of you, let me do the talking.
<p ID="act">Clarence takes out his .38.
Dick reacts.
They walk and talk.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">What the fuck did you bring that for.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">In case.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">In case of what?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">In case they try to kill us.
I don't know, what do you want me to say?
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I know that Richard.
I don't think I'll need it.
But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
<p ID="act">Pause.
Clarence stops walking.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Hold it, guys.
I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty scared.
What say we forget the whole thing.
<p ID="act">Dick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Do you really mean it?
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">No, I don't really mean it.
Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it.
How 'bout you, Bama?
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">It is what I want.
But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail.
I don't want you guys to go to jail.
We don't know what could be waiting for us up there.
It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be.
The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars.
I'm just looking at the downside.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">This is our last chance to play "what if".
I want to do it.
I'm just scared of getting caught.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">That rhymes.
<p ID="act">He kisses her.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Yeah, let's just get outta here.
<p ID="act">The three walk back to the car.
Clarence gets behind the wheel.
The other two climb in.
Clarence hops back out.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I'm sorry guys, I gotta do it.
As petrified as I am, I just can't walk away.
I'm gonna be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life if I don't go in there.
Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us, and he's not a cop, he's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high.
And I'm just the man who can get him there.
So what say we throw caution to the wind and let the chips fall where they may.
<p ID="act">Clarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the hotel.
Dick and Alabama exchange looks and follow.

But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy.
So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
<P ID="speaker">LEE <P ID="dia">I don't think that'll be necessary.
Let's all have a seat.
Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.

Please don't insult me.
Call me Lee.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">OK, sorry, Lee.
I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies.
After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
<P ID="speaker">LEE <P ID="dia">Thank you very much, Clarence.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand.
"Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs.

We park our cars in the same garage.

<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">They ain't plays, they ain't books, they certainly ain't movies, they're films.
And do you know what films are?
They're for people who don't like movies.
"Mad Max", that's a movie.
"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", that's a movie.
"Rio Bravo", that's a movie.
"Rumble Fish", that's a fuckin' movie.

You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
You're used to dealin' with professionals.
I'm not a professional.
I'm a rank amateur.
I could take that, and I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and make a helluva lot more money.
But, in order to do that, I'd have to become a drug dealer.
Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting busted all of the time.
Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta me, and you're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking movie-maker.
I like you, and I'm still scared.
I'm a punk kid who picked up a rock in the street, only to find out it's the Hope Diamond.
It's worth a million dollars, but I can't get the million dollars for it.
But, you can.
So, I'll sell it to you for a couple a hundred thousand.
You go to make a million.
It's all found money to me anyway.
Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred thousand is the world.

<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">OK, boys.
Let's go get 'em.
<p ID="slug">INT.
BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY
<p ID="act">Clarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door.
As soon as it's shut he starts doing the twist.
He can't believe he's pulled it off.
He goes to the toilet and starts taking a piss.
He turns and sees Elvis sitting on the sink.
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya.
You were cooler than cool.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I was dying.
I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes?
Being cool is hard on your body.
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">That was cool, wasn't it?
You know, I don't even know where that came from.
I just opened my mouth and it came out.
After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
<p ID="right">BACK TO:
<p ID="act">LEE'S ROOM
<p ID="act">Everything's just as it was.
<p ID="act">Sudenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives break into the room with guns drawn.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES & NICHOLSON <P ID="dia">Police!
Freeze, you're all under arrest!
<p ID="act">Everybody at the table stands up.
Boris and Monty stand ready with the Uzis.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">You two!
Put the guns on the floor and back away.
<P ID="speaker">MONTY <P ID="dia">Fuck you!
All you pigs put your guns on the floor and back away.
<P ID="speaker">LEE <P ID="dia">Monty, what are you talking about?
So what they say.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">This is your last warning!
Drop those fuckin' guns!
<P ID="speaker">BORIS <P ID="dia">This is your last warning!
We could kill all six of ya and ya fuckin' know it!
Now get on the floor!
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">What the fuck am I doing here?
<P ID="speaker">LEE <P ID="dia">Boris!
Everybody's gonna get killed!
They're cops!
<P ID="speaker">MONTY <P ID="dia">So they're cops.
Who gives a shit?
<P ID="speaker">BORIS <P ID="dia">Lee, something I never told you about me.
I don't like cops.
<P ID="speaker">NICHOLSON <P ID="dia">OK, let's everybody calm down and get nice.
Nobody has to die.
We don't want it, and you don't want it.
<P ID="speaker">LEE <P ID="dia">We don't want it.
<p ID="act">The four Wise-guys burst through the door, shotguns drawn, except for Frankie, who has two .45 automatics, one in each hand.
<p ID="act">Half of the cops spin around.
<P ID="speaker">WURLITZER <P ID="dia">Freeze!
<P ID="speaker">LENNY <P ID="dia">Who are you guys?
<P ID="speaker">WURLITZER <P ID="dia">Police.
<P ID="speaker">DARIO <P ID="spkdir">(to Lenny) <P ID="dia">Do we get any extra if we have to kill cops?
<p ID="right">BACK TO:
<p ID="act">BATHROOM
<p ID="act">Clarence and Elvis.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">Are you kiddin'?
He loves you.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I'm not lyin' to him.
I mean it.
I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
<p ID="act">Elvis fixes Clarence's collar.
<P ID="speaker">ELVIS <P ID="dia">I like ya, Clarence.
Always have.
<p ID="right">BACK TO:
<p ID="act">LEE'S ROOM
<p ID="act">This is a Mexican stand-off if there ever was one.
Gangsters on one end with shotguns.
Bodyguards with machine guns on the other.
And cops with handguns in the middle.
<p ID="act">Dick's ready to pass out.
<p ID="act">Alabama's so scared she pees on herself.
<p ID="act">For Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life, and he's just about had it.
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="dia">Officer Dimes?
Officer Dimes.
<p ID="act">Dimes looks at Elliot.
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="dia"> This has nothing to do with me anymore.
Can I just leave and you guys just settle it by yourselves?
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">Elliot, shut the fuck up and stay put!
<P ID="speaker">LEE <P ID="spkdir">(to Elliot) <P ID="dia">How did you know his name?
How the fuck did he know your name?
Why, you fuckin' little piece of shit!
<P ID="speaker">ELLIOT <P ID="dia">Lee, understand, I didn't want to -
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">Shut the fuck up!
<P ID="speaker">LEE <P ID="dia">Well, I hope you're not planning on acting any time in the next twenty years 'cause your career is over as of now!
You might as weel burn your SAG card!
To think I treated you as a son!
And you stabbed me in the heart!
<p ID="act">Lee can't control his anger any more.
He grabs the coffee pot off the table and flings hot coffee into Elliot's face.
Elliot screams and falls to his knees,
<p ID="act">Instinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice.
<p ID="act">Alabama screams.
<p ID="act">Boris lets loose with his Uzi, pinting Nicholson red with bullets.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="spkdir">(screaming) <P ID="dia">Cody!!!
<p ID="act">Nicholson flies backwards.
<p ID="act">Marvin fires his shotgun, hits Nicholson in the back, Nicholson's body jerks back and forth then on the floor.
<p ID="act">Clarence opens the bathroom door.
<p ID="act">Dimes hits the ground firing.
<p ID="act">A shot catches Clarence in the forehead.
<p ID="act">Alabama screams.
<p ID="act">Dario fires his sawed-off.
It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the bathroom sink, smashing the mirror.
<p ID="act">It might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either hits the ground or runs for cover.
<p ID="act">Dimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground.
<p ID="act">Boris dives into the kitchen area.
<p ID="act">Monty tips the table over.
<p ID="act">Marvin dives behind the sofa.
<p ID="act">Dario runs out of the door and down the hall.
<p ID="act">With bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything.
Two IA Officers are shot right away.
<p ID="act">Frankie takes an Uzi hit.
He goes down firing both automatics.
<p ID="act">Elliot gets it from both sides.
<p ID="act">Alabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the bathroom.
<p ID="act">Clarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching.
He moves and falls off.
<p ID="act">Alabama continues crawling.
<p ID="act">Marvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires.
The shotgun blast hits the glass table and Monty.
Monty stands up screaming.
<p ID="act">The Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty.
<p ID="act">As Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over the apartment.
<p ID="slug">EXT.
BEVERLY WILSHIRE - DAY
<p ID="act">Cop cars start arriving in twos in front of the hotel.
<p ID="right">BACK TO:
<p ID="act">GUNFIGHT
<p ID="act">Alabama crawling.
<p ID="act">The suitcase full of cocaine is by Dick.
Dick grabs it and tosses it in the air.
Marvin comes from behind the sofa and fires.
The suitcase is hit in mid-air.
White powder goes everywhere.
The room is enveloped in cocaine.
<p ID="act">Dick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door.
<p ID="act">An IA Officer goes after him.
<p ID="act">Lenny makes a break for it.
<p ID="act">Wurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin.
<p ID="act">Alabama reaches the bathroom and finds Clarence.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Sweety?
<p ID="act">Clarence's face is awash with blood.
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="dia">I...
I can't see you...
I've got blood in my eyes...
<p ID="act">He dies.
<p ID="act">Alabama tries to give him outh-to-mouth resuscitation.
<p ID="slug">INT.
BEVERLY WILSHIRE - HALLWAY - DAY
<p ID="act">Dario runs down the hall, right into a cluster of uniformed police.
<p ID="act">He fires his shotgun, hitting two, just before the others chop him to ribbons.
<p ID="slug">INT.
BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ANOTHER HALLWAY
<p ID="act">The hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast.
Dick comes around the corner, running as if on fire.
Then we see the IA Officer turn the same corner.
<P ID="speaker">IA OFFICER <P ID="spkdir">(aiming gun) <P ID="dia">Freeze!
<p ID="act">Dick does.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">I'm unarmed!
<P ID="speaker">IA OFFICER <P ID="dia">Put your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch!
<p ID="act">He does.
Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the IA Officer, sending him to the wall.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Oh shit.
<p ID="act">He starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the corner and runs down the hall.
<p ID="act">Dick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box.
<p ID="act">Lenny catches up.
Dick raises his hands.
Lenny aimes his sawed-off.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Look, I don't know who you are, but whatever it was that I did to you, I'm sorry.
<p ID="act">Two elevator doors on either side of them open.
<p ID="act">Lenny looks at Dick.
He drops his aim and says:
<P ID="speaker">LENNY <P ID="dia">Lotsa luck.
<p ID="act">Lenny dives into one elevator car.
Dick jumps into the other, just as the doors close.
<p ID="right">BACK TO:
<p ID="act">HOTEL ROOM
<p ID="act">The Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each other down.
<p ID="act">Wurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned down in the kitchen.
<p ID="act">In the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get his heart started.
It's not working.
She slaps him hard in the face a couple of times.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Wake up, goddamn it!
<p ID="act">Dimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the grip of a dead Wise-guy.
<p ID="act">Boris peeks around the wall to fire.
<p ID="act">Dimes lets loose with a blast.
A scream is heard.
<P ID="speaker">BORIS <P ID="spkdir">(off) <P ID="dia">I'm shot!
Stop!
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">Throw out your gun, asshole!
<p ID="act">The Uzi's tossed out.
<p ID="act">Dimes goes to where Wurlitzer is.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="spkdir">(to Marvin) <P ID="dia">OK, black jacket!
It's two against one now!
Toss the gun and lie face down on the floor or die like all you friends.
<p ID="act">The shotgun's tossed out from behind the sofa.
<p ID="slug">INT.
BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY
<p ID="act">Dick's sitting on the ground, he can't believe any of this.
The doors open on the fourth floor.
He runs out into the hallway.
<p ID="act">HALLWAY
<p ID="act">He starts trying the room doors for an open one.
<P ID="speaker">DICK <P ID="dia">Oh, God, if you just get me outta this I swear to God I'll never fuck up again.
Please, just let me get to "T.J.
Hooker" on Monday.
<p ID="act">STEWARDESS'S ROOM - DAY
<p ID="act">Dick steps in.
Three gorgeous girls are doing a killer aerobics workout to a video on TV.
The music is so loud they're so into their exercises, they don't hear Dick tiptoe behind them and crawl underneath the bed.
<p ID="act">LEE'S ROOM
<p ID="act">Boris has caught a lot of buckshots, but he'll live.
He's lying on the kitchen floor.
Dimes stands over him.
He has the sawed-off in his hand.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">Don't even give me an excuse, motherfucker.
<p ID="act">Dimes pats him down for other weapons, there are none.
<p ID="act">Wurlitzer puts the cuffs on Marvin and sits him down on the couch.
<p ID="act">Dimes looks in the bathroom and sees the dead Clarence with Alabama crying over him.
<p ID="act">Dimes walks over to Wurlitzer.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">Everything's under control here.
<P ID="speaker">WURLITZER <P ID="dia">Sorry about Nicholson.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">Me too.
<P ID="speaker">WURLITZER <P ID="dia">I'm gonna go see what's goin' on outside.
<P ID="speaker">DIMES <P ID="dia">You do that.
<p ID="act">Wurlitzer exits.
Dimes grabs the phone.
<p ID="act">LOBBY
<p ID="act">Shotgun in hand, Lenny moves hurriedly down the lobby.
<p ID="act">A Cop yells out.
<p ID="act">COP You!
Stop!
<p ID="act">Lenny brings up his sawed-off and lets him have it.
Other cops rush forward.
Lenny grabs a woman standing by.
<P ID="speaker">LENNY <P ID="dia">Get back or I'll blow this bitch's brains to kingdom come!
<p ID="act">LEE'S ROOM
<p ID="act">Dimes on the phone talking with the department.
Boris is still moving on the floor.
Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back.
Alabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket.
She reaches in and pulls out his .38.
She wipes her eyes.
She holds the gun in her hand and remembers Clarence saying:
<P ID="speaker">CLARENCE <P ID="spkdir">(off) <P ID="dia">She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'!
She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist, and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes!
Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!
Pray for forgiveness, Rated R...
for Ruthless Revenge!
<p ID="act">Alabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand.
<p ID="act">Marvin turns his head toward her.
She shoots him twice.
<p ID="act">Dimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun.
She fires.
He's hit in the head and flung to the floor.
<p ID="act">She sees Boris on the kitchen floor.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">Bye-bye, Boris.
Good luck.
<P ID="speaker">BORIS <P ID="dia">You too, cutie.
<p ID="act">She starts to leave and then spots the briefcase full of money.
She takes it and walks out the door.
<p ID="act">HALLWAY
<p ID="act">The elevator opens and Wurlitzer steps out.
<p ID="act">Alabama comes around the corner.
<P ID="speaker">WURLITZER <P ID="dia">Hey, you!
<p ID="act">Alabama shoots him three times in the belly.
She steps into the elevator, the doors close.
<p ID="act">LOBBY
<p ID="act">Alabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out.
In the background, cops are all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage.
<P ID="speaker">LENNY <P ID="dia">I wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready to take me to Kilimanjaro and...
and a million bucks!
<P ID="spkdir">(pause) <P ID="dia">Small bills!
<p ID="slug">EXT.
BEVERLY WILSHIRE - PARKING LOT - DAY
<p ID="act">Alabama puts the briefcase in the trunk.
She gets into the Mustang and drives away.
<p ID="slug">INT.
MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY
<p ID="act">Alabama's driving fast down the freeway.
The DJ on the radio is trying to be funny.
She's muttering to herself.
<P ID="speaker">ALABAMA <P ID="dia">I could have walked away.
I told you that.
I told you I could have walked away.
This is not my fault.
I did not do this.
You did this one hundred percent to yourself.
I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling bad.
I should laugh 'cause you don't deserve any better.
I could get another guy like that.
I'm hot lookin'.
What are you?
Dead!
Dumb jerk.
Asshole.
You're a asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole.
You wanted it all, didn't ya?
Didn't ya?
Well watcha got now?
You ain't got the money.
You ain't got me.
You ain't even got your body anymore.
You got nothin'.
Nada.
Zip.
Goose egg.
Nil.
Donut.
<p ID="act">The song "Little Arrows" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio.
Alabama breaks down and starts crying.
She pulls the car over to the side.
The song continues.
She wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket.
She tosses it on the dashboard.
She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth.
<p ID="act">She pulls back hammer.
She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view mirror.
She turns it the other way.
She looks straight ahead.
Her finger tightens on the trigger.
She sees the napkin on the dashboard.
She opens it up and reads it: "You're so cool".
<p ID="act">She tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase.
She looks around for, and finally finds, the "Sgt.
Fury" comic book Clarence bought her.
<p ID="act">And with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away from the Mustang forever.
<p ID="slug">FADE OUT
<p ID="act">THE END
