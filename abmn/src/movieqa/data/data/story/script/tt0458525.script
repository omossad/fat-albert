X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE
Written by
David Benioff & Skip Woods
A two-lane road carves through an endless forest of towering black spruce.
A flock of pintails skims over the treetops, heading south before the first snowfall.
A young BOY (12), undersized and feral, trudges home, bookbag strapped to his back.
Black-haired and pale-skinned, the boy looks as if he hasn't had a good meal in a long time.
Before we hear anything the boy turns, watching the bend in the road behind him.
After a moment we hear the thrum of a hard-charging engine.
An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend, accelerating as it hits the straightaway.
The boy steps away from the road but the car comes straight at him.
The boy closes his eyes.
The Oldsmobile's brakes clamp down on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to spare.
Laughter spills from the car's open windows.
Four HIGH SCHOOL LETTERMEN pile out of the car, wearing their leather-sleeved football jackets.
GILMAN, the largest of the four, shakes his head and laughs.
GILMAN Kid didn't even move.
GILMAN You see that?
GILMAN Where's your survival instincts, boy?
GILMAN The boy says nothing.
GILMAN He readjusts his bookbag and resumes his long walk northward.
GILMAN GILMAN (cont'd) Hey!
GILMAN Gilman grabs the boy's shoulder and spins him around- GILMAN (cont'd) The hell you going?
GILMAN You hear me talking to you?
GILMAN One of the other football players, MASON, walks over and inspects the boy's face.
MASON This is the kid whose old man robbed the truck stop last year.
MASON Gilman curls his meaty hand around the back of the boy's neck and pulls him closer, scrutinizing him.
MASON The four lettermen tower over the small boy.
MASON I C_ONTTNTT f 1
GILMAN You the one with the convict daddy?
GILMAN The boy stares back at Gilman, unblinking.
MASON That's him.
GILMAN What's the matter, you about to piss your pants?
GILMAN Answer me.
GILMAN The boy says nothing, never looking away from the bully.
GILMAN Gilman presses his fist, adorned with a heavy class ring, against the.boy's cheek.
GILMAN GILMAN (cont'd) You a tough guy like your daddy?
GILMAN Gilman shoves the boy, forcing him to stumble backwards.
GILMAN The boy regains his balance, never taking his eyes off Gilman.
GILMAN GILMAN (cont'd) You want to play tough guy with me?
GILMAN Huh?
GILMAN Provoked by the boy's lack of fear, by the insolence of his stare, Gilman rears back and punches him in the face.
GILMAN The boy falls to the ground.
GILMAN Blood spills from a gash in his cheek where the class ring cut him.
MASON Right cross to the face...
MASON and he's down!
MASON The football players laugh, looking down at the fallen boy.
MASON The boy stands.
MASON There is still no sign of emotion on his face.
MASON No fear, no anger, no evident pain.
GILMAN What's the matter?
GILMAN You want some more?
GILMAN The boy doesn't look away.
GILMAN The bully swings, cracking the boy in the side of the head, knocking him down again.
GILMAN GILMAN (cont'd)
GILMAN Let's get out of here.
CONTINUED (2) Walking back to the car, Mason slaps Gilman on the shoulder.
MASON You gave that little pissant something to think about.
MASON Gilman grins and looks back at the boy, expecting him to be sprawled and crying on the ground.
MASON Instead the boy stands again, brushes the dirt off his shirt, and walks toward Gilman.
GILMAN You got to be kidding me.
GILMAN I'm gonna knock the-- But Gilman's words die in his throat as he sees something impossible happening.
GILMAN The gash on the boy's cheek knits itself shut, leaving no sign of injury.
GILMAN Gilman is so shocked he doesn't see the boy's fist whizzing toward him, striking him in the nose.
GILMAN And then another punch.
GILMAN And then another.
GILMAN The boy is far smaller and weaker than Gilman, but he fights with a ferocity that seems inhuman, punching and kicking and headbutting, doing whatever it takes to fell his enemy.
GILMAN Gilman, stunned by the intensity of the assault, goes down, trying to protect his face from the blur of blows.
GILMAN Mason tries to pull the boy off his friend and suffers a bite to the hand.
GILMAN He howls with pain and backs off.
GILMAN The other two football players, amazed to see their leader getting pummeled by a boy half his size, watch in awe.
GILMAN The boy growls as he batters the bully.
GILMAN He grabs Gilman's collar and lifts the football player's head off the ground, prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist.
GILMAN Three bone claws spring from the boy's hand, serrated and razor sharp.
GILMAN Everything stops.
GILMAN Mason, clutching his wounded hand, quits hollering and stares.
GILMAN The other two football players blink and slowly back away.
GILMAN Even Gilman, moaning on the ground, hushes and tries to crawl backwards, away from this beast on top of him.
CONTINUED (3) But the boy is more shocked than-any of them.
CONTINUED (3) He stares with horror at the claws, this part of him he never knew existed.
CONTINUED (3) He stands and stumbles away from Gilman.
CONTINUED (3) Mason runs over, lifts his punch-drunk friend to his feet, and hustles him toward the Oldsmobile.
CONTINUED (3) The other football players pile in, slam the doors shut, and speed off, leaving the boy alone by the side of the road.
CONTINUED (3) The boy stares at his claws and for the first time we see fear in his eyes.
CONTINUED (3) He screams, a scream that echoes over the black spruce, into the darkening northern sky.
LOGAN wakes.
with a wordless shout, sitting upright, shirtless, in a bed covered with shredded bedsheets.
KAYLA SILVERFOX (25) wraps her arms around him and whispers in his ear.
KAYLA It's okay...
KAYLA shh...
KAYLA it's okay.
KAYLA Logan pants, chest heaving, eyes wild, gripping the tattered sheets in his fists.
KAYLA Kayla holds him tight until his bone claws retract.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) I'm right here with you.
KAYLA Okay?
KAYLA I'm right here with you.
KAYLA Kayla, a full-blooded Innu, wears her long black hair pulled back in a ponytail.
KAYLA She's been sleeping in one of Logan's flannel shirts.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) The war dreams or the one where you're a kid?
KAYLA Logan takes a deep breath, finally calming down.
KAYLA He relaxes into Kayla's arms.
LOGAN The one where I'm a kid.
LOGAN Kayla runs her fingers through his thick hair, kissing his forehead.
LOGAN He sees that she has a small cut on her forearm.
LOGAN He takes her arm and looks at the wound.
LOGAN (cont'd) I cut you.
KAYLA It's nothing.
KAYLA Just a scratch.
KAYLA She kisses him.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) We need new sheets again, baby.
A traveling carnival has come to a seaside New England town.
The brightly-lit Ferris Wheel spins a few hundred yards inland from the dark Atlantic.
LOCALS roam through the carnival, lining up to ride the Tilt- A-Whirl.
KIDS carrying plumes of cotton candy race from shoot- 'em-up games to free throw competitions.
A CARNY BARKER of the old school, wearing a patched-suit and a derby, beckons the curious to his attraction.
Come see the notorious Bird Man!
Half-man, half-eagle, is he an angel from Heaven or a spawn of Satan?
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight is your last chance to see the creature you've all been hearing about: We follow two BOYS who hand the barker their tickets, pull aside the curtain and step into the sideshow...
.joining a small crowd of CURIOUS ONLOOKERS.
The tent is dark save for a spotlight fixed on a tiny stage.
SHERRLENE, a peroxide-blonde in her fifties, whose tanned hide is covered with interlaced tattoos, slaps a tribal beat on a pair of bongos.
The crowd hushes.
A tall man in a hooded robe shuffles toward, the stage like a boxer long past his prime.
He stands in front of the gawkers, head bowed, face shadowed by his hood.
Finally BEAK throws off his robe and raises his wings to the crowd.
As advertised, he looks like an amalgam of man and bird, with three-toed, clawed feet and dirty-feathered wings.
His very human, tired brown eyes are set in a face dominated by a long sharp beak.
He stares back at the gaping crowd.
Beak looks more pathetic than monstrous.
His skinny limbs don't seem very strong and he projects an air of weary resignation, not menace.
But when he flaps his gray wings and caws at the onlookers, the children shriek in terror and bury their faces in their father's legs.
Sherrlene and Beak sit at a card table, playing gin and drinking bourbon.
SHERRLENE I'm gonna knock with three.
BEAK Are you kidding me?
BEAK He throws down his hand in disgust.
SHERRLENE You always hold out for gin.
SHERRLENE You could have knocked a while ago.
BEAK Yeah, well, I'm an eternal.
BEAK optimist.
BEAK Sherrlene tallies the points.
SHERRLENE All right, I'm gonna hit it.
SHERRLENE You want to come look for shells with me on the beach tomorrow?
BEAK I don't want to scare away any tourists.
SHERRLENE Aw, sweetie, it's winter.
SHERRLENE No tourists.
SHERRLENE I'll come get you in the morning.
SHERRLENE (rr)NTTNTrJ r) 1
Sherrlene collects her things, stands, and kisses Beak on the side of his feathered head.
BEAK Goodnight, Sherrlene.
SHERRLENE Night, Beak.
SHERRLENE Sweet dreams.
SHERRLENE Sherrlene closes the door behind her and Beak flips through the deck of cards, preparing for another lonely night.
SHERRLENE A knock on the door.
BEAK You forget your purse?
BEAK All right, all right, I'm coming.
BEAK He stands and opens the door.
EXT. BEAK'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS A towering figure in a long black coat looms beside the trailer's door.
BEAK Show's over, pal.
BEAK VICTOR CREED is shrouded in shadows, but when he grins his white fangs gleam.
BEAK He drapes his arm around Beak and drags the birdman inside the trailer.
VICTOR CREED Show's never over for you, freak..
BEAK You want money?
BEAK There's twenty bucks on the dresser.
BEAK That's all I
VICTOR CREED I just want to hear you talk a minute before I cut your lungs out.
VICTOR CREED Creed shoves Beak back into his seat, picks up the bottle of bourbon, examines the label, and guzzles it.
VICTOR CREED Beak opens his
mouth but no words come out.
Finally:
BEAK You're the one that's been killing mutants.
BEAK Creed wipes his lips with the back of his clawed hand.
BEAK BEAK (cont'd) But you...
BEAK you're one of us.
VICTOR CREED Us?
VICTOR CREED There's no us.
VICTOR CREED There's you and there's me, and in a minute, just me.
VICTOR CREED Creed smiles down at his feathered target.
VICTOR CREED Beak tries to shield his body with his wings.
BEAK Please...
BEAK I never hurt anybody, my whole life...
VICTOR CREED Let me show you how it's done.
EXT. BEAK'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS An awful, prolonged shriek escapes from the trailer.
The small log cabin sits in a clearing in a jack pine forest.
Winter has come to the north country; the ground and tree branches are covered with several inches of snow.
Logan chops firewood behind the cabin, splitting the logs with expert axe strikes, smoking a cheap cigar.
His nose wrinkles as he sniffs the air.
Smells like government.
Behind Logan, two approaching men in dark suits and black overcoats glance at each other.
Logan, halving another block of wood, doesn't turn around.
One of the newcomers, STRYKER, was a colonel in the Special Forces.
He still has the look.
His hair is cropped short, his bearing is military, and his blue eyes are fierce.
f r_ONTTNTJF D
CHRISTOPH NORD, A.K.A. AGENT ZERO, looks more like a death row convict than a military man.
A family of tattooed spiders walk down his neck.
I even showered today.
Logan turns, the axe gripped in his hand.
STRYKER (cont'd) Been a long time, Logan.
You haven't aged a day.
Everyone else gets old and gray, but not you.
LOGAN How'd you find me?
STRYKER We never lost you, my friend.
STRYKER I believe you know my colleague?
STRYKER Logan and Agent Zero stare at each other.
STRYKER There is a history between these two and clearly the memories are not fond.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) We're with the Department of Agriculture now.
LOGAN Agriculture?
LOGAN You working with farmers?
LOGAN Agent Zero grins.
LOGAN There is nothing pleasant about his grin,.
AGENT ZERO Pest Control Division.
AGENT ZERO Working with exterminators.
LOGAN Still shooting first, asking questions later?
LOGAN In one blindingly fast motion, Agent Zero pulls a customized automatic from his shoulder holster, fires, and reholsters.
AGENT ZERO Still smoking cheap cigars?
AGENT ZERO Logan spits the butt of the severed cigar from his mouth and clenches his fists.
LOGAN That was a buck twenty-five, asshole.
LOGAN Stryker holds up both hands, one palm to Logan, one to Zero.
STRYKER Boys, please.
STRYKER Could we take a minute of your time?
LOGAN You're taking it.
STRYKER We want you back.
STRYKER Logan turns away from them.
STRYKER He tosses aside the axe, picks up a load of firewood and .
STRYKER stacks.
STRYKER it beside the cabin.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) You're a born warrior.
STRYKER You can hide up here as long as you want, that's never gonna change.
LOGAN Not interested.
STRYKER It's...
STRYKER creative work, I can assure you of that.
STRYKER And it pays well.
LOGAN Already got a job.
AGENT ZERO Lumberjack.
AGENT ZERO Eighteen grand a.year.
LOGAN Eighteen five.
AGENT ZERO You content chopping down trees?
LOGAN Yeah, I am.
LOGAN It's good work.
LOGAN And I haven't killed anybody in three years.
AGENT ZERO Starting to miss it?
LOGAN Right about now I am.
LOGAN Agent Zero grins, enjoying the game.
LOGAN Stryker, seeing that this is going badly, tries to break the tension.
STRYKER We're putting together a team.
STRYKER Best men in the business.
STRYKER Men with...
STRYKER special qualities.
STRYKER Men like you.
LOGAN Forget it.
LOGAN Logan walks around to the front of the cabin.
LOGAN Stryker and Agent Zero follow.
LOGAN Logan's battered old pickup truck is parked beside the newcomers' Lincoln.
STRYKER It's a team of hunters.
STRYKER We're going after some very bad people.
STRYKER Logan climbs into the driver's seat.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) You read the papers, Logan?
STRYKER They're killing mutants.
STRYKER Logan closes the door, turns the key and revs the engine to warm it.
STRYKER Stryker taps on the window.
STRYKER Logan grits his teeth and rolls down the window, not looking at the colonel.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) Listen to me.
STRYKER They have names.
STRYKER They have addresses.
LOGAN I can take care of myself.
STRYKER All right, forget about yourself.
STRYKER Your country needs you.
LOGAN I'm Canadian.
LOGAN He hits the gas, forcing Stryker to jump back lest the tires run over his foot.
LOGAN Stryker and Agent Zero watch him go.
Logan parks in the lot of a sprawling brick grammar school.
He gets out of the truck and walks toward the main building.
The school day has ended.
STUDENTS meet up with their MOMS or DADS for the ride home.
As Logan rounds a corner, he stops in his tracks, looking around.
Something's not quite right.
Logan'ducks his head at the last.
possible second and a snowball whizzes past, missing him by inches.
Six FOURTH GRADERS (four boys and two girls) charge at him, hurling snowballs and screaming.
Get him!
Logan jumps back around the corner, out of sight.
The fourth graders chase after him, round the corner with their throwing hands cocked, ready to launch some serious ice.
Logan is nowhere in sight.
The fourth graders turn in confused circles, searching for their target, snowballs melting in their hands.
LOGAN Hey, fellas.
LOGAN The boys and girls look up and see Logan sitting on a second- floor window ledge.
LOGAN He has already formed six perfect snowballs, with which he proceeds to pelt the fourth graders.
LOGAN The kids run, screaming and laughing, nearly colliding with Kayla, who rounds the corner and stares up at Logan.
KAYLA Nice.
KAYLA Logan, caught with a snowball in his hand, looks sheepish.
LOGAN They started it.
Logan drives Kayla home over roads slick with black ice.
She sings softly along with the country song on the radio.
LOGAN Stryker came by the house today.
KAYLA Stryker?
KAYLA Colonel Stryker?
KAYLA The one you told me about?
KAYLA What did he want?
LOGAN Wants me back.
KAYLA And?
LOGAN Told him no.
KAYLA So why can't they get someone else?
KAYLA Logan thinks about it for a moment.
KAYLA When he speaks there is a degree of self-loathing in his tone.
LOGAN I'm the best there is at what I do.
LOGAN And what I do best isn't very nice.
LOGAN Kayla studies the side of his face for a moment.
LOGAN LOGAN (cont'd) Maybe he's right.
LOGAN Maybe it's the only thing I'm good for.
LOGAN Kayla watches him.
LOGAN Logan shakes his head as if ridding himself of an errant thought.
LOGAN LOGAN (cont'd) Son of a bitch had me thinking about it for a minute.
LOGAN He wraps his arm around her shoulders and pulls her closer.
LOGAN f CONTTN11Fn1
LOGAN (cont'd) I'm not going anywhere.
First time in my life, I don't feel like a freak.
KAYLA Hey.
KAYLA You're not a freak.
LOGAN Most guys don't have to worry about gutting their girlfriend when they have a bad dream.
KAYLA You're not a freak.
KAYLA You've got a gift.
LOGAN A gift?
LOGAN Logan shakes his head, staring at the black ribbon of road.
LOGAN LOGAN (cont'd) You can return a gift..
A well-built fire burns in the fireplace.
Logan and Kayla sit naked in front of it, wrapped in an old flannel quilt.
KAYLA The kids made cornhusk dolls today in Arts and Crafts.
KAYLA She reaches for her bag and pulls out a little doll.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) I made one for you.
KAYLA Kayla hands him the doll and he examines it by firelight.
KAYLA Given the limitations of the art form, it's a skillful representation of Logan, unique hairstyle and all.
LOGAN I look like Elvis.
KAYLA You're Elvis with claws.
KAYLA The moon, swollen and red-hued, rises above the dark hills, framed in the cabin's window.
KAYLA I coNTTNTTRn 1
LOGAN Full moon tomorrow.
KAYLA You know why the moon's so lonely?
KAYLA Logan shakes his head.
KAYLA Kayla lies back, resting her head on Logan's leg as he plays with her hair.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) She used to have a lover.
KAYLA Kuekuatsheu.
KAYLA They lived in the Spirit World and every night they'd wander the skies together.
KAYLA But one of the other spirits was jealous.
KAYLA Trickster wanted the Moon for himself.
KAYLA So he told Kuekuatsheu the Moon asked for flowers.
KAYLA He told him to come to our world and pick her some wild roses.
LOGAN Never trust a guy named Trickster.
KAYLA Yeah, well, you do some stupid things when you're in love.
KAYLA Kuekuatsheu didn't know that once you leave the Spirit World, you can never go back.
KAYLA Now he's trapped here.
KAYLA Every night the Moon searches for him and every night he sees her in the sky and howls her name...
KAYLA but he can never touch her again.
KAYLA For a moment they're both quiet, contemplating the sad myth.
LOGAN Koo-koo-choo got screwed.
KAYLA Kuekuatsheu.
KAYLA The Wolverine.
Viewed from a distance, the little cabin looks warm and inviting, the firelight shining from the windows.
Something watches from the edge.
of the dark woods.
Something monstrous, its black talons carving gashes in the trunk of a pine tree.
Kayla drops Logan off at the logging camp.
The site is already loud with motorized activity.
TRIMMERS remove the limbs from fallen trees.
TEAMSTERS in forklifts load logs onto flatbed trucks.
Logan comes around to the driver's side window, holding his orange Husqvarna chainsaw in one hand.
KAYLA Be careful.
KAYLA Logan bends forward to kiss her on the lips.
KAYLA He turns and walks towards a crew of LUMBERJACKS circled around a SUPERVISOR with a clipboard.
KAYLA Logan turns when he hears a honk.
KAYLA Kayla leans out the window.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) I love you, by the way.
KAYLA Logan notices that dozens of lumberjacks are watching this scene.
KAYLA He clears his throat.
LOGAN T love you, too.
We all love you, Casanova, but could we get to work here?
We need to let some daylight in the swamp.
The lumberjacks laugh loudly.
Damage done, Kayla waves a cheerful goodbye and drives away from the camp.
Logan trudges into the circle of lumberjacks, who make kissie- kissie sounds and slap his shoulder.
SUPERVISOR (cont'd) All right, I need a team of choppers for 3B, that's gonna be Phelan, Marcuse, Van Mier and Logan.
Two teams for 3C...
Kayla steers the pickup along the access road leading away.
from the logging camp.
C'C)NTTNTTF.n )
An eighteen-wheel flatbed loaded with trimmed logs blocks the road.
Men in reflective vests stand on the flatbed, securing the load with chains.
Kayla hits the brakes and checks-her watch.
She's late.
She taps the horn.
A FOREMAN ambles over to her, in no particular rush.
FOREMAN Can't move the truck till the load's tied down.
KAYLA Please?
KAYLA I'm already late.
FOREMAN Not gonna happen, ma'am...
FOREMAN The foreman thinks about it, sighs, and changes his tune.
FOREMAN FOREMAN (cont'd)
FOREMAN Hey Zeke!
FOREMAN Pull this mother over.
FOREMAN Lady's got to get through.
FOREMAN Moments later the truck rolls forward, enabling Kayla to scoot through in her pickup.
FOREMAN She toots her horn and waves.
KAYLA Thanks, fellas.
Logan and three other lumberjacks-- PHELAN, MARCUSE, and VAN MIER-- tramp through the woods towards their designated area, carrying their chainsaws and helmets.
Phelan, whiskey-bellied and flushed from the exertion, has fallen behind.
PHELAN You all want to ease the pace a little bit?
PHELAN Trees ain't going anywhere.
PHELAN Logan, in the lead, stares at a crude smiley face carved into a tall pine tree.
PHELAN His gaze travels from the carving to something sitting on the forest floor.
PHELAN (CON'TNt1F.n I
lB.
PHELAN (cont'd) What you got there?
The other lumberjacks gather around Logan.
A severed bear's head, haloed by buzzing flies, rots in the sun.
PHELAN (cont'd) Goddamn.
Hunter?
Why would a hunter leave the head?
LOGAN Bullet didn't kill this bear.
Claws did.
Kayla sings along with the tape on the tape deck.
KAYLA Lolly Lolly Lolly get your adverbs here, Lolly Lolly Lolly got some adverbs here, Come on down to Lolly's get the adverbs here...
KAYLA Rounding a corner on the narrow access road, Kayla nearly collides with a man in a long black coat.
KAYLA She slams on the brakes and the truck shudders to a halt.
KAYLA The man's back is turned to the truck, his head bowed.
KAYLA His hair hangs below his shoulders, clotted with dirt, as if he's been sleeping in the woods for weeks.
KAYLA Kayla leans out of the open truck window.
KAYLA Before she can speak, the man in the long black coat turns.
KAYLA It's not just his size that frightens us, though the man is massive.
KAYLA It's not just the four-inch-long black talons curling from his fingertips, or the gleaming fangs he licks as he smiles at her.
KAYLA What terrifies us most are his eyes.
KAYLA They are a shark's eyes, black and loveless and utterly inhuman.
KAYLA f CONTTNT1FD'
Victor Creed walks toward the truck.
He scrapes his talons over the hood: screeeeee.
Five parallel gashes now scar the hood, carved straight through the steel.
Logan, hearing a noise the other men can't, rises from his crouch.
He looks to the west, listening carefully.
PHELAN What's the matter-- Logan holds up a hand: quiet.
PHELAN He hears a distant scream.
PHELAN A.
PHELAN voice he knows better than any other.
PHELAN He runs, leaving his astonished co-workers behind.
PHELAN No one can run through the woods faster than Logan and'Logan has never needed to run faster.
PHELAN He vaults fallen trees, ducks under branches, accelerates when he hits the access road.
Logan sees the pickup truck in the distance.
Even a hundred yards away he can tell that something is.wrong.
It seems impossible that he could run any faster, but now he does, reaching the truck in seconds.
He sees the claw marks gouged through the steel hood.
He sees.the driver's side door tossed onto the asphalt twenty yards.
from the truck.
And finally he sees Kayla, curled in the fetal position on the side of the access road.
Blood puddles beneath her.
Her skin has already begun to lose its 'color.
He runs to her, kneels beside her body, hands checking for a pulse, listening for breath, trying desperately to find any sign of life in her lifeless form.
LOGAN Come on, you're okay.
LOGAN Say something.
LOGAN Say something, darling.
LOGAN Say something.
LOGAN Kayla, come on.
LOGAN He cradles her in his arms.
LOGAN LOGAN (cont'd) You're okay.
LOGAN You're okay.
He rocks back and forth, her lifeless body clutched tightly in his arms, his eyes clenched shut.
The veins bulge in his neck, every muscle in his body tenses, as if there were a beast inside him trying to break free of his skin.
The local dive opens early.
TOWN DRUNKS sit by themselves, smoking cigarettes, sipping the day's first hair-of--the-dog, reading the paper or staring into their beer.
Victor Creed sits at the bar, carving a crude smiley face into the wood with the claw of his index finger.
He looks up and sees the BARTENDER staring at him.
The bartender doesn't approve of the vandalism, but he's not about to say anything.
Creed taps the rim of his glass.
The bartender comes over with a bottle of George Dickel Tennessee whiskey.
He fills Creed's glass halfway-- a standard pour.
Creed stares at the bartender.
He taps the glass again.
The bartender, hand shaking, fills the glass to the brim.
Creed raises the whiskey to the light.
VICTOR CREED Stuff don't work on me.
VICTOR CREED I drink and drink and I never feel any different.
VICTOR CREED He downs the full glass of whiskey with a swallow.
VICTOR CREED He looks around the bar, at the pool table in the back, the Wurlitzer jukebox, the stacked bottles of liquor.
VICTOR CREED VICTOR CREED (cont'd) You got any insurance on this place?
Insurance?
I guess so.
Why?
Creed wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.
VICTOR CREED 'Cause it's about to get ugly.
VICTOR CREED Logan walks into the tavern, sniffing the air.
VICTOR CREED He sees Creed sitting on the barstool, back to the door.
Logan approaches the bar, never taking his eyes off creed.
Finally Creed turns to look at Logan.
He stands, towering above the smaller man.
Logan sees a splotch of dried blood on the back of Creed's hand.
Creed knows Logan is looking at it.
He lifts his hand to his mouth and licks the blood off.
VICTOR CREED (cont'd) Sweet girl.
Tasted like strawberry jam.
The bone claws burst from Logan's hands, pale, white, and serrated.
He growls and swings at Creed's head.
The big man is fast.
He ducks under the claws, grinning and circling like a boxer, happy that he's finally got a decent adversary.
The bartender and the local drunks have seen plenty of bar fights, but not ones featuring clawed mutants.
They run.
VICTOR CREED (cont'd) You can scare off the civilians with those, sonny boy.
But I got claws of my own.
He swings, raking his talons across Logan's chest, drawing first blood.
Logan lunges at Creed and the battle begins.
-The pace of the combat is startling, the physical power stupendous.
A missed swipe by Creed ends with him clawing out the guts of the jukebox.
Logan jumps at his enemy and gets swatted into the wall, smashing the plasterboard.
Creed grabs Logan by the collar and tosses him onto the pool table.
Creed brings his fist down, looking to pulverize Logan's skull, but the smaller man rolls clear.
Creed's fist shatters the slate and the table collapses.
Clearing his head on the sawdusted floor, Logan sees the eight ball rolling past.
He picks it up and hurls it at Creed's head.
Creed catches the eight ball in his left hand and squeezes his fist shut.
He opens his hand and lets the powdered remains spill onto the floor.
Logan springs to his feet and swings at creed, again and again, his claws whooshing through the air.

CONTINUED (2) VICTOR CREED (cont'd) You put up a better fight than your girl did.
CONTINUED (2) Creed snatches Logan and slings him headfirst through the plate glass window.
Logan hits the snow-covered pavement hard, splinters -of glass in his hair, his face bloodied from dozens of small cuts.
Creed steps out the bar.
As Logan struggles to his feet Creed kicks out his legs and drops him again.
Creed crouches beside Logan, grabs the back of his head, and smashes his face into the concrete.
The beating gets savage, creed hammering Logan again and again.
Logan's healing factor cannot keep up with the violence being done to his body.
VICTOR CREED Time you got declawed, kitty kat.
VICTOR CREED Creed lifts his heavy black boot and brings it down hard on the extended claws of Logan's left hand.
Logan howls as the-bone claws shatter.
Creed repeats the process on Logan's right hand.
VICTOR CREED.
(cont'd) You were a tough little guy.
But there's always someone tougher.
Creed plunges his clawed hand into Logan's chest.
Logan gasps, eyes widening.
His tolerance for pain is world-class but this is another level of suffering.
VICTOR CREED (cont'd) And it's always me.
Creed stands, staring down at Logan's unmoving body.
Sirens moan in the distance.
Creed walks away.
Logan bleeds in the snow.
We rise above him, higher and higher, his battered body dwindling as we rise with the smoke.
Two MALE NURSES shove a gurney down the corridor.
Logan is flat on his back, bloody and unconscious.
A SURGEON hurries after them, pulling on latex gloves.
SURGEON We know what we're looking at?
Bar fight.
Multiple knife wounds.
The male nurses transfer Logan from the gurney to the operating bed.
One FEMALE NURSE prepares Logan's arm for an IV while a second NURSE cuts open his blood-soaked shirt with surgical scissors.
The frenetic activity in the room ceases.
Everyone stares at Logan's unblemished chest.
SURGEON What is this?
Logan lunges forward, grabbing the surgeon's collar and pulling the startled man's face next to his own.
LOGAN Where is he?
Hey, hey, easy-- The male nurses struggle to restrain Logan but he's too strong for them.
The surgeon gasps for air.
LOGAN Where is he?
STRYKER His name is Victor Creed.
STRYKER Logan turns and sees Stryker standing at the entrance to the operating room.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) I can help you find him.
Logan storms out of the hospital, followed by Stryker.
STRYKER He escaped from an ultramax penitentiary in Nevada last year.
STRYKER Started murdering mutants.
STRYKER Shape- changer in New Mexico, pair of telekinetic twins in California-- Logan turns on Stryker, grabbing the colonel by the throat and shoving him against a lamp post.
LOGAN Three years I been here.
LOGAN Three years everything's good.
LOGAN Nobody knows me.
LOGAN And then one day you show up and the next day she's dead.
STRYKER I came to warn you--
LOGAN You knew he was coming.
LOGAN f CONTTNfJRD 1
Stryker shakes his head as well as he can with Logan's hand on his throat.
Stryker's face is turning red.
LOGAN (cont'd) How did you know?
STRYKER He got the List.
LOGAN What list?
LOGAN Stryker chokes, gasping for air.
LOGAN Logan eases up on his grip but doesn't release the man.
LOGAN Stryker takes a deep breath.
STRYKER The List.
STRYKER Every known mutant in North America.
STRYKER Government's been keeping it for years.
STRYKER Names, addresses, everything.
LOGAN How did he get it?
STRYKER Someone must have leaked it to him.
STRYKER There are people in Washington who want to see you all destroyed.
STRYKER Logan releases Stryker.
STRYKER The ex-colonel straightens his jacket collar and composes himself.
LOGAN Creed's a mutant, too.
STRYKER Apparently he doesn't have much tribal loyalty.
STRYKER Logan turns and walks away.
STRYKER He looks like a homeless man, his clothes torn and bloodied, his hair disheveled.
STRYKER He walks fast.
STRYKER Stryker calls after him.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) Do you have a plan, Captain?
LOGAN I'm not in the Army anymore.
STRYKER Do you have a plan?
STRYKER CnNTTNT TF.Tf 1
CONTINUED (2) Logan turns and stares at Stryker.
LOGAN I'm gonna track him down and I'm gonna end him.
LOGAN That's the plan.
STRYKER You already tried that.
STRYKER He's a hundred miles away and you're walking out of the hospital.
STRYKER Logan's fists are clenched.
STRYKER He's ready to hammer Stryker into the ground, but the older man does not back down.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) You can't beat him.
STRYKER Not the way you are right now.
STRYKER You've probably gone your whole life without losing a fight, but I'm telling you now, you can't beat him.
Unless I give you the tools.
Logan glares at Stryker, still itching for immediate revenge.
STRYKER (cont'd) You come with me, I promise you two things.
You will suffer more pain than any other man could bear.
And you will have your revenge.
Logan stares into Stryker's eyes.

A red-bearded scientist, DR.
CORNELIUS, draws blood from Logan with a syringe.
An Army surgeon, CAROL HINES, marks Logan's skin with an indelible pen.
He looks like a Maori warrior, his body mapped with strange lines, dots and x's.
Stryker watches Hines work.
STRYKER Could you unsheath your claws?
STRYKER Logan raises his left hand.
STRYKER The bone claws pop out, the same length they were before Creed shattered them.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) Remarkable.
STRYKER Full regeneration.
STRYKER Logan examines the markings on his forearm.
LOGAN The hell you planning on doing to me?
LOGAN Hines gives Stryker a worried look but he ignores her.
STRYKER We're going to make you indestructible.
STRYKER But first we have to destroy you.
STRYKER Stryker heads for the door but stops midway and turns.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) I forgot to give you something.
STRYKER He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out an old set of dog tags and tosses them to Logan.
STRYKER Logan inspects the tags with ambivalence.
LOGAN Never wanted to put these on again.
STRYKER Held on to them for years.
STRYKER Figured you'd be back one day.
STRYKER Logan slips the steel chain over his head.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd)
Now you'll always know your name.
Stryker walks down a long concrete corridor lit by fluorescent ceiling lights.
Hines steps out of the prep room and hurries after him.
HINES Sir?
HINES Stryker stops and waits.for her to catch up.
HINES HINES (cont'd) I know we've discussed this before-- He knows what she's going to say.
HINES He shakes his head and continues down the hallway, forcing Hines to chase after him.
STRYKER Ad nauseam, Lieutenant.
HINES Anesthetic won't work on him.
HINES His healing factor neutralizes drugs.
HINES Including painkillers.
STRYKER He can handle the pain.
HINES We've never conducted any animal
STRYKER No other animal would survive the experiment.
Logan, wearing a hospital-style robe, stands by the closed door.
No other human could hear the conversation down the hallway.
Logan catches every word.
HINES He might not, either.
HINES There's a significant chance the procedure will kill him.
STRYKER Correct.
STRYKER Some experiments succeed, some fail.
STRYKER That's why we call them "experiments."
STRYKER The man's well-being is not my concern.
STRYKER Proving that the science works-- that's what matters.
STRYKER Hines does not relish confrontation and she's afraid of Stryker.
STRYKER But she gives it one more try.
HINES Sir...
HINES I took the Hippocratic Oath.
HINES I swore I'd never intentionally harm another human being.
HINES Stryker turns on Hines, jabbing his finger at her.
STRYKER You also swore.
STRYKER to protect your nation.
STRYKER You remember that oath, Lieutenant Hines?
HINES Yes sir, but I don't understand why-
STRYKER I don't need you to understand.
STRYKER I need you to follow orders.
STRYKER Stryker continues down the corridor, leaving Hines standing alone in the fluorescent light.
Hines enters the room to find Logan sitting on the examining table, paging through a magazine.
He smiles up at her.
LOGAN You ready for me, Doc?
Hines and two MEDICAL TECHNICIANS accompany Logan to a water- filled plexiglass tank the size of a lidless coffin.
An array of stainless-steel machines crowds around the tank, including a series of robotic arms that taper into foot-long needles.
One wall of the theater is glass.
Behind the glass is the control room, where Stryker looks on, hands behind his back.
Dr. Cornelius and several SUPPORT STAFF enter data into computers monitoring the experiment.
Logan removes his robe and hands it to Hines before stepping into the tank of water.
LOGAN See you on'the other side.
LOGAN One of the technicians fastens a breathing tube, connected to an oxygen tank, to Logan's mouth.
LOGAN Logan lies down, submerging himself in the cold water.
LOGAN The technician clamps Logan's wrists and ankles into place with stainless-steel shackles bolted to the plexiglass walls.
LOGAN Logan's eyes are open as he watches the robotic arms swivel into place, poised above him like a gang of metal vipers.
GENERAL MUNSON stands in the back of the room, observing the experiment with great interest.
Agent Zero leans against the back wall, bored, cracking his knuckles.
Hines takes a seat beside Cornelius, who studies a readout on his computer screen.

GENERAL MUNSON Uncharted territory is a pretty good description of your budget, Colonel.
GENERAL MUNSON This doesn't work, you can kiss the Eleven good-bye.

Sparks dance like a swarm of fireflies.
The dismembered machines twitch like wounded beasts.
Logan rises from the broken tank, drenched with water, naked save for dozens of long stainless steel needles drilled into his body and the wires and hoses trailing from the needles.
Hair matted to his head, eyes wild, face contorted, he looks like a strange amalgam of machine and animal.
He tears the breathing tube from his mouth and stares through the window into the control room, panting, claws extended.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS Hines sits very still, hand over her mouth.

The other wolves in the pack stare at the strange champion.
Intense light shines on Logan's face.
He turns and sees that he's surrounded by a dozen SOLDIERS wearing tactical armor.
Powerful flashlights are mounted to the barrels of their guns, which are pointed at Logan.
The wolves flee, dodging through the pines, their paws kicking up snow.

James drives; his wife talks.
HEATHER HUDSON Marge'll probably make her walnut pie again.
HEATHER HUDSON I thought I'd do meringues this year.

James turns in time to see a naked man sprint across the snow and slip inside a red sheep barn.
HEATHER HUDSON (cont'd) I think there's a naked man in the barn.
JAMES HUDSON .yep.
James Hudson cautiously slides his barn door open.
He holds an old shotgun in his hands, a gun he hasn't fired in years.
He advances slowly into the barn, sunlight from the open door falling on the scattered straw.
A vintage motorcycle covered in a tarp stands near the side wall.
Hudson looks inside each sheep pen.
His thick-wooled SHEEP, ready for breakfast, bleat hopefully.
In the third pen Hudson finds Logan, who has covered himself with straw.
A few curious sheep sniff at the fugitive's face.
Hudson stares at Logan, who stares back somewhat, well, sheepishly.
JAMES HUDSON Son...
JAMES HUDSON What in hell are you doing?
LOGAN Sorry...
LOGAN It's a little cold out there.
JAMES HUDSON Uh huh.
JAMES HUDSON It's the middle of January and you got no clothes on.

LOGAN No sir.
JAMES HUDSON Just had a rough night?
LOGAN Pretty rough, yeah.
JAMES HUDSON All right, come on.
JAMES HUDSON I got some old clothes'll probably fit you.

JAMES HUDSON JAMES HUDSON (cont'd) I'll take you around back so my wife don't see you again.
LOGAN Sorry if I scared her.
JAMES HUDSON Scared her?
I'm not worried about you scaring her.
Logan sits at the breakfast table with James and Heather.
He wears an old plaid shirt, dungarees, and a pair of scuffed work boots.
A heaping breakfast lies before him: scrambled eggs, pork sausages, pancakes with maple syrup, a steaming mug of coffee.
Logan devours everything in front of him, looking up only to nod in thanks as Heather scoops more food onto his plate.
JAMES HUDSON You mind if I ask where you came running from?
JAMES HUDSON r()NTTNITF.n )
HEATHER HUDSON Jimmy.
HEATHER HUDSON Let the boy eat.
HEATHER HUDSON Logan piles eggs onto a slice of buttered toast.
JAMES HUDSON I'm just wondering.
JAMES HUDSON We're twenty miles from town.
JAMES HUDSON It's a miracle you didn't get hypothermia out there.
LOGAN I've got good circulation.
LOGAN Nice chopper you got out there, by the way.
LOGAN James's face lights up.
LOGAN Logan has found the man's passion.,
JAMES HUDSON You know motorcycles?
LOGAN What is it, '48 Panhead?
JAMES HUDSON Best bike Harley-Davidson ever made.
JAMES HUDSON First one with a seventy-four- cubic inch engine, hydraulic valve lifters, aluminum heads-- Heather stands to clear the plates.
HEATHER HUDSON Now you've got him started.
HEATHER HUDSON You need more of anything?
HEATHER HUDSON Logan, smiling, holds up his hands to surrender.
HEATHER HUDSON The smile fades when he sees the red laser dot appear on Heather's shirt.
HEATHER HUDSON HEATHER HUDSON (cont'd) What's the matter, honey?
HEATHER HUDSON Logan dives across the table, trying to knock her out of the way, but the bullet beats him there, punching through the window frame and straight through Heather Hudson's heart.
HEATHER HUDSON She collapses in Logan's arms.
But it's too late.

James Hudson restored this bike with love and elbow grease.
The chrome and leather shine as brightly as any new model on the factory floor.
The key is in the ignition.
This used to be a safe neighborhood.
EXT. SHEEP BARN - CONTINUOUS Logan bursts out of the barn on the Harley.
EXT. SHEEP BARN - CONTINUOUS The tires spin on the snow but Logan is an experienced rider.
EXT. SHEEP BARN - CONTINUOUS He steadies the bike, steers it onto the blacktop and accelerates, heading in the opposite direction from Agent Zero.
EXT. HUDSON FARM - CONTINUOUS Agent Zero grabs his rifle and jogs over to a black SUV with tinted windows and off-road tires.
EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY Logan speeds down the road, Agent Zero in hot pursuit.
EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY Zero gains ground, both hunter and quarry racing past 100 MPH.
Agent Zero grabs an Atchisson assault shotgun from a rack behind his seat that holds an impressive array of weaponry.
He lowers the passenger window and gets a bead on Logan, who swerves to keep himself (and his more fragile motorcycle) a tricky target.
EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY Agent Zero fires six shells in rapid succession.
EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY Hundreds of steel pellets scream over the motorcycle, perforating the face of a smiling farmer on a fertilizer billboard.
EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY Logan turns and sees the SUV closing on him.
EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY Agent Zero rams the bumper into the Harley and Logan very nearly loses control, managing to right the bike at the last second.
Logan accelerates and opens up thirty yards of breathing room.
He turns and sees Agent Zero catching up again.
Logan clamps on the brakes, hard.
He holds out his left hand and extends his claws.
The tips of the blades scrape the asphalt and sparks fly.
The SUV cannot brake in time.
As it hurtles past the motorcycle, Logan's claws hit the SUV's front tire and shred it instantly.
A split-second later he shreds the rear tire.
The SUV totters, falls to its side, and barrel rolls across the empty road.
It ends up on its roof in a drainage ditch, wheels still spinning in the air.
Logan turns his bike and pulls up next to the upended SUV.
He lowers the kickstand, stands, and walks to the driver's side.
Agent Zero, bloodied and dazed, has managed to push open the door.
He leans out and aims his shotgun at Logan, who slices the weapon into four pieces with a sweep of his claws.
Logan grabs Agent Zero by the back of the neck and hauls him out of the car.
LOGAN Those were good people back there.
LOGAN Innocent people.
LOGAN Agent Zero surreptitiously pulls a commando knife from a sheath on his ankle.
AGENT ZERO You ever notice good people tend to die when they spend time with you?
AGENT ZERO He swings the knife at the side of Logan's neck.`Logan catches Agent Zero's wrist and slams it against the door frame.
AGENT ZERO Agent Zero drops the knife with a pained smile.
AGENT ZERO He didn't think that would work.
AGENT ZERO AGENT ZERO (cont'd) Maybe you should stick with the bad people.
AGENT ZERO We're more your speed.
LOGAN I got a message for your boss.
Yeah?
Tell me.
The smirk fades from Zero's face as he sees the adamantium claws plunging toward his heart.
Logan stands at a pay phone beside the Texaco station, watching a couple of SKATEBOARD PUNKS practice their ollies.
He punches in a number and waits for the connection.
OPERATOR Department of Agriculture.
LOGAN Get me the Pest Control Division.
OPERATOR I'm sorry, sir, there is no Pest Control Division.
LOGAN Why don't you get 'em anyway.
LOGAN And tell 'em Logan's calling.
LOGAN While he waits he watches one of the kids attempt a backside tailslide on the curb.
LOGAN The kid loses his balance and wipes out, skinning his palms on the asphalt.
STRYKER Where are you?
LOGAN You shouldn't have killed those people.
LOGAN All they were doing was helping a stranger.
INT. STRYKER'S OFFICE - DAY Stryker sits behind the desk of his office.
INT. STRYKER'S OFFICE - DAY His aide, COLLINS, stands on the other side of the desk, listening in on an extension.
STRYKER You ran on me, goddamnit.
STRYKER We had a deal.
STRYKER Now you get back to base--
We continue to INTERCUT between the gas station and Stryker's office.
LOGAN They had nothing to do with this.
LOGAN You let that mad dog gun 'em down like they were animals.
STRYKER I'm giving you an order, soldier!
STRYKER Return tobase--
LOGAN Had enough orders for one lifetime.
I'm going after Victor Creed.
For several seconds there is silence on the line.
STRYKER We're bringing you in.
STRYKER One way or another, we're bringing you in.
STRYKER Logan bows his head, considering his next words.
LOGAN People like you are always waiting for the next war.
LOGAN You start one with me, Colonel, you better sleep with the lights on.
LOGAN He hangs up the phone and walks to his bike.
LOGAN The skateboard punks give him a wide berth.
Closing time at the big zoo and FAMILIES flock toward the parking lot.
SANITATION WORKERS clean the trash from the walking paths.
The lemur habitat is cultivated to mimic the environment of Madagascar.
Four RING-TAILED LEMURS swing from the branches of the baobab trees, shrieking at each other.
f rC)NTTNTTPD I
They congregate in a small wooden hut with a peaked roof, where they scamper up and down the back of FRANCIS, a slender, balding man in a zoo keeper's uniform.
Francis has a gentle smile as he feeds the lemurs leaf-eater biscuits.
He speaks to them as they shriek,: clambering over his lap, biscuits clutched in their tiny hands.
FRANCIS She did what?
FRANCIS Ninna, that wasn't very nice.
FRANCIS He gives one of the female lemurs an admonishing look.
FRANCIS She shrieks and dances away, biscuit held to her chest.
FRANCIS FRANCIS (cont'd) You must have done something to deserve it, Myrto.
FRANCIS Oh, you bit her?
FRANCIS Why?
FRANCIS Haven't we talked about this?
FRANCIS The lemurs all quiet down at the same time.
FRANCIS Francis watches them.
FRANCIS Something is wrong.
FRANCIS The lemurs flee, ducking into holes in the baobab trees, hiding from whatever's coming.
FRANCIS Francis frowns and turns.
FRANCIS Victor Creed stands above him.
VICTOR CREED Everyone thinks you're a lunatic, talking to animals.
VICTOR CREED But I know you're not, Francis.
VICTOR CREED You understand them, don't you?
VICTOR CREED That's your power.
VICTOR CREED Francis looks for help but there is no one in sight.
VICTOR CREED VICTOR CREED (cont'd) What do they tell you?
VICTOR CREED Francis is quiet for a few seconds, staring at the killer.
FRANCIS Nothing very fancy.
FRANCIS They tell me when they're scared.
FRANCIS When they're angry.
FRANCIS When they're hungry.
VICTOR CREED You ever talk to a panther, Francis?
VICTOR CREED Francis shakes his head.
VICTOR CREED CONTTNi7Ff)1
i? 1/2 1 VICTOR CREED (cont.'d) Every now and then a white panther comes along.
Albino.
The mama panther won't even look at it.
She won't lick it, she won't feed it, nothing.
So pretty soon the white panther dies.
You know why?
White panthers are mistakes.
And nature takes care of its mistakes.
FRANCIS There are no mistakes.
FRANCIS We're all part of the plan.
FRANCIS We're all God's children.
FRANCIS Creed grins, licking his sharp fangs.
VICTOR CREED I don't know who my Daddy was, but it sure as Hell wasn't God.
VICTOR CREED Francis bows his head.
FRANCIS I'm not afraid of dying.
FRANCIS Creed runs one long claw across Francis's cheek.
VICTOR CREED How do you know?
VICTOR CREED You've never done it before.
Ninna the ring-tailed lemur mewls softly, trying to hide herself deep within the baobab tree as her human friend
Logan, riding James Hudson's vintage motorcycle, rolls down the famous strip, lit by the mammoth neon signs above him.
He stops at a red light and stares at the lonely moon rising over the desert.
LADY OF THE NIGHT You look like a man who could use a night off.
LADY OF THE NIGHT (C fNTTNTTRT)1
Logan turns to look at a REDHEAD in a tight silver dress, waiting at the light in her Cadillac convertible.
She looks like she's expensive, and she looks like she'd be worth it.
LOGAN You're way out of my league, darlin'.
LADY OF THE NIGHT You never know.
LADY OF THE NIGHT You looking for a good time with a bad woman?
LADY OF THE NIGHT Logan smiles and shakes his head.
LOGAN Not tonight.
LOGAN The redhead purses her lips.
LADY OF THE NIGHT You don't know what you're missing.
LADY OF THE NIGHT Logan revs his engine as the light changes.
LOGAN I know exactly what I'm missing.
LOGAN The courtesan waits at the green light,.
LOGAN watching Logan speed off into the night -
In a seedy part of town, far from the casinos' bright lights, Logan walks through the front door of a rundown boxing gym.
Even at this hour the gym is packed with aspiring PUGILISTS.
Las Vegas has become the Mecca of world boxing, and many 'of the fighters here exhibit impressive skills as they batter the heavy bag, tap at the speed bag, and jump rope.
Logan walks toward a ring in the center of the gym.
Two young BOXERS inside the ropes, wearing headgear and sparring gloves, dance around throwing quick jabs that don't land.
JOHN WRAITH (45) stands outside the ring, watching this action with evident distaste.
He wears a black cowboy hat, sunglasses, and a handlebar mustache.
He has the swagger and drawl of a rodeo cowboy.
WRAITH This is a contact sport, ladies.
WRAITH If you don't like hitting people, try golf.
WRAITH Logan comes up behind Wraith, unseen by the Texan..
LOGAN You talk tough for a guy who always let me do the dirty work.
LOGAN A slow smile creases Wraith's face.
LOGAN He turns.
WRAITH Look at this.
WRAITH You never get old, do you?
WRAITH The two men'embrace.
WRAITH There is genuine affection here, the camaraderie of men who have fought together, bled together.
WRAITH WRAITH (cont'd) Nobody followed you?
LOGAN You tryin' to insult me?
WRAITH Can't be too careful, brother.
WRAITH I've been retired five years I still check under the car every time I drive.
LOGAN I'm looking for Victor Creed.
LOGAN Wraith's face goes serious at the mention of the name.
LOGAN He looks around the gym, making sure no one's watching them.
LOGAN He glances at the boxers in the ring, who lean on the ropes and breathe heavily, awaiting instructions.
WRAITH Why don't you two get a manicure or something and meet me back here in the morning.
WRAITH Want a beer?
LOGAN Always.
CONTINUED (2) Wraith leads Logan toward an office in the back, draping an arm around his shoulders.
WRAITH I love you like a brother.
WRAITH So I'm giving you thirty minutes.
WRAITH After that, you're too dangerous to know.
The windows in the office look out on the training boxers.
Wraith leads Logan inside and grabs two longneck bottles of beer from a mini-fridge.
WRAITH What I hear, our friend the Colonel's got eyes all over the country looking for you.
WRAITH He ain't about to let Weapon X go rogue on him.
WRAITH Wraith pops the caps off the beer bottles and hands one to Logan.
LOGAN What's Weapon X?
LOGAN They tap glass.
WRAITH You are.
WRAITH A walking, talking, hundred-million dollar experiment.
LOGAN You know about it.
LOGAN Wraith sits behind his desk and puts his boots up.
LOGAN Logan sits across from him.
WRAITH I keep my ear to the ground.
WRAITH People like us, we never really quit the game.
LOGAN I did.
LOGAN Woke up one day and knew I was done.
LOGAN Logan peels the label from his bottle of beer.
LOGAN f CONTTNTTFT) )
LOGAN (cont'd) Stryker used to give me a new name every Monday.
And by the end of the week, I'd draw a line through it.
I .put a whole lot of people under the ground.
And one day I realized...
Stryker was never gonna run out of names.
Wraith nods, meditative.
WRAITH Our friend the Colonel has big plans.
LOGAN What kind of plans?
WRAITH Hear a lot of chatter about something called the Eleven.
WRAITH My boys in Arlington say it's the biggest covert weapons project since FDR built himself an atom bomb.
WRAITH Other than that, no one knows a goddamn thing.
WRAITH Wraith places his bottle on his desk and sits up straight in his chair.
WRAITH WRAITH (cont'd) Look, I...
WRAITH I heard about what happened to your woman.
WRAITH For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
WRAITH Logan nods.
WRAITH He doesn't want to talk about it.
WRAITH WRAITH (cont'd) I did a little contract work with Creed back in the day.
WRAITH I've known some seriously foul people, but that cat...
WRAITH They say he took out a whole village in Nicaragua one time, every man, woman, and child, killed 'em all, just 'cause he was bored.
I been screwed, sued, and tattooed, but I never killed no kids.
LOGAN Creed did government work?
WRAITH Till they got wise to him.
WRAITH Wherever he went there was a trail of bodies.
WRAITH And not always the right bodies, you know what I'm saying?
WRAITH There is murder in Logan's eyes.
LOGAN Help me find him.
WRAITH He's a hard cat to track.
LOGAN Just tell me where to start looking.
LOGAN I'll do the rest.
LOGAN Wraith taps the bottleneck, considering.
WRAITH Might want to talk to his friends from the ultramax.
LOGAN The prison he busted out of?
Feds built it to hold the baddest of the bad mutants.
Worked pretty well.
Only problem-- now they all know each other.
You ever hear of a guy named Fred J.
Dukes?
LOGAN Nope.
WRAITH People call him the Blob.
WRAITH You find him, you'll know why.
WRAITH Got out of the hoosegow a few months ago.
WRAITH Went home to Iowa.
WRAITH Town called Elgin.
LOGAN You think he's still in touch with Creed?
LOGAN f C_ONTTNTIRT)1
CONTINUED (3) Wraith leans back in his chair and allows himself another slow smile.
WRAITH I bet you'll find out.
Logan, on his Harley, speeds past a welcome sign for Elgin, Iowa, Population 676.
The neon Vacancy sign shines, a beacon for tired travellers in the heartland.
Logan lies on top of the bed covers, hands behind his head.
The lights are out and Fox News plays on the television, casting the small room in blue light.
A REPORTER stands in a Detroit alleyway as POLICE OFFICERS in the background cordon off the area from ONLOOKERS.
This is the 13th confirmed mutant slaying of the last two months, and with the investigation apparently stalled, members of the mutant community are voicing their outrage.
A YOUNG WOMAN wearing a "Mutants are Humans, Too" t-shirt speaks passionately for the camera.
Of course there's bias at work here.
If these were normal people getting.
chopped up, you better believe there'd be an FBI Task Force investigating, there'd be all sorts of resources allocated to find this killer.
Why is it that when violence is done to our community, the nation turns its back?
YOUNG WOMAN (cont'd) If the government can't protect us, we're gonna have to start protecting ourselves.
In the corner of the TV screen, carved directly into the brick wall of the alley, is a crude smiley face.
Logan's expression does not change as he watches the report.
Our only indications that he's boiling inside are the look of dark vengeance in his eyes, and the fingers of his right hand, which clench into a fist, unclench, clench again.
He lowers the volume with the remote, picks up the telephone and dials a number.
We hear four rings.
KAYLA Hey, you've reached Kayla and Logan.
KAYLA We're not home right now so please leave a message after the beep and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
KAYLA Bye!
KAYLA Beep.
KAYLA Logan replaces the receiver in its cradle and' lies back, alone in the world.
A MOTHER pushes her shopping cart towards her minivan.
Her young, freckled SON holds her hand, gazing fearfully at Logan, who stands on the edge of the lot smoking a cigar.
He looks out of place in this quiet, Midwestern town.
Logan winks at the kid.
He drops his cigar, grinds it out with the toe of his boot, and heads for the supermarket.
Two STOCK BOYS, wearing bright blue vests over red shirts, stand at one of the aisle dividers, hiding behind a stack of breakfast pastries.
They are plainly terrified.
STOCK BOY #1 Say something.
You say something.
It's your section!
STOCK BOY #1 Dude...
STOCK BOY #1 The stock boy peeks around the divider.
STOCK BOY #1 FRED J. DUKES, a.k.a., THE BLOB, stands in the center of the aisle, tearing open bags of pork rinds and pouring them down his gullet.
STOCK BOY #1 Dukes is the biggest man you've ever seen.
STOCK BOY #1 By a long shot.
STOCK BOY #1 Just shy of seven feet tall and weighing in at half a ton, he's beyond fat.
STOCK BOY #1 Beyond obese.
STOCK BOY #1 His eyes look like pinpricks in the swollen enormity of his face.
STOCK BOY #1 When he shifts his bulk, ripples cascade down his flanks, his flesh trembling with each breath.
LOGAN Jesus, Dukes...
LOGAN Dukes, mouth and chin dusted with fried pork skin, turns his head to examine the pest standing next to him.
LOGAN LOGAN (cont'd) Maybe it's time to give the pork rinds a rest.
LOGAN Dukes swings his arm.
LOGAN Despite his enormous mass, the man moves with surprising speed.
LOGAN Not quick enough to catch Logan, though, who ducks beneath the blow.
LOGAN Dukes's forearm, thicker than a fire hydrant, smashes through the steel shelving.
LOGAN Bags of pork rinds and potato chips tumble to the floor.
LOGAN Snikt!
LOGAN Logan shows his glittering claws to the big man.
LOGAN LOGAN (cont'd) I'll fillet you standing, fat man.
LOGAN That what you want?
LOGAN Dukes hesitates.
LOGAN That is not what he wants., LOGAN (cont'd) .Where's Victor Creed?
LOGAN Dukes grunts and bulls forward, toppling the heavily-laden shelves into the next aisle.
LOGAN Panicked SHOPPERS scream and run for the exits.
LOGAN Dukes blasts through the cereal aisle, too, with a great rending of steel, his giant shoes crushing boxes of Lucky Charms as he stomps into the produce section.
LOGAN CONPTNi)F.T)1
CONTINUED (2) A coconut bounces off Dukes's head.
CONTINUED (2) Enraged, the giant turns and sees Logan standing by a pile of hairy coconuts, tossing one in his hand like a baseball.
CONTINUED (2) LOGAN (cont'd) You're gonna help me, bub.
CONTINUED (2) You_just don't know it yet.
CONTINUED (2) Dukes bellows and runs at Logan.
CONTINUED (2) A coconut pelts him in the face, angering him further.
CONTINUED (2) Logan jumps out of the way as Dukes brings down his massive fists.
CONTINUED (2) Coconuts explode.
CONTINUED (2) Dukes charges after Logan, shattering watermelons, stacked grapefruits, clusters of bananas.
CONTINUED (2) After a thirty second rampage Dukes is exhausted, his giant chest heaving as he gasps for air, his hands and face splattered with remnants of crushed fruit.
CONTINUED (2) Logan jumps onto Dukes' back.
CONTINUED (2) The fat man roars and spins around, trying to buck the little rider, but Logan's got one arm wrapped around Dukes' throat and he's not letting go.
CONTINUED (2) The spinning makes Dukes a little dizzy and he slows down.
CONTINUED (2) Three adamantium claws shine in the big fellow's face, reflecting the overhead fluorescent lights.
CONTINUED (2) Dukes quits, his massive shoulders slumping.
CONTINUED (2) He sinks to his knees, his great bulk splitting the linoleum floor.
CONTINUED (2) Logan presses his claws against Dukes' quivering jowls.
CONTINUED (2) LOGAN (cont'd) Where's Creed?
FRED J. DUKES How the hell would I know?
LOGAN Come on, he's your friend.
LOGAN When was the last time you talked to him?
FRED J. DUKES Friend?
FRED J. DUKES He don't have any friends.
FRED J. DUKES All he's got is victims.
LOGAN Careful, Dukes.
LOGAN I can smell a lie before you even tell it.
LOGAN The Blob begins to cry, the great bellows of his cheeks trembling, tears and snot dribbling down his face.
FRED J. DUKES I'm not lying!
FRED J. DUKES I don't know where he is.
FRED J. DUKES Logan pulls a handkerchief out of his back pocket and hands it to Dukes.
LOGAN All right, take it easy.
LOGAN Dukes blows his nose into the handkerchief, one of history's loudest and most violent nasal ejaculations.
LOGAN He offers back the soiled handkerchief.
LOGAN Logan waves it off.
LOGAN LOGAN (cont'd) It's a gift.
LOGAN Dukes takes a deep breath, gathering himself.
FRED J. DUKES You ever been to Superior?
LOGAN The club for mutants?
LOGAN Down in New Orleans?
FRED J. DUKES Creed likes to party down there.
FRED J. DUKES Talked about it all the time-- how hot the girlies were.
FRED J. DUKES That's all I know.
FRED J. DUKES Logan shaves Dukes' jaw with the edge of his claw.
LOGAN Nah.
LOGAN You know more than that.
LOGAN Dukes tilts his face, trying to keep his face from getting scraped off.
FRED J. DUKES Joint's owned by a guy named Barbarus.
FRED J. DUKES Shared a cell with Creed in the ultramax.
FRED J. DUKES Anyone knows where to find him, it's Barbarus.
FRED J. DUKES Logan stares into the Blob's face, gauging the man's words.
LOGAN He better be there, Freddie.
LOGAN And he better know something good.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY Stryker stands by a window-overlooking Alkali Lake while General Munson sits at the head of the conference table.
STRYKER we have information that he was in Las Vegas two nights ago.
STRYKER We'll find him soon.
GENERAL MUNSON This is turning into a goddamn disaster, Colonel.
STRYKER I disagree.
STRYKER I'd say the experiment has been a success.
GENERAL MUNSON Success?
GENERAL MUNSON Are you kidding me?
STRYKER Weapon X is a prototype.
STRYKER Nothing more.
STRYKER He's the walking proof that enhanced skeletons are viable.
STRYKER That, along with the healing factor we've replicated from his blood, will insure that the Eleven is capable of protecting our species from extinction.
At this point, Logan is merely an inconvenience.
He won't be for long.
GENERAL MUNSON I'm sorry, William.
GENERAL MUNSON I've lost confidence in your leadership.
GENERAL MUNSON I'm going to recommend your dismissal to the Joint Chiefs.
GENERAL MUNSON Stryker stares out the window at the distant lake, with no visible reaction to the General's words.
STRYKER Disappointing, General.
STRYKER Expected, but still...
STRYKER disappointing.
General Munson takes a sip of water from the glass in front of him.
GENERAL MUNSON I know you believe in what you're doing.
GENERAL MUNSON But I don't.
GENERAL MUNSON War with the mutants is not inevitable.
GENERAL MUNSON The general coughs.
GENERAL MUNSON He begins to look confused as he coughs again, his breathing gone suddenly ragged.
GENERAL MUNSON He clutches at his chest.
GENERAL MUNSON A thin smile curls Stryker's lips.
GENERAL MUNSON He turns to regard the General.
STRYKER You're having a massive heart attack, sir.
STRYKER Leading cause of death for men in your age bracket.
STRYKER The general gasps for air, trying to rise to his feet.
STRYKER In his death throes, he knocks the glass of water from the table.
STRYKER It shatters on the floor.
STRYKER STRYKER.(cont'd) The war is coming.
STRYKER It's time to choose sides.
STRYKER The general collapses-and Stryker stands above him, staring down at the dying man with pitiless eyes.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) You chose treason.
A heavy rain falls in the French Quarter.
There is no sign outside the club, only.a gargantuan BOUNCER standing in front of an unmarked door in a dark alley.
The bouncer apprises the stocky mutant walking his way.
You superior?
Only when we go CLOSE ON THE BOUNCER do we realize he has a single eye, large and bloodshot, centered in his forehead..
Logan raises both hands.
Snikt!
A single claw extends from his right hand.
He shoves the claw straight through his left palm, retracts the blade, and shows his wounded palm to the bouncer.
The bouncer sees the wound heal and opens the door.
BOUNCER (cont'd) Welcome home, brother.
The dimly-lit club is the size of a warehouse and jammed with PARTYING MUTANTS.
Most of them look like normal humans but a few are "overts," distinguished by curling horns, scaled skin and other genetic abnormalities.
A sexy WAITRESS walks by with a tray of drinks.
She winks at Logan.
A "Kiss Me, I'm a Mutant" button is pinned to her shirt.
Industrial beats pour out of speakers bolted to the ceilings.
Logan surveys the room.
A young PUSHER approaches, his long sideburns shaved into scimitars running down his jawline.
PUSHER You lookin' for help, man?
PUSHER Ups, downs, in-betweens.
PUSHER What you need?
LOGAN Wild roses for the moon.
PUSHER Wild roses...
PUSHER That some new hash out of Amsterdam?
LOGAN Something like that.
LOGAN You seen my buddy Barbarus?
LOGAN The dealer points toward a staircase at the back of the club.
PUSHER VIP room.
PUSHER But hold up,bro,.I got what you're looking for.
LOGAN Trust me, bub-- you don't.
LOGAN Logan heads for the staircase.
Logan tries to enter the VIP room but a muscle-bound SKINHEAD with Mutant Power brands on his biceps blocks his path.
SKINHEAD Private party.
LOGAN I'm on the list.
LOGAN Logan.
LOGAN The skinhead raises his clipboard and examines the list.
SKINHEAD Last name?
SKINHEAD Logan's fist splits the clipboard and crushes the skinhead's nose.
SKINHEAD The muscle-bound brute slumps to the floor, unconscious.
SKINHEAD Logan steps over him and into the VIP room.
LOGAN Unknown.
The VIP MUTANTS -sit at plush booths, downing shots of tequila.
They grope their GIRLFRIENDS.
They arm wrestle and compare tattoos and gobble down fried oysters.
BARBARUS sits in a corner booth.
He wears a custom-made wife- beater.
The brutally-muscled mutant has four arms, all sleeved in tattoos.
One hand pours himself a new glass of Jack Daniel's.
A second hand gouges his name into the table top with a black steel commando knife.
The third drums the beat of the current song on the vinyl booth's backrest.
The fourth hand pets PANTERA, the nubile mutant sitting on his lap, a beautiful young woman entirely covered in glistening black fur.
Her yellow eyes glitter.
Logan approaches the table.
Barbarus stares up at him.
Pantera purrs, yellow eyes on Logan.
BARBARUS Oh, I heard about this li'l fella.
BARBARUS Mr. Creed beat him to hell.
LOGAN I came back.
LOGAN Where is he?
BARBARUS Somewhere in America.
BARBARUS Doing what he does best.
LOGAN What's that?
BARBARUS Putting people's insides on the outside.
LOGAN He's killing mutants, bub.
LOGAN Barbarus smiles, twenty fingers drumming on the table top.
BARBARUS Some mutants need killing.
LOGAN You got that right.
LOGAN Snikt!
LOGAN Barbarus shoves his girlfriend out of the way and stands, unsheathing three more black commando knives from his belt.
LOGAN The other MUTANTS quiet down, watching the fireworks.
LOGAN Barbarus swings, the four knives whistling through the air.
LOGAN Logan ducks under them and continues to bob and weave as Barbarus advances behind a whirlwhind of black steel.
LOGAN Logan slashes and one severed hand falls to the ground.
LOGAN Barbarus howls, stabbing at Logan with his three good arms.
LOGAN Logan's claws flash through the air again, and another neatly severed hand lands on the table.
LOGAN Logan retracts his claws and curls one finger: come at me.
LOGAN Barbarus, shamed and furious, gathers himself and charges.
LOGAN Logan times his punch perfectly, pivoting on the ball of his foot and hitting Barbarus with an uppercut that sounds like a well-hit baseball.
LOGAN Barbarus crashes to the floor.
LOGAN Pantera hisses and pounces at Logan, her black claws aimed at his face.
LOGAN Logan backhands her.
LOGAN She hits the floor and slides across the hardwood.

BARBARUS He don't sent me postcards.
LOGAN No?
LOGAN Way I hear it, you two were practically boyfriends before he busted out.
BARBARUS Busted out?
You been misinformed.
Victor Creed got himself a government pardon.
Some fellas from the Department of Agriculture came and picked him up.
LOGAN You're lying to me.
LOGAN Barbarus grins, his teeth red from the blood in his mouth.
BARBARUS No, sir.
BARBARUS But somebody is.
A five-story concrete parking structure on the edge of Las Vegas.
John Wraith walks to his black.'68 Mustang, whistling a Jerry Jeff Walker song.
When he gets to the car he drops to the floor and checks the underbody for bombs.
Nothing down there.
He stands, reaching into his pocket for his keys.
VICTOR CREED You think I'd use a bomb on you, Johnny Boy?
VICTOR CREED Wraith spins around.
VICTOR CREED Victor Creed sits on a concrete parapet, the desert wind blowing his filthy blonde hair.
VICTOR CREED He hops off the parapet and walks toward Wraith.
VICTOR CREED (cont'd) It's all about human contact for me.
Wraith quickly unlocks the car door and get in.
He slips the key into the ignition.
The engine turns on the first try.
Wraith hits the gas and the Mustang squeals out in reverse.
He slams on the brakes, shifts into drive, and guns the car right at Creed.
An instant before impact, Creed sidesteps the car and punches through the driver's window.
It's a miracle of a punch, timed perfectly, a crushing shot to Wraith's jaw.
Wraith loses control.
of the car and it sideswipes a parked Hummer, spinning to a stop against a concrete wall.
Wraith blinks and tries to clear his head.
Creed reaches inside the broken window and hauls the Texan out.
He lifts the bleeding man into the air and flashes his white fangs.
VICTOR CREED (cont'd) Hear you been talking out of school.
WRAITH He'll find you.
VICTOR CREED That's the plan.
VICTOR CREED It's a lot easier than finding him.
VICTOR CREED Creed slams Wraith against the concrete wall and plunges his claws deep into Wraith's gut.
VICTOR CREED The Texan's mouth opens as the full force of the pain hits him.
VICTOR CREED Creed whispers in his ear.
VICTOR CREED VICTOR CREED (cont'd) I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.
VICTOR CREED A sickening crunch as vertebrae are crushed like walnut shells.
VICTOR CREED VICTOR CREED (cont'd) Never knew you had one.
VICTOR CREED Creed drops Wraith's body to the ground.
Carol Hines, the Army surgeon last seen in Alkali Lake, unlocks her front door and steps inside her house.
she looks exhausted, with deep circles under her eyes.
She puts her keys and the mail on a table by the door and then looks up, startled, when she hears SHRIEKING.
Hines, very nervous, advances into the dark kitchen.
She flicks on the lights.
A red kettle on the stove top whistles.
A mug waits on the counter.
Hines, mystified, turns off the burner.
Pour yourself a cup of tea.
Hines spins around.
Logan sits at the kitchen table, an unlit cigar in his mouth.
LOGAN (cont'd) It's gonna be a long night.
They both sit at the kitchen table now.
Logan smokes his cigar and watches Hines, who clutches her mug of tea with trembling hands.
Logan watches her through the haze of smoke.
LOGAN Careful, Doc.
LOGAN I can smell a lie.
LOGAN I can hear it.
LOGAN Maybe you start to sweat a little bit.
LOGAN Maybe the pitch of your voice changes.
LOGAN But I'll know.
Tell me about Creed.
Hines opens her mouth, closes it, opens it again.
HINES I can't.
HINES Please...
HINES you don't know what they'll do to me.
LOGAN Nope.
LOGAN But I know exactly what I'll do to you.
LOGAN (rnNTTNT1FT) I
Hines stares at Logan and he stares back.
HINES I don't believe you.
HINES You're different than they are.
HINES You wouldn't hurt an innocent person.
LOGAN You're not innocent, Doc.
LOGAN He leans forward, forearms on the tabletop.
LOGAN LOGAN (cont'd) What does Victor Creed have to do with the Weapon X program?
HINES It's not the Weapon X program, it's the Weapon Ultra program.
HINES Started sixty-five years ago.
HINES They've been trying to make the perfect soldier for a long time.
HINES First to fight the Nazis.
HINES Then the Communists.
HINES Now it's mutants.
LOGAN So where does Weapon X fit in?
LOGAN Hines closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.
HINES You don't understand.
HINES X is a letter but it's also a Roman numeral.
HINES Weapon "Ex" is a nickname.
HINES Officially, you're Weapon Ten.
Victor Creed is Weapon Nine.
Hines watches him, unsure how he'll react.
HINES (cont'd) Both of you are experiments...
prototypes.
The final product is almost ready.
Weapon Eleven.
Logan's face darkens as the extent of his betrayal becomes clear to him.
LOGAN Creed works for Stryker.
LOGAN Hines nods.
LOGAN I CONTTNi]RM
CONTINUED (2) LOGAN (cont'd) Be ordered it.
CONTINUED (2) He ordered Creed to kill her.
CONTINUED (2) Hines can see Logan's mounting fury.
CONTINUED (2) She holds up her hands.
HINES I don't know about anyone getting killed.
HINES I'm just a scientist.
HINES I work in a lab sixteen hours a day.
LOGAN Just following orders, huh?
HINES He was your commanding officer for years.
HINES How many people did you kill on his orders?
HINES Logan stares at her for a long count.
HINES she stares back, terrified but resolute.
LOGAN All this time I been hunting Creed, and he's just a puppet.
LOGAN It's Stryker pulling the strings.
LOGAN He stubs out his cigar on the breakfast table.
LOGAN LOGAN (cont'd) You ready to stop following orders?
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY Stryker stands at the window overlooking Alkali Lake.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY Dr.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY Cornelius steps into the room, holding a black leather case.
CORNELIUS The Eleven will be ready within 24 hours.
STRYKER Good.
CORNELIUS Sir...
CORNELIUS Lieutenant Hines hasn't reported to base today.
STRYKER Hines?
Stryker considers the information for a moment and nods.
STRYKER (cont'd) All right, thank you, Doctor.
What's this?
Cornelius sets the case on the table and opens it.
Six gleaming, armor-piercing bullets rest in green felt niches.
CORNELIUS We saved the leftover adamantium from the Weapon X procedure.
CORNELIUS Stryker plucks one of the bullets from its niche and rolls it between his fingers, examining it with a practiced eye.
CORNELIUS CORNELIUS (cont'd) Each one's got a high-explosive core.
CORNELIUS Two in the head and Logan's brain will have to regenerate from scratch.
STRYKER They won't kill him?
CORNELIUS According to the computer models we ran, there's a 30 percent chance his healing factor will reconstitute the gray matter.
CORNELIUS But those synaptic bridges that form our memories?
CORNELIUS Gone.
CORNELIUS If he survives, his brain will come back fresh.
STRYKER A blank slate...
STRYKER easy to train.
STRYKER Stryker fondles the shining bullet lovingly.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) She's a pretty little thing.
CORNELIUS She ought to be.
CORNELIUS That's the world's most expensive bullet.
CORNELIUS Stryker pulls a revolver from his shoulder holster, dumps the standard rounds, and begins loading the adamantium bullets.
CORNELIUS (rfNTTN11F.T 1
CONTINUED (2) CORNELIUS (cont'd) There's another way, a more reliable way, to break down his memory.
STRYKER Mm?
CORNELIUS Only problem is, the procedure can only be done here at Alkali Lake.
CORNELIUS Stryker swings the chamber shut and holsters his gun.
STRYKER Oh, he's coming back, Doctor.
STRYKER We have what he's looking for.
EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY Hines, driving an old Ford, pulls up.to the guard house at the perimeter of the compound.
EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY A YOUNG SENTRY salutes her.
YOUNG SENTRY Morning, Lieutenant.
YOUNG SENTRY Hines smiles brightly, trying to hide her nervousness.
HINES Good morning!
HINES The sentry looks into the car's cabin.
HINES The passenger seat is empty.
HINES The back seat is empty.
YOUNG SENTRY Could you pop the trunk for me?
HINES The trunk?
YOUNG SENTRY Yes, ma'am.
YOUNG SENTRY It's all standard procedure but Hines is close to panicking.
YOUNG SENTRY She opens the glove compartment and hits the trunk release.
YOUNG SENTRY The sentry inspects the trunk...
YOUNG SENTRY nothing but a coil of rope and a roll of electrical tape.
YOUNG SENTRY He slams the trunk door.
YOUNG SENTRY YOUNG SENTRY (cont'd) You have a good day.
He signals to a second SENTRY standing inside the guard house, who hits a button.
The steel gate rolls open and Hines drives into the compound.
Hines steps out of her parked car and looks around.
No one is in the immediate vicinity.
HINES It's safe.
HINES Logan crawls out from the underbody, where he had been clinging.
HINES He dusts himself off.
LOGAN Were you aiming for every speed bump in the state?
HINES Sorry about that.
HINES Now what?
LOGAN We find a uniform that fits.
LOGAN A well-built SERGEANT walks toward his vehicle, paging through requisition papers on a clipboard.
LOGAN LOGAN (cont'd) That ought to work.
Hines and Logan, who now wears a crisp uniform with a sergeant's stripes and a black beret, walk into the building.
HINES You have some blood on your shirt.
HINES Logan sees the drops of blood and tries to blot them out.
LOGAN I barely hit the guy.
LOGAN They don't notice as a small security camera near the entrance pivots, its black eye watching the intruders.
Hines, very nervous, tries to keep her composure.
Logan puts a hand on her shoulder-- partly to steady her nerves, partly to keep pushing her forward.
LOGAN (cont'd) Time to visit the Colonel.
Hines and Logan walk down a long corridor.
Several SOLDIERS and SCIENTISTS walk by, most of them ignoring the pair.
One young scientist in a lab coat hurries past, nodding at Hines.
Lieutenant.
Murphy.
Hines waits till Murphy passes.
She stops in front of a locked door and allows a laser scanner to read her retina.
The door slides open.
Logan looks through the open doorway, his nostrils flaring.
He looks primed for homicide.
LOGAN I can smell him.
LOGAN He walks through the door.
LOGAN Hines checks to see if the coast is clear.and follows him.
LOGAN Neither notices the security camera mounted on the ceiling, swiveling to track their movement.
Logan and Hines stand at the top of a steel staircase, forty feet above the concrete floor of a massive cavern.
Created in the 1960s by an underground hydrogen bomb test, the Alkali Lake cavern is the second biggest in the country, smaller only than the salt caverns of the Gulf Coast, home of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
The sheer scale of the place is staggering.
Three times the size of the Super Dome, with walls of rough granite, the cavern is loud with the constant thrum of ventilation and high-powered machinery.
Heavy steel pillars support the ceiling of the cavern.
Ten thousand stainless steel isolation tanks crowd the floor, arrayed in a grid, each tank slightly larger than a coffin.
TECHNICIANS walk in between the tanks, checking gauges, writing notes in clipboards.
More technicians sit on a raised podium in the center of the cavern, overlooking the Eleven, entering information into the computers that monitor the sleeping army.
Logan is awed by the sight.
Hines has descended the staircase ahead of him.
He follows after her.
HINES Welcome to Weapon Eleven.
I thought it was just gonna be one guy.
This is...
HINES Ten thousand.
HINES They reach the cavern floor and walk amongst the Eleven.
HINES HINES (cont'd) Stryker says mutants and humans will fight a war soon.
HINES This is his army.
HINES The camera glides over the isolation tanks as Hines continues to speak.
HINES We catch glimpses of the ELEVEN inside, comatose soldiers with needles and wires protruding from their skin, exactly like Logan during the Weapon X procedure.
HINES The men all look identical and they all look oddly familiar.
HINES HINES (cont'd) They incorporate the most successful features of the previous Weapons.
HINES Enhanced skeletons, heightened senses, healing factor-- f r0NTTNTTF.T) I
CONTINUED (2) Logan stops beside one tank and looks at the man inside, who floats in his chemical sleep.
CONTINUED (2) His eyes widen when he realizes what he's looking at.
LOGAN It's Creed...
LOGAN He looks inside another tank.
LOGAN Same cruel face, same powerful body.
LOGAN Only their shaved heads distinguish them from Victor Creed.
LOGAN LOGAN (cont'd) They're all Creed.
HINES Stryker's most successful mutant hunter.
HINES They cloned him years ago.
The Colonel's been planning this for a long time.
_ Logan walks through the midst of this vast, sleeping army, surrounded by ten thousand replicas of his worst enemy.
LOGAN They get into the world, it's genocide.
HINES I think that's the general idea.
HINES Logan stops in mid--stride, head raised in the manner of a hunting dog who has just caught wind of his prey.
HINES HINES (cont'd) What's the matter?
HINES Logan moves, walking quickly, nearly knocking over a technician entering data into one of the stasis pods.
Hey...
Hines hurries after Logan, smiling apologetically at the annoyed technician.
HINES Where you going?
HINES Logan never turns.
HINES f rONTTNUT n %
LOGAN Don't follow me.
LOGAN Hines stops, standing alone in the middle of the Eleven.
Logan walks rapidly down the hallway, his pace accelerating as he nears a closed doorway.
He rests his head against the door for a moment before putting his hand on the knob and entering the room.
Stryker sits behind his desk, smiling at Logan.
But Logan's not looking at the colonel.
He's looking at the young woman who sits across from Stryker, her back to the door.
She doesn't turn.
Her long black hair cascades down her back.
STRYKER Hello, old friend.
STRYKER We've been waiting for you.
STRYKER Logan walks toward the desk, slowly now, a man in a nightmare he can't wake from.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) Did you really think we just let you walk away three years ago?
STRYKER You're a dangerous man, my friend.
STRYKER We like to keep an eye on dangerous men.
STRYKER When Logan reaches the young woman he puts his hand on her shoulder.
STRYKER Kayla Silverfox turns and stares up at him, tears streaming down her face.
KAYLA I'm sorry.
KAYLA I'm so sorry.
KAYLA An aluminum baseball bat whirs through the air, smashing the back of Logan's head.
KAYLA Logan falls to the floor, unconscious.
KAYLA Victor Creed stands above him, staring at the flattened barrel of the baseball bat.
KAYLA f nNTTNITFT)1
VICTOR CREED Man's got a hard head.
Let's go.
He'll only be out for a couple minutes.
Creed tosses aside the bat and lifts Logan onto his shoulders as easily as a normal man would lift a child of six.
He carries Logan out of the room, winking at Kayla.
Logan, still unconscious, sits on a chair that looks far too similar to an electric chair, his arms and legs bound with titanium manacles that prevent any movement.
The room looks like an execution chamber, complete with a viewing window.
He opens his eyes and blinks in the bright light.
Stryker and Creed stand in front of him but Logan doesn't look at them.
Dr. Cornelius and an ASSISTANT stand near a machine that is wired to the electric chair, fiddling with the controls, but Logan doesn't look at them, either.
He stares at Kayla, who cannot meet his eyes.
LOGAN Who are you?
KAYLA You know who I am.
LOGAN No I don't.
STRYKER She's real, old friend.
STRYKER Your eyes are telling you.
STRYKER Your ears.
STRYKER Your nose.
STRYKER Logan ignores Stryker, staring at the love of his life.
LOGAN You're dead.
STRYKER I asked you nicely to join the program.
STRYKER And you were so stubborn.
STRYKER But I knew if nothing else could motivate you, revenge would.
STRYKER Stryker smiles at Kayla, a proud professor beaming at his student.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) Tell him.
STRYKER Tell him about the day you died.
STRYKER Kayla, head bowed, is silent for a long count.
STRYKER When she speaks her voice is a strange monotone, devoid of feeling.
KAYLA They gave me a syringe full of hydrochlorothiazide.
Perhaps the colors are desaturated to let us know that this is a scene we've witnessed before, or thought we did.
Kayla sits behind the wheel of her pickup.
Victor Creed walks toward her, black talons raking five gashes on the hood.
Kayla has been expecting him.
She pulls her backpack out from behind the seat and takes from it a hypodermic needle and a plastic IV bag filled with dark blood.
Creed tears the truck's door off its hinges and tosses it twenty yards.
Kayla injects herself with the hypodermic.
Reduces the heartbeat to almost zero.
Breathing virtually stops.
Makes you flatline for six minutes.
Kayla hops down from the truck.
She holds out the IV bag to Victor, who casually pierces it with his claw.
KAYLA (V.0.)
(cont'd) I'd been drawing my own blood every night for the past week.
I had four liters ready that morning.
Kayla smears.
her own blood on her body and empties the rest of the bag on the pavement.
She lies down in the puddle in a fetal position, her breathing already beginning to slow.
LOGAN Why?
Same as Victor.
Stryker gave me a I choice: spend the rest of my life in prison or come work for him.
LOGAN Prison...
LOGAN Kayla finally raises her head-and looks directly at Logan.
KAYLA Shot my Daddy when I was eighteen.
KAYLA Big mistake.
KAYLA Should have shot him when I was seventeen.
LOGAN You told me he died of a heart attack.
KAYLA Maybe he had a heart attack after I shot him.
KAYLA Sat there and watched him bleed.
KAYLA After what that man did to me, I wish he died slower.
KAYLA Logan stares at her for a long time.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) That sweet little girl you lived with in the cabin?
KAYLA That was all make-believe.
LOGAN You loved me.
LOGAN I know you loved me.
LOGAN Kayla blinks and looks away.
KAYLA I'm a good actress.
LOGAN No one's that good.
STRYKER Everybody's a sucker for something.
STRYKER Figuring out what it is, that's the trick.
STRYKER For you, it's a woman's love.
STRYKER An easy weakness to forgive.
STRYKER But still a weakness.
STRYKER Stryker signals to Cornelius.
STRYKER The doctor and his assistant attach a nasty-looking copper halo to Logan's skull.
STRYKER The halo is wired to the electric chair.
STRYKER Logan never takes his eyes off Silverfox.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) Don't be angry at her.
STRYKER She was just serving her country, keeping the mutant menace in check.
STRYKER She and victor have been a real credit to their race.
STRYKER It takes Logan a moment to understand this comment.
LOGAN You're a mutant?
KAYLA My Daddy found out when I was twelve.
KAYLA Said a freak like me deserved whatever I got.
VICTOR CREED My kind of guy.
STRYKER She's a gifted girl.
STRYKER She can plant thoughts in anyone's mind, make them believe what she wants-- as long as she stays focused on them.
STRYKER He strokes her long dark hair, proud of his protege.
STRYKER Kayla doesn't seem thrilled by Stryker's touch, but she endures it.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd) A useful tool in a seduction.
KAYLA Spent so much time getting you to love me, by the time the Colonel showed up I couldn't get you to leave me.
KAYLA (r0N'rTN1 F.n 1
CONTINUED (2) Dr. Cornelius finishes calibrating his machine and adjusting the halo brace.
CORNELIUS We're good to go.
STRYKER So, Logan...
STRYKER The truth is, you're a real pain in the ass.
STRYKER But we've invested far too much time and treasure to terminate you.
STRYKER We're starting over.
STRYKER Cornelius checks the digital gauges on the machine.
CORNELIUS If I've calibrated correctly, we'll leave intact the hard-wired functions, walking and talking, all that good stuff.
VICTOR CREED You mean I don't get to potty train him?
CORNELIUS But every memory you've ever had will evaporate.
CORNELIUS Just like it never happened.
CORNELIUS Logan never takes his eyes off Kayla, his personal Judas.
LOGAN Good.
STRYKER Let me know when he's clean.
STRYKER I have to look in on our other guest.
STRYKER Stryker exits the room, followed by Victor.
LOGAN That story you told me...
LOGAN about the guy who goes to get flowers for the Moon.
LOGAN I can't get it out of my head.
LOGAN Except I had it all backwards.
LOGAN I thought you were the moon and I was your Wolverine.
LOGAN But you're the Trickster, aren't you?
CONTINUED (3) LOGAN (cont'd) And I'm just a schmuck who got played.
CONTINUED (3) Kayla is silent for a moment.
KAYLA My mother told me that story.
KAYLA She takes a deep breath and turns to go.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) It doesn't matter.
KAYLA You won't remember any of this.
LOGAN You didn't trick me into loving you.
KAYLA What?
LOGAN The last two months, you weren't playing around in my skull.
LOGAN You weren't using.
LOGAN your powers on me.
LOGAN I thought you were dead and I loved you more than ever.
LOGAN Maybe it makes you feel better to think it was all fake.
LOGAN But it was never fake for me.
LOGAN Kayla lowers her eyes.
KAYLA You don't know where I come from.
KAYLA You don't know what it was like.
LOGAN I know exactly what is was like.
LOGAN I come from there too.
KAYLA I didn't have a choice.
LOGAN Course you did.
LOGAN You still do.
LOGAN Kayla stares down at Logan.
LOGAN The tenderness returns to her face.
LOGAN She could free him right now if she wanted.
LOGAN The moment passes and Kayla shakes her head.
KAYLA I'm sorry.
KAYLA t C()NTTNTTPTI'
LOGAN Yeah, you keep saying that.
LOGAN Come on.
LOGAN Turn on the juice.
LOGAN Let's get this over with.
CORNELIUS Whenever you're ready, Miss Silverfox.
CORNELIUS Kayla turns and walks out of the room.
CORNELIUS Cornelius and his aide follow, shutting the door behind them.
CORNELIUS Logan takes a deep breath.
CORNELIUS He looks like a man who is ready to forget everything.
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY Hines sits alone on a metal cot.
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY The cell door slides open.
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY Stryker and Victor step inside.
STRYKER Lieutenant.
STRYKER Victor and I were just discussing how to kill you and we thought you might have some suggestions.
INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Silverfox steps out of the re-education chamber.
INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS She hears voices from the holding cell and approaches.
STRYKER When the Turks captured a traitor, they strapped a steel basket to the man's stomach.
STRYKER Inside the basket was a rat.
STRYKER Now, even a rat can't chew through steel.
STRYKER But it can chew through a stomach.
STRYKER So it would.
STRYKER Right through the skin and the fat and the muscle and the intestines, right on out the other side.
STRYKER l CDNTTNi7ET) I
Hines looks like she might be sick very soon.
Kayla steps into the doorway.
STRYKER (cont'd) Victor thinks the Turks were soft, letting the rats do the dirty work.
He's looking forward to spending your last night with you.
HINES Please, Colonel-- Stryker pats Hines on the cheek and nods to Victor.
STRYKER Enjoy yourself.
HINES Please don't do this...
HINES Please!
HINES Victor drags the screaming Hines off of her cot.
HINES Kayla watches with growing unease but Stryker smiles and- waves goodbye as he turns the key that shuts the cell door.
INT. RE-EDUCATION CENTER, ALKALI LAKE - DAY Logan sits in his electric chair, staring straight ahead, preparing himself for the pain.
INT. VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Cornelius stands behind the glass viewing window with his ASSISTANT.
INT. VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS He puts his hand on a red switch.
Thousands of volts surge into Logan's skull, forcing his body to arch.
After several seconds the power shuts off.
Tendrils of white smoke rise from the copper halo.
Logan opens his eyes and stares at Cornelius.
LOGAN That all you got?
CORNELIUS This could take a while.
CORNELIUS Raise the amperage by forty percent.
INT. STRYKER'S OFFICE - DAY Stryker signs a memo and hands it to his aide, Collins.
INT. STRYKER'S OFFICE - DAY Kayla stands by the window, picking at her fingers.
KAYLA You're going to let Victor kill that woman.
KAYLA Stryker and Collins ignore her.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) When you got me out of prison, you told me we were going to help people.
KAYLA Stryker continues to sign papers, never looking up.
STRYKER We are.
STRYKER We're saving humanity.
KAYLA From the mutants?
KAYLA The phone rings.
KAYLA Stryker answers it.
STRYKER Yes?
Good.
I'm coming down.
The Eleven is ready.
He stands and heads for the door.
Collins follows.
In the doorway, Stryker stops and fixes his cold blue gaze on Kayla.
STRYKER (cont'd) Don't worry, my sweet.
You're one of the good ones.
I'll protect you.
He and Collins exit the room, leaving Kayla alone with her misery.
INT. RE-EDUCATION CENTER, ALKALI LAKE - DAY Logan sits panting in the chair, gripping the ends of the arm rests with white fingers, waiting for the next surge of electricity.
INT. RE-EDUCATION CENTER, ALKALI LAKE - DAY It comes and he arches again, all the muscles in his body contracting, the veins in his neck bulging.
INT. VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Cornelius and his assistant watch Logan with no detectable sympathy.
INT. VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS They turn when Kayla walks into the room.
KAYLA Is he clean yet?
KAYLA Cornelius and the assistant face front again..
CORNELIUS He's stronger than I thought.
CORNELIUS We could be here all night..
CORNELIUS Kayla watches Logan in his agony.
CORNELIUS A glimmer of remorse passes over her face.
KAYLA He was good to me.
KAYLA Cornelius, fiddling with the amperage dial, curls his lips in a sardonic smile.
CORNELIUS You have a funny way of showing your gratitude.
CORNELIUS Logan thrashes in his chair.
CORNELIUS Kayla chews her lip.
CORNELIUS For a long count she watches Logan suffer.
KAYLA You should turn it off now.
KAYLA Cornelius turns and stares at her.
CORNELIUS I should what?
Oh.
I guess that's...
I guess that's a good idea.
He turns off the electricity.
1coNTTN IRD 1
KAYLA You two have always hated each other.
KAYLA You should fight.
KAYLA The assistant blinks and begins to scowl, turning toward Cornelius just in time to get punched in the mouth.
KAYLA The two men brawl on the floor with the lack of skill you'd expect from two scientists.
Kayla steps into the room.
Logan sits slumped motionless in the electric chair.
She detaches the copper halo.
The skin beneath the metal is singed but it quickly begins to heal.
Kayla stares at the man she betrayed, hesitates for a moment and exhales.
She unfastens the titanium manacles.
Logan is still unconscious.
Kayla shakes him gently.
KAYLA Hey.
KAYLA Wake up.
KAYLA Logan opens his eyes.
KAYLA He is clearly disoriented, as if waking from a long coma.
KAYLA He stares up at Kayla.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) Are you okay?
KAYLA Logan stares at her, groggy and confused.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you remember me?
In one blinding motion, Logan snatches Kayla by the throat and roughly pulls her to him.
She does not resist.
LOGAN I would have done anything for you.
KAYLA Please...
LOGAN Do you hear me?
LOGAN Anything.

INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY Victor Creed holds Hines against the cell wall with one hand.
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY Her feet kick in the air as she struggles.
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY He splits her blouse down the middle with a long black talon.
VICTOR CREED I've always had a thing for human chicks.
VICTOR CREED You're all so soft and helpless.
HINES No...
VICTOR CREED Maybe it's time I did a little surgery on you, Doctor.
LOGAN The woman said no.
LOGAN Creed turns his head and sees Logan and Kayla standing in the doorway.
LOGAN He grins and tosses Hines aside.
LOGAN She crashes into the wall and slides to the floor, dazed.
VICTOR CREED Starting to think you're addicted to pain.
VICTOR CREED You keep coming back for more.
VICTOR CREED Snikt !
LOGAN This is the end.
VICTOR CREED Amen to that.
VICTOR CREED Kayla stands in between them, holding up her hands.
KAYLA Please!
KAYLA We shouldn't be fighting each other.
KAYLA Stryker's using us.
VICTOR CREED A little late for the Mutant Power crap.
VICTOR CREED We hunt freaks for the man.
VICTOR CREED That's why we're free.
KAYLA What's he gonna do with us when the other mutants are dead?
KAYLA Put us in a zoo?
KAYLA Creed hesitates, considering the logic of her words.
KAYLA A fanged smile splits his face.
VICTOR CREED Don't try your head games on me.
VICTOR CREED I've gutted better telepaths than you.
VICTOR CREED Creed rears back to hammer Kayla, a blow that would separate her head from her body.
VICTOR CREED Logan catches Creed's fist inches from Kayla's face.
LOGAN Time you quit picking on girls.
VICTOR CREED Oh, I'm happy picking on men.
VICTOR CREED Creed swings at Logan's head, Logan ducks, and the fight begins.
VICTOR CREED This is melee so efficient that no motion is wasted.
VICTOR CREED Every lunge would kill any other adversary.
VICTOR CREED Every parried blow would shatter a normal man's arm.
VICTOR CREED Kayla, bleeding from the nose, staggers to her feet.
VICTOR CREED She helps up Hines and pushes her toward the door.
KAYLA Get out of here.
KAYLA Hines doesn't have to be told twice.
KAYLA She flees.
KAYLA Creed sees his plaything running out the door.
KAYLA He snarls in frustration.
VICTOR CREED You're ruining my party.
VICTOR CREED He grabs hold of Logan and hurls him headfirst through the cell wall-- a concrete support wall.
Logan crashes to the floor, covered in rubble.
Creed steps out of the cell, licking his fangs.
Creed tries to stomp Logan's face, but the smaller man rolls out of the way and gets back on his feet.
The mutants battle down the corridor, claws whistling through the air.
A team of SENTRIES charge around the corner, wearing tactical armor and carrying XM8 assault rifles.
They level their rifles at the battling mutants.
SENTRY #1 Get down!
SENTRY #1 Get down!
Down on your knees!
Logan and Creed, trying to punch holes in each other, ignore the sentries.
Kayla, staring down the barrels of the big guns,.
holds up her hands.
She concentrates, staring into the sentries' eyes.
KAYLA We're here as guests of Colonel Stryker.
KAYLA The sentries' hostility shifts into apologetic obeisance.
SENTRY #1 Very sorry about that.
KAYLA You boys are no longer needed here.
KAYLA Go back to barracks.
You got it.
See ya later.
Bye!
The sentries wave cheerfully and depart.
Creed and Logan are equally skilled, but Creed's superior size and strength begin to wear the smaller man down.
Creed slams him into the wall, opening fissures.
Holding both of Wolverine's wrists up with one hand, Creed grabs Wolverine's face with his free hand.
His black claws slide toward Wolverine's eyes.
VICTOR CREED How you gonna fight without eyes, little man?
VICTOR CREED Logan brings his knee up hard, smashing his adamantium- enhanced kneecap into Creed's groin.
VICTOR CREED The big man groans.
VICTOR CREED Logan spins Creed around, jamming him against the wall.
VICTOR CREED He tries to skewer Creed with the claws of his right hand but Creed moves his head at the last moment.
VICTOR CREED Logan's claws are buried to the hilt-in the wall.
VICTOR CREED He strikes at Creed with his left hand, but Creed dodges again.
VICTOR CREED All six of Logan's claws are deep in the solid rock wall.
VICTOR CREED He brings his hands.
VICTOR CREED together, the adamantium blades slicing through granite as if it were cheesecake.
VICTOR CREED Creed ducks under the claws an instant before they shred him.
VICTOR CREED He grabs Logan in a-bear hug.
VICTOR CREED A large section of the wall behind them falls out, and, unable to halt their momentum, Logan and Creed tumble through the hole, disappearing from sight.
VICTOR CREED Kayla runs over and stands at the jagged precipice, looking out onto the gargantuan Weapon XI cavern.
Logan and Creed fall seventy feet, clawing at each other in mid-air.
Logan hits the floor hard, the impact blasting a small crater in the concrete.
Creed manages a rolling fall, cat-quick and dexterous.
Stryker stands on the raised podium in the center of the cavern, overlooking his vast, sleeping army.
He cannot believe what he's seeing.
STRYKER I want the Eleven combat ready.
STRYKER (cnNTTNIIF.T)1
We can't rush them,.sir.
They've been in stasis for--
STRYKER I want them ready!
STRYKER The Lead Technician flinches and barks orders to his subordinates, who enter commands into their computers.
STRYKER The lids of ten thousand isolation tanks slide open.
STRYKER As the camera roams among the Eleven, needles and hoses detach from their bodies, releasing their metallic grip.
STRYKER The cloned Creeds begin to stir in their stainless steel coffins.
Creed pounces on Logan, who is still severely injured from the fall.
Creed tears into the smaller man mercilessly, slinging him around the cavern, gouging him with his black talons.
Creed batters Logan with a series of savage blows.
Logan falls, his healing factor overwhelmed, barely conscious.
Creed plants one heavy black boot on Logan's face and presses down hard.
He leers at his defeated foe.
VICTOR CREED Your pal Wraith pissed all over my boots when I crushed his spine.
VICTOR CREED Smell like fear, don't they?
VICTOR CREED Something changes within Logan, a fury so overwhelming it cannot be contained, a rage so vast it could only be called berserker.
VICTOR CREED .Logan rolls toward his tormentor, sweeping his claws straight through Creed's ankle, severing the foot.
VICTOR CREED Creed screams and falls to his knees.
VICTOR CREED Logan stands, grabbing a handful of Creed's dirty blonde hair.
LOGAN This is for the ones who couldn't fight back.
CONTINUED (2) The adamantium blades are a silver blur in the overhead light.
Stryker, standing on the podium, sees his chief henchman's head tumble from his shoulders.
He grits his teeth and surveys his army.
Ten thousand enhanced warriors begin to step out of their steel coffins, baring their fangs, eyeing their surroundings.
STRYKER Activate the PA system.
STRYKER The Lead Technicians flips a switch.
STRYKER Stryker speaks into a microphone; his voice booms from speakers mounted on the pillars throughout the cavern.
STRYKER STRYKER (c.ont'd) Soldiers!
STRYKER The Eleven snap to attention with machined synchronicity, all ten thousand facing Stryker.
Logan, bloodied but healing, stares down at his fallen enemy.
KAYLA Logan!
KAYLA Kayla runs down one of the steel staircases that clings to the cavern wall like fire escapes.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) If we get closer to Stryker, I can work my magic.
KAYLA Logan stares at Stryker, his true enemy, the.man who destroyed his life.
KAYLA Ten thousand clones.
KAYLA encircle Stryker, who stands on the raised podium in the cavern's center.
LOGAN I don't want him hypnotized.
LOGAN I want him dead.
LOGAN Never taking his eyes off his enemy, Logan advances.
I c_0NTTNTTF:T)1.
CONTINUED (3) Stryker sees Logan walking toward him, toward the hordes of clones.
CONTINUED (3) Stryker shakes his head and smiles.
STRYKER The man's committing suicide.
STRYKER He leans into the microphone.
STRYKER The Eleven listen to their commander's voice, amplified by hundreds of speakers STRYKER (cont'd) No army that ever marched could stand against you!
STRYKER You will never abandon your mission, and your mission is simple!
STRYKER Kill the mutants!
STRYKER Kill them wherever you find them!
STRYKER Stryker points at Logan.
STRYKER STRYKER (cont'd)
Ten thousand cloned murderers turn on Logan, soulless black eyes focusing on their target.
Logan stops his march beside one of the massive steel pillars.
that supports the cavern ceiling.
LOGAN Get the hell out of here.
KAYLA What are you doing?
LOGAN Bringin' down the house.
LOGAN He sweeps his claws clean through the pillar, at an angle.
LOGAN The uppermost section shears off and drills into the floor with a concussive whump that spiderwebs the concrete for thirty feet around the impact site.
LOGAN Stryker realizes what Logan is doing.
The Eleven charge.
From above we can see the full-scale of the onslaught, wave upon wave of cloned murderers closing in.
(CENTTN11FTl'
CONTINUED (4) Logan runs to the next pillar and slices through it.
CONTINUED (4) Creaks and groans sound overhead, as the tremendous weight above exerts pressure on the remaining weight-bearing supports.
CONTINUED (4) Most of the ten thousand can't get close to Logan, but they all want in on the first kill.
CONTINUED (4) Whirling, slashing, stabbing, kicking, Logan scythes a circle of devastation, spray-painting the floor with the black blood of the Eleven.
CONTINUED (4) He reaches a third pillar and chops through it.
CONTINUED (4) Kayla eyes the ceiling nervously and hurries toward the exit.
CONTINUED (4) STRYKER (cont'd)
Even Logan can't hold back the tide for long.
Talons rake his face, his arms, his chest.
But still he battles, slicing through a fourth pillar, a fifth.
Tremendous fissures split the rock ceiling.
Dust and rocks fall onto the cavern floor as the fissures widen.
Logan sees that the cavern's collapse is imminent.
He can no longer hold off the Eleven's assault.
An instant before the clones can shred him, he jumps, using his claws to scale one of the still-standing steel pillars with the grace and speed of a leopard climbing a tree.
One of the clones follows, using his black talons in the same fashion, grabbing at Logan's feet.
When Logan is forty feet above the throng of teeth-gnashing clones, he severs the pillar below his feet.
The clone chasing him can climb no farther, can do nothing but roar and hiss at his escaping prey.
Logan swings himself onto the steel staircase, where Kayla waits beside the open door.
He races up the stairs.
Stryker sees his dream in ruins.
He runs for the nearest exit.
Kayla and Logan are a few feet from the door, from safety, when the cavern ceiling gives out.
Thousands of tons of stone and steel come crashing down.
Logan grabs Kayla and hauls her to safety an instant before she would be crushed.
EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY The compound has essentially imploded, the major structures falling into the massive pit created by the cavern's collapse.
EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY Severed gas lines and ruptured boilers have turned the crater into a raging fire pit.
EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY Smoke billows up from the molten core.
EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY A few dazed survivors, SOLDIERS and SCIENTISTS, have escaped the carnage, but Alkali Lake no longer exists as a military base.
EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY Thousands of singed documents flutter in the wind.
EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY Logan and Kayla walk away from the burning crater, never looking back.
EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY They head through the woods toward the lake that glitters in the sunlight.
KAYLA One of them could have survived.
KAYLA Logan glances at her.
KAYLA KAYLA (cont'd) The clones.
KAYLA They've got your healing factor.
KAYLA Logan looks back at the devastation.
LOGAN Unless someone comes along who can move a few million tons of steel, they ain't going anywhere.
They stop at the edge of the lake.
Paper from the destroyed base drifts through the air, falling on the water and the shore.
LOGAN Almost looks peaceful from here.
KAYLA There's something I want you to know.
KAYLA He looks at her.
KAYLA (CONTTNt1F.fl
KAYLA (cont'd) Maybe nothing I say matters anymore.
But I'm going to say it anyway.
I...
A blossom of blood opens up on her chest.
She stares down at it in wonder before sinking to her knees.
Logan turns and sees Stryker walking toward them.
KAYLA (cont'd) No...
Stryker fires again.
The adamantium bullet rips through Logan's forehead with an unholy sound.
Logan falls to the ground.
Stryker stands above him and fires another bullet into Logan's head.
Stryker turns the gun on Kayla.
KAYLA (cont'd) You don't need to waste another bullet.
I'm already dead.
Stryker blinks and hesitates.
Kayla coughs, her strength beginning to fade.
KAYLA (cont'd) Maybe you should turn that gun on yourself, Colonel.
Stryker nods, pointing the gun at his own head.
KAYLA (cont'd) It would be good for the mutants if I made you pull the trigger..
Why do you hate us so much?
Stryker's finger trembles on the trigger.
KAYLA (cont'd) Is it because your son is one of us?
For the first time, perhaps, we see something human in the cold blue of Stryker's eyes.
KAYLA (cont'd) Enough killing, Colonel.
Throw your gun in the lake.

CONTINUED (2) Stryker does as he's told.
CONTINUED (2) The revolver sinks into the water.
CONTINUED (2) KAYLA (cont'd) Leave us.
CONTINUED (2) Keep walking till your feet start to bleed.
CONTINUED (2) Stryker turns and walks away.
CONTINUED (2) Kayla crawls over to Logan.
CONTINUED (2) She lifts his head onto her lap.
CONTINUED (2) He's unconscious but breathing.
CONTINUED (2) The bullet holes in his skin have already healed.
CONTINUED (2) She strokes his jaw.
CONTINUED (2) and smiles sadly.
CONTINUED (2) One of the scraps of paper from the base blows against her leg.
CONTINUED (2) She takes it and looks down at the blank page.
CONTINUED (2) She has no pen.
CONTINUED (2) She touches her chest, just above her heart, wetting her finger with her blood.
CONTINUED (2) She writes four words on the page, blows on it to dry it, folds it once and places it in Logan's hand.
CONTINUED (2) She kisses his lips and rests his head gently on the ground.
CONTINUED (2) Fighting the pain, a dying woman, Kayla manages to stand.
CONTINUED (2) KAYLA (cont'd) If you ever remember what I did to you, try to forgive me.
CONTINUED (2) I was a fool.
CONTINUED (2) And you were right...
CONTINUED (2) I always loved you.
CONTINUED (2) She turns and walks toward the lake, never looking back, never hesitating as the waters rise above her knees, above her waist, above her shoulders, above her head.
Logan's eyes flutter and open.
For a moment he squints into the blue sky.
He sits up, looking around.
The woods are empty.
He stands, completely disoriented, a stranger in the world.
He realizes that he's holding a piece of paper in his hand.
He unfolds it and reads the message written in blood.
You are my Wolverine.
He stares at it for a moment before folding it carefully and putting it in his pocket.
f C ONTTNIIRD)
He takes a deep breath of cold air and walks west, toward the falling sun.
He doesn't know who he is.
He doesn't know where he's going.
But the wind blows through his hair, the last of the sunlight feels good on his skin.
He is a free man.
He walks toward his destiny..
