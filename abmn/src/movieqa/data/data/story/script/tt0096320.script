The CAMERA is MOVING SLOWLY DOWN a long basement corridor.
We hear a narrator (Werner) --
WERNER (V.O.) On his 35th birthday, I decided to tell Julius Benedict the truth about himself...
HOLD ON sign: "Top Secret - Authorized Personnel Only."
WERNER (V.O.) It wasn't that he was the product of a scientific experiment.
A white coated scientist (PROFESSOR WERNER) is studying a bizarre piece of equipment that looks suspiciously like a milkshake blender.
With him is another scientist -- (this is TRAVEN -- already imperious, already a prick).
WERNER (V.O.) An experiment designed to produce a physically, mentally and spiritually superior human being.
WERNER (V.O.) I explained that to him when he was two years old.
Most of them young, 20s and 30s.
They are being given a medical examination by a group of doctors, including Werner.
WERNER (V.O.) And it wasn't the complexity of Julius's parentage.
WERNER (V.O.) He knew that unlike other little boys, he didn't have just one, but half a dozen fathers, all very distinguished men.
TWINS - Rev.
4/22/88 2.
Not your Hollywood type.
This is obviously a lady of character and talent.
Her name we will come to learn is MARY ANN BENEDICT.
She is on a hospital bed and being readied for surgery.
WERNER (V.O.) Nor was it about the extraordinary woman chosen to be his mother...
Traven emerges, sadly shaking his head.
Werner tries to enter the room -- Traven won't permit it.
WERNER (V.O.) Julius had long lived with the tragic news that she died giving birth to him.
As a nurse, parting the security guards, emerges and holds up a plump, serene, smiling baby boy.
WERNER (V.O.) What Julius didn't know, until this very moment, was that, about a minute after he was born...
Another nurse emerges from the delivery room, holding up a second INFANT -- this one is SCREAMING with rage.
WERNER (V.O.) His mother gave birth to another baby...
The serene baby.
Any mother's joy.
The angry baby.
Fuming.
PULL BACK to reveal: The two of them are in the same crib.
The leg of the angry baby.
It suddenly lashes out, connects with the rump of the serene baby: The serene BABY.
Starting to CRY.
The angry baby.
All smiles now.
HOLD ON the two babies in their crib as the following words fill the screen:
He looks up and stares dead AT the CAMERA --
JULIUS I have a brother?!!!
A greenhouse on the island.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 5/9/88 4.
Werner, now 70, is bent and old.
Julius, in peasant garb is a marvelous-looking human being.
WERNER He was sent to an orphanage in Los Angeles.
WERNER At the same time I brought you here to the island.
WERNER Julius isn't listening.
WERNER His eyes shine.
JULIUS I have a twin brother?!!
JULIUS What's his name?
WERNER Vincent.
JULIUS Vincent -- Every time I loved something I called it Vincent -- I called my first computer Vincent!
JULIUS I have to find him!
Julius strides along a windswept path, followed by Werner.
The ocean spread out below them is vast and empty.
This island is far from anywhere.
WERNER You've been here since you were a baby -- you know nothing of America --
JULIUS I know it is the cradle of democracy and the land of the free; besides, I speak twelve languages -- I'm sure I can get a job.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 5/9/88 5.
WERNER They're a simple people; rather primitive, not like us.
JULIUS My brother will look after me.
It's a blend of modern technology and the tropical environment -- floor-to-ceiling book-cases, computers, a hammock shrouded in a mosquito net.
Julius is hurriedly packing a small leather suitcase, watched by Werner.
Werner hands over a photograph: it's a picture of a younger Werner, Traven, and the six fathers.
JULIUS It's your only copy --
WERNER -- My need for it is only sentimental -- yours may be practical -- Julius slips the photo into his suitcase.
JULIUS Thank you -- I'll miss you.
WERNER I'll miss you.
WERNER They hug as we --
The water's edge.
Julius, Werner, an OLDER LADY, two scientists and an ORIENTAL man are all saying goodbye.
Julius puts his suitcase into a small rowboat.
WERNER TWINS - Rev.
WERNER 5/9/88 6.
* OLD WOMAN * (as Julius hugs her) * It's sixty miles to the airport, * Julius; be careful.
* OLD WOMAN * * Julius then bows to the Oriental, who bows back.
JULIUS It was an honor to study under you, Master.
JULIUS Without warning, the Oriental tries to strike Julius in the face with the side of his hand, but Julius blocks the blow.
ORIENTAL Ahhh, always on guard.
ORIENTAL You have learned well, Julius-san.
ORIENTAL Julius gives a last hug to Werner.
JULIUS I was just thinking, maybe my brother Vincent is married.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 5/25/88 A6A.
WERNER And...?
JULIUS Well, if a woman loved my brother enough to marry him, she might have a sister who'd feel the same way about me.
JULIUS That often happens with twins, you know.
WERNER Julius -- please -- don't get your hopes up.
WERNER Your brother doesn't even know you exist.
WERNER Julius gets in the boat and casts off.
WERNER The boat takes off like a streak.
WERNER Julius, in perfect rhythm, increases the pace.
WERNER The boat is almost flying across the water.
JULIUS Of course he does.
JULIUS I've always known there was something missing in my life!
JULIUS And deep down, I'm sure Vincent feels the same way!
JULIUS He's probably just like meeeee!
VINCE BENEDICT lies in bed, looking extremely pleased with himself.
A SEXY YOUNG WOMAN is nestled asleep against him.
The digital bedside ALARM PURRS and starts to PLAY MUSIC -- something romantic that Vince hums along to.
VINCE You sleep well, honey?
CARLA (SEXY YOUNG WOMAN) Mmmm...
CARLA (SEXY YOUNG WOMAN) like a baby.
VINCE Me, too.
VINCE I love this new mattress.
VINCE It's soft but it's hard at the same time.
VINCE And I love this new clock.
VINCE Carla snuggles against Vince as he surveys the bedroom like a house-proud new owner.
TWINS - Rev.
5/25/88 B6A.
VINCE You've done a great job on this room, Carla.
CARLA You really think so?
CARLA Even the curtains?
VINCE The curtains are the key to the whole thing.
VINCE They're colorful...
VINCE they're brilliant...
VINCE they're...
VINCE great curtains.
CARLA You were great last night, Vince.
VINCE Naaaw...
VINCE I think we're going to be very happy here.
Suddenly we hear a DOOR downstairs as it OPENS, and a man's voice drifts up the stairs:
TWINS - Rev.
4/15/88 6A.
MAN Honey!
MAN I'm home!
VINCE What's he doing back so early?
Vince jumps out of bed, starts pulling on his clothes while Carla slips into a bathrobe.
MAN Carla?
MAN You gonna cook me some breakfast or what?
CARLA Be right down, sweetheart!
Vince checks his appearance in a dresser mirror, straightens his Armani suit, brushes his hair, pulls it into a fashionable ponytail.
He cuts a stylish figure.
Noticing an expensive gold lighter on the dresser top, he covertly pockets it.
Carla pushes him towards the open French doors.
CARLA Hurry up!
CARLA I gotta make breakfast!
VINCE You're wonderful, Carla.
VINCE Your husband doesn't deserve to kiss your feet.
Vince steps out and jauntily climbs over the rail.
It's very clear he likes the danger, being on the edge.
In another life, he was probably Errol Flynn.
Now, he gives Carla an Errol Flynn smile -- -- and with that, he leaps into space!
As Vince gracefully lands, bounces off it onto the ground.
He bends, picks up a flower, puts it in the outside pocket of his Armani suit, heads toward a new Mustang * parked not far away.
As Vince gets in, starting to sing.
VINCE 'Oh what a beautiful morning, Oh what a beautiful day'...
Now he does something surprising -- not starting to drive, we expect that.
What we don't expect is his destination -- because what he does is simply turn the nearest corner and drive right back to the house he just snuck out of.
VINCE ...
VINCE 'everything's going my way'...
18   INT. AL'S HOUSE - DAY                                     18   * where Carla, in her robe, is working away starting to make breakfast.
Vince enters, gives her the sweetest smile.
VINCE Carla, what a joy to look at you.
TWINS - Rev.
5/9/88 8.
VINCE (CONT'D) Is my partner and best friend, Al home from work yet?
VINCE (CONT'D) I am the bringer of good tidings.
The kitchen door opens and AL GRECO enters.
He is sing- ing "Happy Birthday" and carries a wrapped gift held out in front of him.
He's dressed in overalls with an insignia on his breast pocket that reads "AIRPORT
VINCE Stop with that horrible song, you know how I hate birthdays; they're worse than Christmas.
Al presents him with the gift.
VINCE For me?
AL Carla and I figured, since you were always admiring mine, what the hell...
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 9.
Vince struggles to contain his delight at this irony.
VINCE A lighter, just like yours.
VINCE I don't know what to say, Al.
VINCE I'm all choked up.
The PHONE RINGS and Carla picks it up.
CARLA Hello -- the Greco residence...
CARLA sure.
CARLA Who may I say is calling...
CARLA Mr. Burt Klane?
CARLA Vince, it's for you --
Vince confidently picks up the receiver.
VINCE Good morning, Mr. Klane.
VINCE I hope you're having a wonderful --
VINCE Yes -- no problem -- I have it.
VINCE Yes.
VINCE Today.
VINCE Of course.
VINCE 'Bye.
Vince hangs up.
AL What are you doing talking to a loanshark?
VINCE That's part of my good news -- You know that money I picked up from the Jaguar we boosted.
VINCE Well, * I put the money in the stock * market.
VINCE I got this incredible * tip.
CARLA Oh no.
VINCE I can't lose.
VINCE Ever hear of P.V.T. * Industries?
VINCE Probably not -- * Secret takeover bid --
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 10.
AL You put the money on a stock?
VINCE A very special stock -- and it was such a sure thing -- I borrowed another 20 grand from the Klane * Brothers.
CARLA You borrowed from a loan shark to invest in the stock market?
VINCE On margin -- And as of last night I was ten thousand ahead.
VINCE I'm * going to make a fortune -- turn on the T.V.
Cable news -- stock report.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) ...
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) that Wall Street's suffering its worst single-day's losses since October '87.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) Hardest hit * were Federated Broadcasting, down $18, Waverton Data, down $24 and P.V.T.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) Industries, down $32.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) Analysts speculate that even blue chip stocks will not remain immune to...
CLOSEUP ON the extremely worried face of Vince as he takes in the bad news.
AL You are having one shitty birthday, Vince.
AL TWINS - Rev.
AL 4/27/88 11.
VINCE I'm wiped out.
VINCE I got to get some money -- fast.
AL Well...
AL '88 B.M.W. came in for long term last night...
CARLA Don't you think you're doing this too often?
VINCE I'm a desperate man.
AL Level three.
AL Stall 25.
22     OMITTED                                                       22 thru thru
CLOSEUP ON a large painted number 25 then PAN DOWN to reveal a new BMW.
Vincent approaches the BMW and pretends to be searching for his keys while he waits for another car to pull out and drive away.
The second it's gone, Vince deftly opens the BMW door with a "slim-Jim."
He gets behind the wheel, hot wires the ignition and drives away.
Vince is a pro.
The green BMW is already being repainted by some Men wearing goggles and using spray guns.
Vince comes out of an office, counting a wad of bills, followed by the OWNER of the chop shop.
AL TWINS - Rev.
AL 4/15/88 12/13.
VINCE This is only four thousand --
OWNER We're in a recession -- Everything's tough -- you want to try someone else -- no hard feelings.
VINCE Forget it.
OWNER You okay, Vince?
OWNER You seem a little worried.
VINCE Me?
VINCE I laugh myself to sleep every night, and I never sleep alone.
VINCE I'm doing great!
VINCE The Owner smiles and turns.
VINCE Vince continues counting the money, nervous as hell.
VINCE Now --
TWINS - Rev.
4/22/88 14.
Flying through clear, blue skies.
Coming down the aisle, checking the passengers, as we hear:
JULIUS (V.O.) 'Put on your red dress, baby 'Cause we're going out tonight...'
A few passengers turn and look back at --
JULIUS seated in the rear, still in his peasant garb, the bamboo suitcase resting on his lap.
He has his headphones on and is singing along to the music, his eyes closed and his head bobbing.
JULIUS 'I better wear some boxing gloves, In case some fool might want to fight.'
The STEWARDESS removes his headphones and considers Julius with amusement.
STEWARDESS I knew you were trouble the second I laid eyes on you.
Julius stares up at her, speechless and mesmerized.
JULIUS Sorry -- I've never heard this music before -- I love it.
She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while Julius gazes down at her ample cleavage.
STEWARDESS The captain wants us to buckle our seat belts because we're expecting a little turbulence.
JULIUS Thank you, Betty Lou.
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 15.
STEWARDESS I bet you're a football player.
JULIUS Actually, I'm a horticultural botanist, a mathematician, and a philosopher.
STEWARDESS Right.
STEWARDESS And I'm a brain surgeon.
As the Stewardess heads back up the aisle, a MAN jumps up, grabs her around the neck with one arm and brandishes a gun in his other hand.
HIJACKER (MAN) Nobody moves, or else we're gonna have a serious draft in here.
HIJACKER (MAN) Get the captain.
HIJACKER (MAN) I want to discuss our final destination.
He continues maneuvering the Stewardess up the aisle.
His back is totally to Julius now.
JULIUS turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him who's clutching a hardcover Bible in her lap.
JULIUS Excuse me, ma'am.
As he takes the book from her, quickly draws back his arm --
The gun at the panicked Stewardess's head, he continues slowly up the aisle, shouting for everyone to freeze, not even to think about moving -- -- now a hardcover book comes rocketing through the air, hits him in the back of the neck and he goes limp, fall- ing across some seats, the gun dropping from his hand.
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 16.
BUNCH OF PASSENGERS grabbing him, all of them brave and heroic -- a lot of commotion -- shouts of "I've got him," "Don't move," etc.
HAND retrieving the hardcover Bible from the floor and --
OLD WOMAN as Julius smiles reassuringly, returns her Bible to her, sits back in his seat.
JULIUS His mischief shall return upon his own hand, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own head -- Psalm 7:16.
In front now, there is a lot of activity as various pass- engers hold the Highjacker, almost arguing over who's in control.
Julius looks at them a moment, puts on his headset, closes his eyes and is soon bopping away to the music.
As the plane circles to land.
Julius exits the terminal surrounded by Orientals.
He makes his way to an airport shuttle bus.
TWINS - Rev.
5/2/88 17.
As Vince sidles into a booth, watched by a BARTENDER who clearly dislikes him.
BARTENDER It's him.
BARTENDER He's back.
A pretty young cocktail waitress called MARNIE turns and stares daggers at Vince.
Marnie is a fireball of a girl, all brass and sass on the outside and sweet as cotton candy on the inside, sort of a Jean Harlow valley girl.
She approaches Vince, who greets her with effusive warmth.
VINCE Marnie!
VINCE How are you?
VINCE Is your * sister around?
Marnie pointedly scoops up the tip left by the previous occupants of the booth.
Marnie starts to wipe down the table, spilling crumbs into his lap.
MARNIE You total Linda's car.
MARNIE You pawn * her stereo.
MARNIE You declare us as * dependents on your tax return!?
VINCE What an amazing memory --
FEMALE Vince!
FEMALE I knew you'd come back!
Marnie's sister, LINDA, also a cocktail waitress, slips into the booth and gives Vince a big kiss.
Linda, although just as attractive as her younger sister, has a completely different personality: she's trusting, dependent, and legally blind when it comes to Vincent.
VINCE I am so sorry for all the miserable things I've done to you.
LINDA Like what?
MARNIE Linda!
TWINS - Rev.
5/2/88 18.
LINDA I'm not going to give him any money.
LINDA Just take care of my station for a minute.
Marnie exchanges an exasperated glance with the Bartender and walks away.
Linda distances herself a little from Vince in the booth, not meeting his eyes.
VINCE I didn't come here for a loan, sweetheart.
VINCE I came to say goodbye.
VINCE (beat) * It's not safe for me here.
VINCE People are trying to kill me.
Vince starts to rise but Linda pulls him back down.
LINDA What did you do, Vince?
VINCE I got involved in the stock market.
LINDA I promised Marnie I wouldn't give you money.
Vince takes Linda's hand between his and stares into her eyes.
LINDA Don't look at me like that...
LINDA Don't do that with your eyes...
LINDA I shouldn't even be here with you.
VINCE You are here and so am I, Maybe millions of people go by, But they all disappear from view, And I only have eyes for you...
VINCE Linda.
VINCE I only have eyes for you.
LINDA That is so beautiful.
LINDA How do you make up that stuff?
LINDA You're such a poet.
TWINS - Rev.
5/2/88 19.
VINCE You inspire me.
A man enters.
He starts looking around, checking the booths.
He looks like a professional enforcer, which in fact, he is.
He is also the smallest of the Klane brothers: BURT KLANE.
Vince ducks down under the table.
VINCE It's the baby Klane -- I gotta get the hell out.
Burt Klane strolls to the middle of the room, then suddenly turns and faces Linda.
BURT KLANE Where's the little shit?
LINDA You gotta be more specific, considering our clientele.
BURT KLANE Benedict.
LINDA He wouldn't show his face around here.
LINDA Right, Marnie?
She looks down at --
He silently starts to crawl away in the direction of the back door.
MARNIE Who, Vincent?
MARNIE TWINS - Rev.
MARNIE 5/2/88 20.
MARNIE (CONT'D) -- That weasel, that creep -- that oily little slug -- that two-bit, two-timing, waste of space -- that pathetic, low-life pocket Romeo.
BURT KLANE Okay -- enough.
The back door opens and Vince crawls out on hands and knees.
His journey abruptly ends as he now faces KLANE #2 -- BOB -- considerably larger than his brother inside.
Vince is thrown in, forcefully, into a table.
He crashes onto the floor.
BOB KLANE Look what I found crawling around out back.
A booth at the back of the restaurant: Vince is seated with the two Klane brothers.
He hands over the money he picked up from the BMW -- $4000.
The smaller Klane counts it quickly.
BURT KLANE This is only four thousand --
VINCE The rest is invested.
VINCE We're gonna make a fortune.
VINCE Bob suddenly punches Vince in the side knocking the breath out of him.
BOB KLANE Shut up.
BOB KLANE TWINS - Rev.
BOB KLANE 5/2/88 21/22.
Linda comes over -- Very nervous, she looks around, then hands over an envelope.
LINDA I hope this helps -- Please don't hurt him.
BURT KLANE There you go -- (he counts Linda's money) -- Another thousand -- Okay -- This nice lady just bought you a day Vince -- I want it all -- Twenty- thousand -- this time tomorrow.
VINCE Twenty -- ?
VINCE But I just paid -- Just as he opens his mouth, Vince is elbowed again.
BURT KLANE That's just the interest.
BURT KLANE The * twenty's the principal.
Linda is walking Vince out.
VINCE That was the most wonderful birthday present anybody ever gave me --
LINDA It's your birthday?
LINDA Why didn't you tell me?
VINCE I can't take the kindness.
VINCE It gives me the shakes.
LINDA You'll tremble plenty before we're through, Vince Benedict.
LINDA They kiss.
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 23.
Vince brushes himself off, hesitates a moment, pulling on his left ear with his right hand.
Immediately behind him, facing the opposite direction, is another man, also pulling on his left ear with his right hand.
It is Julius --
-- Their backs are to each other.
Without ever catching sight of one another, they move off, going their separate ways.
Now, from this --
Downtown Hollywood in all it's sleeze.
There's a wax museum and a scientology center and every fast food place imaginable and people shouting as they sell things, "flowers" and street food and there's a porno house * showing Tight 'n Tender and there's young people dressed like punks and old people boozed out and pimps and druggies and guys slumped unconscious in the gutter and crowds of tourists walking this way, that way, and there's noise and litter and one more thing -- -- There's Julius, case in hand, staring around, taking it all in.
We're a long way from his island now.
He studies all the humanity swirling around him --
CLOSEUP ON JULIUS And you can see it on his face: He loves it.
JULIUS ...
JULIUS How wonderful...

Julius, eating a hot dog, is walking along a street in Hollwyood.
In his island peasant garb, he doesn't look all that unusual considering his surroundings.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 5/2/88 24.
But Julius is pretty noticable no matter where he goes.
TWO HELMETLESS MOTORCYCLISTS watching Julius.
TWO HELMETLESS MOTORCYCLISTS More specifically, they are watching the expensive-looking leather-edged suitcase he carries in his hand.
TWO HELMETLESS MOTORCYCLISTS They look at the case a moment more, then Biker #2 gets his MACHINE PURRING softly.
You never saw such lingerie.
PULL BACK to reveal: Julius, staring at it, shaking his head.
JULIUS What an amazing country.
BIKER #1 ROARING up beside Julius, smiling ingratiatingly.
BIKER #1 Got a light, pal?
JULIUS Sorry, but I don't smoke...
JULIUS pal?
JULIUS Julius thinks he's found a friend.
BIKER #1 Looking for something for your girl friend?
JULIUS I...
JULIUS don't have a girl friend.
JULIUS Do women really wear these things?
BIKER #1 If you're lucky.
BIKER #1 You from out of town?
BIKER #1 TWINS - Rev.
BIKER #1 5/2/88 25.
JULIUS Yes, a small island in the South * Pacific, about 300 nautical miles south-southwest of Fiji...
JULIUS Biker #2, bounds along, and when he reaches Julius he grabs the handle of the leather case that Julius holds, his plan quite obvious -- to steal the case and disappear into the crowded street.
JULIUS Not an original plan, certainly, but one that over and over again, always works --
CASE HANDLE Julius's hand holds fast to it.
CASE HANDLE Then --
BIKER #2 As his mouth drops open as we --
JULIUS just sort of standing there, no big deal, not much effort showing on his face as Biker #2 begins to slowly rise into the air as he and his cycle are about to be parted and then --
CYCLIST #2 still holding to the case as his CYCLE ZOOMS away from him and for a moment he is flat in mid-air, parallel to the cement sidewalk and --
RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE ROARING into the crowd and people shriek, dive out of its way and --
CYCLIST #2 falling to the pavement, his head colliding hard and he's out and --
RIDERLESS CYCLE ending its trip as it collides with a storefront and collapses on its side, MOTOR still ROARING but no movement anymore and --
CYCLIST #1 stunned, going to his unconscious partner.
BIKER #1 What the hell did you do?
BIKER #1 Julius calmly kneels beside the still form.
BIKER #1 He puts his case down, and his hands move expertly across the prone figure.
JULIUS I did nothing, the pavement was his enemy.
JULIUS eyes almost closed as his skilled hands touch the guy a moment more.
JULIUS I would say -- a concussion -- a mild shoulder separation, and ribs
four to seven are cracked.
Julius rises.
JULIUS Get him to a hospital.
JULIUS And now he picks up his case, starts to go; pauses.
JULIUS And in the future, you should both consider wearing helmets.
JULIUS A sweet smile.

Vince, approaching his car, sees a motorcycle COP putting a ticket under his windshield wiper.
Vince marches over, examines the ticket.
VINCE Fifty-three dollars?
VINCE You gotta * be kidding.
COP Your vehicle's in a handicapped zone.
COP Vince immediately hunches his shoulder and affects a limp.
VINCE So?
VINCE Do I look normal to you?
COP You don't have a 'handicapped' sticker on your windshield.
COP Driver's license, please.
CLOSEUP - VINCE'S HAND It is being handcuffed to his car's door handle.
COP You've got over 200 outstanding parking tickets, Mr. Benedict.
COP And you just had your birthday?
COP Well, your driver's license just expired -- Happy birthday.
COP TWINS - Rev.
COP 4/27/88 28.
As we HOLD ON Vince's depressed face we FADE TO BLACK --
Julius walks up the stairs leading to the front door.
Young boys in uniform are raucously enjoying their recess under the supervision of several nuns in habits.
JULIUS (V.O.) So, this is where my brother grew up.
JULIUS (V.O.) I'm glad he had so many friends to play with.
An elderly MOTHER SUPERIOR looks dubiously at Julius as he stares out the window down on the playground.
He turns and examines the dormitory which is lined with metal cots.
He points to a cot near the door and smiles fondly.
JULIUS And that's where he must have slept.
MOTHER SUPERIOR How did you know?
JULIUS It's the one I would have chosen.
JULIUS It's next to the fire extinguisher.
JULIUS In case of a fire, I could have given the alarm, and saved the other orphans.
MOTHER SUPERIOR We've only had one fire at St.
MOTHER SUPERIOR Charlotte's.
MOTHER SUPERIOR Vince Benedict started it, we like to think by accident.
TWINS - Rev.
4/15/88 28A.
The Mother Superior opens a file cabinet and begins rummaging through it, watched by Julius.
JULIUS Tell me about him.
JULIUS Was he a good athlete?
JULIUS Did he like chess and poetry?
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 29.
MOTHER SUPERIOR I'm certain that God had a purpose when he created Vincent Benedict, but it had nothing to do with chess or poetry.
She locates a file, removes it; the only thing inside it is a photograph, which falls to her desk.
MOTHER SUPERIOR That's odd...
MOTHER SUPERIOR the contents of his file are missing.
Julius picks up the photo -- a 13-year-old boy leering up at an attractive young nun.
JULIUS This is him?
JULIUS He looks happy -- *
MOTHER SUPERIOR He should -- that's Sister Maria, * his biology teacher.
JULIUS I always liked biology.
MOTHER SUPERIOR So did Vincent.
MOTHER SUPERIOR He disgraced Sister Maria, who had to leave the order.
MOTHER SUPERIOR Then he stole all the money from our library fund and ran away.
The Mother Superior is trying, tactfully, to close the door on Julius.
JULIUS But I have to find him.
JULIUS Where do you think he might be?
MOTHER SUPERIOR Jail.
MOTHER SUPERIOR A man of his character could only be in jail.
MOTHER SUPERIOR You're full of goodness, Julius -- I pray that you never find him.
Sweet smile as the door is closed and we --
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 30.
A bunch of people are in the cell along with Vince.
Most noticable is an amazingly tall, slender, muscular black man.
We're talking a SEVEN FOOTER here.
A bad tempered Seven Footer.
SEVEN FOOTER What're you lookin' at?
VINCE At you, you jerk.
The Seven Footer rises angrily to his full size.
Vince moves right in on him -- he may be going through a bad patch, but make no mistake, Vince is tough.
VINCE Tyrone Davis, averaged 23 points, eleven rebounds and four blocks a game his senior year.
VINCE First round pick of the L.A. Clippers and now look at him.
SEVEN FOOTER Who're you?
VINCE World International Athletics * Representation.
VINCE Vincent Benedict -- President.
VINCE I coulda got you a no-cut contract so you wouldn't have to heist T.V. sets for a living --
GUARD coming to the cell door.
GUARD Benedict!
GUARD Visitor.
VINCE Call me when you get out, they're always looking for centers in Italy...
And as he goes --
Julius is already seated in one of the cubicles, separated by a glass partition from the prisoner's side.
This is a big moment for Julius and he looks around as various prisoners are brought in -- -- and as a look of pleasure comes across his face --
GUARD leading an attractive, powerful inmate into the room.
The guy is Julius's age.
JULIUS trying to fight his excitement, watching as the prisoner moves toward him -- -- then past him.
Julius, confused, stares for a moment straight ahead across the partition, and now he's more confused --
-- because Vince is sitting across from him, dubiously studying him, arms crossed.
There are phones on both sides of the glass partition.
The room, it should be noted, is busy.
Julius makes a smile.
Vince just stares.
Julius mutters "excuse me" and gets up, goes to a nearby
JULIUS Excuse me, but I'm looking for Vincent Benedict.
GUARD You got 'im.
Julius turns, looks at Vince, and as he walks back to his side of the cubicle and sits, he is overcome with the wonder of it all.
JULIUS Vincent...
JULIUS dearest Vincent...
JULIUS I have rowed halfway across the world -- no, wrong, I only rowed one day but I came halfway across * the world -- I know you don't know who I am, but believe me when I say I have been waiting for this * moment all my life...
It's hard to tell what Vince is feeling but clearly the look of dubiousness is gone.
He picks up the phone on his side, gestures for Julius to do the same.
As Julius does, Vince at last speaks:
VINCE You gotta talk into the phone, * asshole.
Julius is confused, momentarily.
JULIUS Vincent...
VINCE listening, somewhat amazed.
Who is this loony?
JULIUS (V.O.) ...
JULIUS (V.O.) Dearest Vincent...
Vince glances quickly around to see that no one is listening.
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 33.
JULIUS (V.O.) I know you don't know who I am, but -- I came halfway across the world --
VINCE -- Whoa.
VINCE I still got another six hours to pay the money back.
VINCE You * tell those crummy Klane brothers that harassing a man when he's already in the slammer is beneath even them --
JULIUS -- I don't know any Klane brothers.
JULIUS I'm your brother, Julius.
VINCE Huh?
VINCE Again?
JULIUS I don't know any Klane Brothers.
VINCE Yeah.
VINCE Go on -- I got that part.
JULIUS My name is Julius -- I'm your twin brother.
VINCE Obviously -- the minute I sat down I felt like I was looking in a mirror.
JULIUS We're not identical twins.
VINCE I wouldn't be too sure.
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 34.
JULIUS You don't believe a word I've said, do you?
VINCE -- That's right.
VINCE I don't believe a word you said.
JULIUS Vincent, I don't lie.
JULIUS I am your brother.
JULIUS Let me help you get out * of here.
VINCE Oh...
VINCE you want to help me get outta here?
JULIUS Yes.
VINCE Well, money talks, bullshit walks.
JULIUS How can bullshit walk?
JULIUS Is that slang?
VINCE I'm in fast company here --
VINCE Listen, you get me outta here, I'll be whatever you want, best friend, brother, nephew, niece, grandma...
Vince gets up --
VINCE Just don't ask me to bend over --
A bunch of impounded cars.
Vince and Julius walk toward a small building in the center.
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 4/27/88 35.
VINCE Listen, 'twinny,' I hope you didn't blow your wad on those tickets, 'cause it's gonna cost a bunch more to release my car.
JULIUS I have some more money --
VINCE You do?
JULIUS I am happy to help you, Vincent.
JULIUS You're my brother.
JULIUS I love you.
VINCE Julius -- look -- ease up on the love talk or I'm gonna be tossing my cookies, all right?
JULIUS Tossing cookies, that is more slang?
VINCE Just gimme your wallet, okay?
VINCE As Julius sweetly hands it over --
As Julius counts out almost the last of his money to the police attendant, who hands him a set of keys.
Vince grabs them and walks out of the building.
Julius follows.
JULIUS I know what you're thinking?
VINCE No, you don't.
JULIUS You're thinking that this whole twin business is what you call 'bullshit.'
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 5/2/88 36.
This is exactly what Vince has been thinking.
VINCE Actually, I was thinking I'm going to need some more money -- to put gas in my car --
JULIUS You can take some more money --
VINCE I can?
JULIUS Sure...
VINCE We're brothers -- right?
VINCE Julius tries to drape an arm around Vince's shoulder.
VINCE Vince gives him a look.
VINCE Julius drops his arm.
Vince and Julius are walking down a long line of cars.
VINCE They arrest you, they put you * behind bars, they fine you and * then they hide your car.
JULIUS That's --
JULIUS -- your car, isn't it?
VINCE'S MUSTANG Which is what Julius is pointing at.
VINCE Yeah -- How'd you know that was my car.
JULIUS We're twins!
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 4/27/88 37.
Vince unlocks his side, gets in.
Julius, smiling and happy, starts to walk around to the other side.
JULIUS I'm so excited -- we'll go to museums together, discuss philosophy together, read books together -- play chess together --
VINCE -- Get lost together -- And on that, he GUNS his CAR the hell away, leaving Julius standing there.
JULIUS Deserted, alone in the sea of cars.
As a gleaming new Cadillac rolls up to the ticket booth.
Al leans out from the booth, taking in the car and its occupants -- two men, one in a Hawaiian shirt, one in a tanktop, both wearing Ray-Bans.
They look like they're going on vacation.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 6/22/88 38.
AL Hey, the new Sedan DeVille...
AL Very nice.
AL The driver, GARFIELD, just nods, holds out his hand for the ticket.
AL You guys must be going to Hawaii, huh?
AL Catch that good surf.
GARFIELD Something like that.
GARFIELD The two men just stare straight ahead, uninterested in conversation.
GARFIELD Al hands the driver a ticket.
AL There's plenty of space on level four.
AL The Cadillac accelerates up the ramp.
59    INT. PARKING LOT - INSIDE CADILLAC - DAY                        59 as it pulls into a parking spot in the enclosed lot.
Man #2, LARSON, opens an attache case, removes a cassette, inserts it into the tape deck while the driver wipes down the steering wheel, gearshift, etc.
with a cloth to remove their fingerprints.
OUTSIDE CADILLAC as the men get out, lock the car, wipe off the door handles, and then head for the elevator.
As Vince approaches a door on which a sign reads:
WHOLESALE PATIO FURNITURE * His door opens and out come two furniture MOVERS with a desk.
WHOLESALE PATIO FURNITURE * TWINS - Rev.
WHOLESALE PATIO FURNITURE * 6/22/88 39.
VINCE What're you doing with my desk?
MOVER Taking back the furniture -- you're six months behind.
MOVER He opens a desk drawer, pulls out a razor and begins shaving as he walks into his office.
Almost nothing is left but the phone on the floor, with Miss Busby, his secretary, standing by it.
Vince is stunned.
MISS BUSBY I tried to stop them, Mr. Benedict --
VINCE It was time to redecorate anyway.
VINCE The PHONE RINGS -- Miss Busby drops to her knees beside it.
MISS BUSBY Vincent Benedict, Incorporated -- Sports agent, artist's representative -- import/export -- automobile sales, rentals, and leasing -- wholesale patio furniture -- How may I help you?
MISS BUSBY Oh, hi.
MISS BUSBY It's Al.
MISS BUSBY As she hands him the phone.
VINCE Miss Busby -- Stacy -- this is a transition period for the corporation -- Why don't you take a few days off.
MISS BUSBY ...
MISS BUSBY Aah -- all right.
MISS BUSBY Whatever you say, Mr. Benedict...
TWINS - Rev.
6/22/88 39A.
MISS BUSBY (CONT'D) Oh, before I forget...
MISS BUSBY (CONT'D) Happy birthday...
She hands him a gift-wrapped present which he opens.
TWINS - Rev.
4/22/88 40.
VINCE 'Aqua-Velva' -- you shouldn't have --
She takes her purse, smiles, goes.
When he's alone, into phone:
VINCE I hope you got some good news, * Al -- *
On the phone in his ticket booth.
AL Brand new Caddy on level four.
VINCE Great, I'll be right over.
Vince drops to his knees in order to replace the phone into its receiver.
He then scrambles up, straightens his suit, heads for the door, making sure his pony tail is perfect.
As Vince exits, turns, quickly locks the door, turns back into the corridor just in time for this --
-- A huge fist slams brutally into his stomach.
Vince gags, falls to his knees as we: PULL BACK to reveal MORRIS KLANE, the biggest of them all, standing over Vince.
MORRIS KLANE Time's up, Vincent -- Got the money?
TWINS - Rev.
4/15/88 41.
He bends over, picks Vince up by the neck like a toy doll, straightens him up briefly, then buries his fist into Vince's gut.
Vince goes down.
Harder than last time.
In agony, on his knees.
It hurts to breath.
He finally manages to look up at the giant --
VINCE Did you hit me yet?
VINCE 'Cause I didn't feel nothin'.
He grabs Vince again.
MORRIS KLANE You gotta understand something, Benedict -- I like my work.
He pulls Vince groggily up and this time he's going for Vince's face.
He takes his time setting Vince up, getting his chin at just the right angle.
He's concen- trating on his work, so he doesn't pay much attention to the fact that the elevator door has opened behind.
Klane draws his fist back and is about to drive it into Vince's face when he suddenly pauses; the expression on his face, at first puzzled, becomes increasingly agonized as we REVEAL that --
Behind him, is squeezing a pressure point on Klane's neck, rendering him unable to punch out Vince.
Julius maneuvers the Klane off of Vince and forces him down onto the floor.
JULIUS These are most unfriendly acts you are committing.
MORRIS KLANE What?
TWINS - Rev.
4/22/88 42.
JULIUS I don't know what the problem is, but I'm sure it can be solved without resorting to violence.
MORRIS KLANE Okay, okay.
JULIUS Good.
Julius lets go of Klane, who gets to his feet, turns around, and instantly lets fly with his fist at Julius's face.
Here Julius effortlessly blocks the punch and goes right on talking.
JULIUS You moved too soon.
Klane spins and aims a karate kick at Julius's head.
Julius coolly ducks it and sends Klane crashing into a wall.
JULIUS An important rule in a crisis * situation -- negotiate first, attack last.
JULIUS You never negotiated.
JULIUS You don't know what kind of enemy I am.
Klane drags himself to his feet while trying to gauge what he's up against.
MORRIS KLANE Who are you?
JULIUS Vincent's brother.
VINCE We're twins.
Klane isn't buying it.
Seeing a fire axe inside a GLASS CASE on the wall, he SMASHES through and grabs it.
MORRIS KLANE You're firewood.
TWINS - Rev.
4/22/88 43.
JULIUS You have no respect for logic -- *
Klane charges Julius, who sidesteps his blow.
The axe is is imbedded in the wall.
As Julius grabs him.
JULIUS -- And I have no respect for those with no respect for logic.
JULIUS You're a very stupid person.
Watching as Julius picks up Klane with both hands and lifts him a foot up into the air, holding him there for a pause.
-- And this next is timed perfectly -- as he pushes the elevator button and...
ELEVATOR DOOR slides open and...
As he heaves Klane across the corridor into the open elevator Klane crashes down hard just as the door slides shut and...
TWINS - Rev.
4/22/88 44.
Shouting as the door closes on the crumpled Klane.
VINCE Tell your brother 'He messes with me, he messes with my whole family!'
Despite himself, Vince is definitely warming to Julius.
VINCE I like it when you hit people!
JULIUS I hate violence.
VINCE But you're so good at it.
VINCE We ought to go into business together.
VINCE You could be a boxer and I'll be your manager.
JULIUS I don't think I could fight for money.
VINCE No problem.
VINCE You do the fighting, I'll keep all the money.
JULIUS I'm worried about you, Vincent.
They reach Vince's Mustang and get in.
JULIUS How much money do you owe?
JULIUS Don't lie -- we're twins, I can feel your pain.
VINCE Why do you keep saying that?
VINCE We're not twins, we're not brothers, we're nothing, and you're only in this car because I could use a little protection these days --
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 4/27/88 45.
JULIUS Twenty thousand?
VINCE Due this morning.
CUT TO * Suddenly Vince bangs his forehead with the palm of his hand.
VINCE I don't know where my head is -- I forgot I promised this friend of mine -- Sammy -- I'd pick up his car at the airport -- do me a big favor, okay?
VINCE Drive this car back from the airport for me.
JULIUS I'd love to.
JULIUS Julius reaches into the glove compartment, takes out the car manual, begins speed reading it, running his index finger down the center of each page.
VINCE What are you doing with that finger?
JULIUS Learning to drive.
JULIUS Vince isn't sure what's going on at this point.
JULIUS Now Julius studies Vince's shifting moves, the way his hands work the steering wheel.
JULIUS Now he's back to the manual.
JULIUS Now he's staring at Vince.
JULIUS Vince and Julius's heads are both in motion now -- Julius's from the book to the wheel, Vince's from the road to Julius's finger.
JULIUS As their heads keep turning --
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 46/47.
Vince checks beneath the caddy's tires, then rises, frustrated.
JULIUS What's the matter?
VINCE That dopey Sam -- He did it again.
VINCE Forgot to leave the keys...
VINCE A lot of handicapped kids are gonna be really disappointed...
JULIUS Handicapped children?
VINCE This car was supposed to be auctioned off at their charity drive tomorrow.
VINCE Oh, well, let's go eat.
JULIUS Maybe we should try to open it ourselves...
Vince raises his eyebrows in mock surprise.
VINCE You think we should do a thing like that?
JULIUS Of course -- it's for the children...
Vince inserts it into the Cadillac's driver's-side * window, watched by Julius.
VINCE I saw a guy from the auto club do this once...
The door locks suddenly pop up in unison.
VINCE Whaddya know?
VINCE Beginner's luck!
As he takes a breath, opens the door, scoots inside --
-- and the instant he does there is this terrible shrieking SIREN sound -- -- Vince frantically scrambles around, lying on the car seat, trying to make it stop but he can't --
-- and then two things happen:
)O( TWINS - Rev.
7/5/88 49.
First, the car tilts and Vince is pitched unceremoniously forward, landing on the floor of the car under the steer- ing wheel.
He scrambles back to the seat -- it's not easy because of the angle.
Second, the SIREN STOPS.
Vince looks out the car window.
JULIUS holding the rear of the car several feet up in the air.
JULIUS When the back end is raised to an angle greater than 45 degrees, a mercury switch activates the automatic cutoff system.
JULIUS The alarm's computer thinks the car is being towed away and shuts off.
VINCE No shit...
VINCE It's beginning to dawn on Vince that there may be more to Julius than meets the eye.
The Cadillac passes by, Vince at the wheel.
A pause.
Now the Mustang comes along, Julius at the wheel.
He drives terribly, stopping and starting -- jerking along.
Julius suddenly puts his foot on the gas and roars past Vincent.
Julius is speeding like a kid with a new toy.
Suddenly the CAR PHONE BEEPS.
He locates the source of the sound, and picks up the phone.
JULIUS Vincent Benedict's car.
JULIUS Vincent!
JULIUS Where are you?
)T( TWINS - Rev.
7/5/88 PM 50.
VINCE (V.O.) Ya see that little dot in your rearview mirror?
VINCE (V.O.) That's me.
JULIUS Hi, Vincent.
VINCE (V.O.) There's a supermarket up ahead.
VINCE (V.O.) Take your foot off the gas and very -- very -- very gently put it on the brake.
JULIUS The brake -- right.
As Julius makes a sharp turn -- on two wheels -- into the parking lot and comes to a dramatic squealing stop that spins the car around 180 degrees.
Vince's car pulls in a moment later.
He gets out, gazes at the skid marks as a smiling Julius approaches.
JULIUS The brakes worked just fine!
VINCE Lemme tell you something about America, Julius -- nobody likes a smart-ass.
Julius and Vince enter the supermarket.
LINDA AND MARNIE are pushing a cart down one of the other aisles.
LINDA AND MARNIE Linda is filling it with birthday candles, cake mixes, etc.
)T( TWINS - Rev.
7/5/88 PM 50A.
LINDA Angel's food or devil's food?
MARNIE The answer's obvious.
LINDA There's only one Vince Benedict.
LINDA He's a force of nature.
)O( TWINS - Rev.
7/5/88 51.
MARNIE And that 'poetry' he pretends to write.
MARNIE They're old song lyrics, Linda.
MARNIE Linda stops pushing the cart and looks at her.
LINDA I know that -- Geez, you don't think I know that -- ?
LINDA It's so cute, the way he thinks he's tricking me.
LINDA Anyway, what's wrong about other people's songs?
LINDA Some guys tell you dirty jokes.
LINDA It just proves that Vince has a romantic soul.
MAGAZINE RACK Adjacent to the express checkout lane where Linda and Marnie now join the line.
MAGAZINE RACK Julius picks up a Playboy and begins speed-reading it.
MAGAZINE RACK His eyes widen at what he's reading, and seeing, and when he reaches the centerfold he audibly gasps.
MARNIE Excuse me.
MARNIE She reaches past Julius to take a copy of Cosmopolitan.
MARNIE Julius drops the Playboy, which falls open on the ground, with the centerfold revealed.
MARNIE Flustered and blushing, he bends down to retrieve it, watched by Marnie, who can't take her eyes off the sheer beauty of his physique.
MARNIE She's not bad...
JULIUS I'm sorry.
JULIUS I had no idea these magazines had things like that...
JULIUS inside them.
JULIUS Julius tries to stuff the centerfold back into the maga- zine, but only manages to crumple it.
JULIUS Linda and Marnie exchange a look.
)O( TWINS - Rev.
7/5/88 52.
MARNIE You didn't?
MARNIE Where've you been?
MARNIE A desert island?
JULIUS As a matter of fact, a small tropical island, in the South Pacific, about 300 nautical miles south-southwest of Fiji.
JULIUS I only got here yesterday, but already * I've found my wonderful brother.
MARNIE Your brother?
VINCE That's right...
VINCE They all turn and look at Vince, who's pulled his cart up behind them.
JULIUS My twin brother, Vincent.
JULIUS Linda and Marnie, stunned, look from Vince to Julius.
VINCE God you look beautiful in this light.
LINDA Vince...
LINDA I didn't know you had a brother.
JULIUS You all know each other?
VINCE Julius, meet Linda and...
VINCE Her charming sister, Marnie.
JULIUS Sisters?
MARNIE Twins?
)O( TWINS - Rev.
7/5/88 52A-54.
The girls stand holding their bags while the brothers are each in their cars.
VINCE Goodbye girls, see you soon.
VINCE And he guns off.
JULIUS Goodbye girls, see you soon.
JULIUS And he guns off too -- only in his excitement he's gone into reverse.
JULIUS I've only been drivng for an hour.
JULIUS Now he follows Vince.
MARNIE Why do I think I'm going to see him again?
MARNIE Like maybe tomorrow.
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 55/56.
Vince leads Julius from the garage to the front door.
Julius is carrying all the grocery bags.
JULIUS Linda is your girl friend, isn't she?
VINCE Yeah.
VINCE Kind of.
JULIUS Is Marnie your girl friend, too?
VINCE Marnie!
VINCE Marnie hates my guts.
VINCE She seemed to like you.
JULIUS She hardly knows me.
A beat.
VINCE That's the best way -- women love men who are mysterious and devious.
VINCE It keeps them on their toes -- makes them excited you know what I mean?
JULIUS No.
VINCE You do like women, don't you?
TWINS - Rev.
4/15/88 56A.
JULIUS Very much, they're...
JULIUS strange and sensitive and they have compassion.
JULIUS I have the highest respect for women.
Vince listens to this earnest declaration and tries to keep a straight face.
Suddenly the truth dawns on him.
VINCE Now correct me if I'm wrong.
VINCE You're a virgin, aren't you?
JULIUS That's private.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 4/27/88 57.
Vince clocks Julius's reaction as he removes an eviction notice from his front door.
VINCE He's a 230-pound virgin.
It's a small one-bedroom decorated primarily with garden furniture.
As they come inside, Vince is confronted by a reproachfully MEOWING CAT.
VINCE Alright!
VINCE Alright!
VINCE I got your food.
VINCE Yes!
VINCE 'Liver and Cheese,' 'Chicken Giblets,' all your favorites, Julius.
JULIUS You named your cat, Julius?
JULIUS Vince freezes, realizing the implications.
Vince is seasoning some containers of take-out food and popping them in the microwave, while Julius strokes the cat who shares his name.
VINCE The secret to take-out veal Parmesan is adding a little extra cheese.
VINCE I know you're probably used to growing your own vegetables and spearing fish in the lagoon, but here on the mainland we just nuke it!
VINCE The microwave ALARM sounds, and it pops open.
VINCE Dinner is served!
As Vince and Julius prepare to eat, they both turn their plates counter-clockwise, then dab their lips with their napkins.
They both reach for the salt at the same moment.
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 58.
They both freeze and stare at each other for a long beat.
Julius smiles and we --
A man, pushing forty, appears, taking a keychain with a caddy fob on it from his pocket.
This is WEBSTER.
Dressed in businessman's clothing, he looks odd -- but not necessarily frightening.
He walks to the spot where the car was.
It's definitely empty.
He looks at the Cadillac key.
Clearly, he is not happy at the turn of events.
They've finished eating.
VINCE So, let me get this right.
VINCE One of * our fathers was a famous football player, another one was a physicist at M.I.T. --
JULIUS He won the Nobel Prize.
Vince, playing along, rolls his eyes.
TWINS - Rev.
5/9/88 59.
VINCE Naturally...
VINCE so all of our dads were these big shots and Mom was, like, Superwoman, but she didn't survive our delivery.
VINCE I got sent to an orphanage while you were brought up in a tropical paradise by this scientist you do research for, but who doesn't actually pay you because you don't need money.
VINCE Did I leave anything out?
Julius ignores Vince's cynicism.
JULIUS I think it's important we try to find our fathers.
VINCE You mean, all those geniuses who contributed to the...
VINCE ...
VINCE Sperm milkshake?
JULIUS Why are you being so immature about this?
Vince throws down his napkin.
VINCE Do you know how many times I've heard stories like this?
VINCE It's every orphan's fantasy: 'My real Mom and Dad were rich and beautiful, but there was a mix-up at the hospital and I got switched with another baby...
VINCE But one day there's going to be a knock at the door and there they'll be with open arms, crying...
VINCE "My darling!
VINCE My treasure!
VINCE We didn't know!
VINCE How can we make it up to you?"'
VINCE I'm telling you this for your own good, Julius.
VINCE It's a crock.
Vince goes over to a trunk, rummages in it, comes up with a dusty mouldering folder from which he removes a yellow- ing piece of paper.
TWINS - Rev.
5/9/88 60.
VINCE I liberated this from my file at the orphanage.
VINCE Read it and weep.
Julius takes the paper and reads aloud.
JULIUS Dear Sister Anderson, your request for orphans benefits for Vincent Benedict has been denied.
JULIUS According to our files his mother did not die during birth.
JULIUS We have a current address for her at 172 Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles.
JULIUS Vincent's case seems to be one of simple abandonment and as such he is inelligible for aid.
Vince snatches the paper back.
Julius stares at him, just stunned.
VINCE That's right, Julius, she abandoned me.
JULIUS This letter was written thirty * years ago.
JULIUS We were five years old * -- Our mother...
JULIUS didn't die when we were born...
JULIUS You've known all this time where she was and you never contacted her?
VINCE I don't know about your momma, Miss Perfect of 1952, but my momma was a slut, and if she's still alive, I hope she's in a lot of pain.
VINCE She dumped me once -- no way she gonna get a chance to do it again --
JULIUS Vincent, if they lied to us about Momma for all these years, maybe they lied to her, too.
JULIUS We must find her, we must check this address.
TWINS - Rev.
5/9/88 61.
He can't hide the excitement.
VINCE Julius -- slow down -- I've got no time for this.
VINCE You go hunt down * Mom, I've got a cash flow problem * to deal with.
Vince goes to the PHONE which is RINGING.
VINCE What!
BURT KLANE (V.O.) We haven't forgotten about you, Benedict -- You better have our money tomorrow morning.
BURT KLANE (V.O.) Or else.
VINCE Or else what?
Suddenly, Vince's living room WINDOWS EXPLODE in a burst of GUNFIRE.
Vince and Julius hit the floor and try to shield themselves from the SHATTERING GLASS.
The sound of a CAR SQUEALING away outside the window.
JULIUS Everyone seems so angry in America.
A sign in front reads: "SOUTHLAND AEROSPACE."
The driver of the Cadillac (GARFIELD), and his partner (LARSON), now dressed in suits and ties, walk along an executive corridor toward the reception area.
GARFIELD The tests on the lower temperature gaskets look great.
LARSON Looks like an easy weekend.
As they head for Garfield's office, a SECRETARY tries to hail them.
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 62.
SECRETARY Mr. Garfield, there's a...
GARFIELD Not now.
As they enter they suddenly stop and stare as we...
* PULL BACK to reveal --
Webster, immaculate and well mannered, rising from a chair.
GARFIELD Who are you?
WEBSTER I'm Webster, it's okay.
GARFIELD on the sound of the name.
He looks at Larson.
A beat.
LARSON Christ, man, you were never * supposed to come here.
GARFIELD The deal was we were never supposed to meet.
GARFIELD You're supposed to be...
WEBSTER Driving that Cadillac to Texas?
WEBSTER Got my driving gloves, got my driving glasses, got my hat...
WEBSTER but no car.
GARFIELD * The car was there!
GARFIELD * The merchandise was in the trunk!
GARFIELD * Your instructions were on the cassette!
TWINS - Rev.
5/9/88 63.
LARSON (CONT'D) He wants more money.
LARSON (CONT'D) That's what this is about.
WEBSTER Let me explain something to you.
WEBSTER I have a reputation to uphold.
WEBSTER People put their trust in me because they know I always deliver the goods and I always come back with the money.
WEBSTER This whole thing is making me look very bad...
WEBSTER professionally.
GARFIELD This is bullshit!
GARFIELD The car was there.
LARSEN That's right.
LARSEN The parking attendant thought we were off for Hawaii.
WEBSTER The parking attendant?
GARFIELD He liked the car.
GARFIELD We'd put on those damn loud shirts so we'd look like tourists --
LARSEN He asked us if we were going surfing.
LARSEN He was a jerk.
Webster suddenly gets to his feet, smiles.
WEBSTER You know, I just realized that in * twenty years of service no other * client has ever seen my face.
GARFIELD (nervously) * I don't think that's a problem.
Webster pulls out a silencer-equipped pistol and puts a bullet in each of their foreheads.
They lie very still and very dead.
TWINS - Rev.
5/9/88 63A.
WEBSTER Guess you're right.
TWINS - Rev.

As Webster emerges from Garfield's office and then turns back as if to say goodbye, watched by Garfield's Secretary.
WEBSTER Thanks for everything, guys.
WEBSTER I'll see what I can do about those Laker tickets.
WEBSTER Yeah, I'll tell her.
WEBSTER Webster closes the door behind him, smiles charmingly at Garfield's Secretary.
WEBSTER They want you to hold their calls.
WEBSTER They're going to be working late.

As Julius jogs steadily uphill, checking the occasional house number against the address on Vince's letter.
An imposing security gate stands wide open as several cars roll through it and climb up the long driveway.
Julius, checking the address, sprints in after them just before the gates close.
As Julius jogs up to the front door.
The circular driveway is filled with cars.
Adults and children are visible on the grounds; it appears that a party is in progress.
Julius rings the doorbell, which is answered by GRANGER, a man of about 60; he's dressed in swimming trunks and sports an impressive physique.
He's holding the hand of a five-year-old GIRL.
Julius and Granger look at one another and, for a brief moment, hesitate, as if each of them finds the other vaguely familiar.
WEBSTER TWINS - Rev.
WEBSTER 4/27/88 65.
GRANGER Yes?
JULIUS I'm terribly sorry to disturb your party and I realize this might sound strange, but I'm looking for someone who lived here a long time ago...
JULIUS Mary Anne Benedict.
JULIUS Granger reacts; he's speechless.
JULIUS Julius hands him the group photo of his mother, six fathers, Traven, and Werner.
JULIUS She was my mother.
JULIUS Granger looks at the photo, then at Julius.
GRANGER You're Mary Anne's son?
GIRL Isn't that you, Grandpa?
GIRL Julius gently takes the photo from the Girl, looks at the face she pointed at, then at Granger.
GIRL Now Julius is speechless -- Granger is one of his fathers!
GRANGER Why don't you go help your grandma with lunch, honey?
GRANGER The little Girl disappears back inside.
GRANGER Granger, clearly shaken, looks at Julius.
GRANGER They told your mother that you died at birth...
GRANGER ON Julius's reaction, as we --
Trophies, framed photos, other memorabilia of Granger's illustrious football career adorn the walls.
GRANGER TWINS - Rev.
GRANGER 5/2/88 66.
Julius studies them admiringly while Granger looks at the group photo.
GRANGER I guess you could say I'm your father...
JULIUS One of my fathers --
GRANGER 'Mary Anne Benedict'...
GRANGER I haven't said her name aloud for over 30 years.
GRANGER She was the love of my life.
GRANGER The times I've wondered what would have happened if I'd married her...
JULIUS Why didn't you?
GRANGER She turned me down.
GRANGER Said she was afraid to have children.
GRANGER She took it real hard when they told her you died.
GRANGER She even stopped painting.
GRANGER Did you know she painted?
JULIUS Until yesterday I didn't even know she might still be alive...
JULIUS Who told her we died?
GRANGER 'We'?
JULIUS I have a twin brother, Vincent.
GRANGER There's two of you?
GRANGER She never * knew that, either.
GRANGER This really gets to Granger -- the injustice of it all.
GRANGER He points to Traven's face in the photo.
GRANGER Mitchell Traven.
GRANGER He supervised the experiment for the government.
GRANGER TWINS - Rev.
GRANGER 5/25/88 67/68.
GRANGER (CONT'D) He's the one responsible for all of this.
GRANGER (CONT'D) He still runs the genetics lab at Los Alamos, New Mexico.
JULIUS I'll go see him.
GRANGER Watch out for him -- he's kind of a dickhead, if you know what I mean.
JULIUS No, I don't -- but I'm learning.
As the Cadillac enters through a gate and makes its way past the hulks of dead cars towards the same body shop we saw earlier.
As Vince cleans out the glove compartment, pocketing some cigars and spare change.
He pulls the cassette out of the STEREO, glances at it, pops it back in, turns it ON, and hears:
GARFIELD (V.O.) Mr. Webster, I hope you're happy with the vehicle we chose for your little journey.
GARFIELD (V.O.) When you get to Houston, phone 713/555-0342 and * ask for Beetroot McKinley.
GARFIELD (V.O.) He will arrange to trade you a briefcase for the merchandise in the trunk.
GARFIELD (V.O.) TWINS - Rev.
GARFIELD (V.O.) 4/27/88 69.
Vince stops the car dead, the Body Shop Owner comes up to him.
BODY SHOP OWNER New Caddy?
BODY SHOP OWNER Let's check it out.
BODY SHOP OWNER As the chop shop Owner checks under the hood of the Caddy -- Vince moves to the back of the car and pops open the trunk.
BODY SHOP OWNER The trunk is filled with a sleeping bag that might contain a dead body.
BODY SHOP OWNER Vince unzips the bag, sees some kind of giant engine part.
BODY SHOP OWNER He tries to lift it out -- It won't budge.
BODY SHOP OWNER Vince closes the trunk --
BODY SHOP OWNER Vince looks at the Owner who's already counting out the cash from his bankroll.
BODY SHOP OWNER The car's okay -- I'll give you three grand.
VINCE Sorry -- the car's been promised for a kid's charity.
BODY SHOP OWNER Okay, four grand.
As Vince starts to drive away:
BODY SHOP OWNER Okay -- Six thousand -- that's as high as I'm going...

A piece of paper by the phone on which Vince is writing.
It's got Beetroot McKinley's name and phone number on it.
And also one amount: $20,000.
On the desk is a map with Houston circled.
Vince has just finished dialing.
The phone is picked up before the first ring is half over.
TWINS - Rev.
4/27/88 70-76.
A sign on the top of the building reads: "McKinley Aerospace."
VOICE (V.O.) Beetroot McKinley talkin'.
He doesn't know whether to shit or wind his watch just now -- God knows what he's into.
McKINLEY(V.O.)
Who's cloggin' up the line?
VINCE -- Uh...
VINCE Webster -- calling from California.
VINCE I happen to have some merchandise you might want --
102 INT.
McKINLEY'S OFFICE - DAY 102 *
A huge office in Houston.
We are looking at the bottom of a pair of fancy boots.
It blocks the view for the moment of the speaker, but we can see a briefcase on the desk.
McKINLEY * Well, bring it to me, son, and let me enrich you.
VINCE (V.O.) It's the amount of enrichment I want to talk about.
VINCE (V.O.) Boots down now -- we are looking at a very rich, very tough S.O.B.
VINCE (V.O.) McKINLEY Don't try and renegotiate with Old Beetroot, son --
Edgy.
His pencil bounces up and down on the crucial amount, the twenty thousand.
VINCE Look, Beetroot -- if we can't renegotiate we wither and die.
VINCE I'm not delivering any goddam Cadillac without knowing for sure I got twenty for my cut.

We can see the briefcase now by the way -- it's open and seems quite full of money.
105   INT. VINCE'S APARTMENT - VINCE - DAY                           105 clearing his throat, taken aback by the violence of Beetroot's tone.
VINCE I guess twenty seems a little high to you.
VINCE I'm a reasonable guy -- I'll take fifteen -- McKINLEY (V.O.)
VINCE Listen to me, you poor excuse for a warmed over turd, a deal's a deal --
VINCE -- But --
106 INT.
McKINLEY'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP - McKINLEY - DAY 106 McKINLEY Don't 'but' me, the deal is five --
VINCE (V.O.) I can do better than five here.

107   INT. VINCE'S APARTMENT - VINCE - DAY                           107 as the words "five million dollars" really sink in.
We are looking at what just might be the high moment of his life.
VINCE (V.O.) TWINS - Rev.
VINCE (V.O.) 5/2/88 79/80.
VINCE F-five million dollars...
VINCE He writes down the proper amount now: $5,000,000.
VINCE Then he kisses the piece of paper.
VINCE Beetroot?
VINCE McKINLEY (V.O.)
VINCE What?
VINCE I'll see you in Houston -- after all, fair is fair.
VINCE I'll just have to find it in my heart to live with your offer...
VINCE Vince hangs up, jumps up and screams with joy.
VINCE He puts the cassette in his pocket, crumples up the piece of paper, and sky-hooks it into the waste basket.
VINCE Five million dollars!
Al and his wife Carla are tied to chairs in the dining room.
Webster sits between them, drinking a cup of coffee and calmly loading his gun.
WEBSTER * Your boss at the lot told me you * were on duty when the Cadillac * clocked in.
WEBSTER * Now what's his name?
AL Okay...
AL His name is Vince Benedict.
AL Webster puts down the gun, jots down the name.
WEBSTER That's certainly a beginning.
CARLA I'm really disappointed in you -- ratting on your best friend.
CARLA TWINS - Rev.
CARLA 5/2/88 81.
WEBSTER My best friend who's been screwing my wife for three years.
CARLA You knew?
AL All three years.
CARLA And you never told me until there was a stranger listening?
CARLA Shit, what about my reputation?
WEBSTER Where can I find Mister Benedict?
AL I'm not saying.
WEBSTER Let me get this right -- You're protecting the weasel who's been * screwing your wife for the past three years.
AL He's my friend.
WEBSTER Well, I guess I'll have to beat it out of you --
WEBSTER Webster suddenly kicks over the chair with Al on it.
WEBSTER Carla screams --
CARLA Stop -- I'll tell -- He lives at 1622 Westridge Place -- He's got an office at the corner of Highland and Hollywood.
CARLA Webster writes it all down.
AL Thanks for saving me.
CARLA I always loved you, Al.
CARLA TWINS - Rev.
CARLA 4/27/88 82.
CARLA (CONT'D) It's just I couldn't resist Vince.
CARLA (CONT'D) It's those eyes -- he does this thing with his eyes...
AL I love you too, Carla.
WEBSTER No one's gonna believe this one.
As Vince comes out of his house, carrying a sleeping bag, pillow, some clothing, a six-pack of soft drinks.
On top of the stack is a map of the Western U.S., which he's studying while singing the song "Houston":
VINCE 'Going back to Houston, Houston, Houston...' Vince tosses the items into the back seat of the Caddy, just as Julius jogs up the driveway and collapses against the Caddie door.
VINCE He's red in the face, completely drenched with sweat, gasping for breath, having run all the way from Bel-Air.
VINCE Jesus!
JULIUS Vince, the most amazing thing has happened.
VINCE You scared the living shit out of me --
JULIUS I met one of our fathers.
JULIUS He told me of a man in New Mexico who probably knows where Momma is.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 4/27/88 83.
VINCE Great.
VINCE Julius, in his fervor, grips Vince by the shoulders.
JULIUS She didn't abandon you -- she didn't even know you were born!
VINCE Awww -- that's terrible.
VINCE Vince removes Julius's hands, slides him away from the door, and opens it.
JULIUS And she was told that I died!
VINCE Look, Julius, I'm in kind of a hurry.
VINCE Sammy wants me to take the car to Houston.
VINCE Much bigger bucks when you raffle for charity in Houston.
VINCE Julius takes the map from Vince, looks at it.
JULIUS -- New Mexico is on the way to Houston.
VINCE A lot of places are on the way to Houston.
VINCE I'll be back in a few days.
VINCE Stay in my apartment.
VINCE Run up my phone bill.
VINCE Throw wild parties.
VINCE Take advantage of me.
VINCE Vince gets in behind the wheel.
VINCE Julius marches around the car and gets into the passenger seat beside him.
JULIUS Vincent, we have to go see this man Traven in New Mexico!
VINCE No we don't.
VINCE Julius slams his hand down on the top of the dash.
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 5/2/88 84.
JULIUS Yes we do!
JULIUS And I'm coming with you!
JULIUS Vince, realizing that Julius won't be denied, tries a new tack.
VINCE You know -- you're right.
VINCE This is fate -- destiny -- But there's no way I'm gonna drive for 1500 miles with you smelling like that --
JULIUS You're right -- I'll take a shower -- be right back --
JULIUS Julius leaps out of the car and bounds into Vince's apartment.
JULIUS As soon as the door shuts behind him, Vince hits the CADDY'S IGNITION and begins SQUEALING out of the driveway in reverse...
JULIUS just as Linda and Marnie's car pulls into it, blocking his path.
JULIUS Vince slams his hands down onto the wheel in frustration.
JULIUS Linda and Marnie get out of their car, singing "Happy Birthday."
JULIUS Linda approaches Vince with a birthday cake, complete with lit candles.
VINCE Why does everybody have to like me so much?
VINCE Vince gets out of the car and, although it kills him, tries to put on a happy face for Linda.
LINDA Happy birthday, Vince.
VINCE Oh please -- It's not my birthday anymore --
MARNIE Happy birthday, Vince.
MARNIE Is Julius around?
VINCE * He's inside.
VINCE * Marnie walks into the house.
VINCE * Linda gazes at Vince's belongings in the Caddy.
VINCE * TWINS - Rev.
VINCE * 5/2/88 85.
LINDA Where are you going?
VINCE Nowhere --
LINDA You were going somewhere -- you weren't even going to say goodbye --
LINDA Vince, knowing when he's beat, whispers conspiratorially.
VINCE Okay, okay -- look, you can't tell anybody this -- not even your sister -- but I'm onto something so huge it gives me a rash just thinking about it.
LINDA Like what?
VINCE I got something in here --
VINCE -- I don't even know what it is -- that's worth a fortune!
LINDA A fortune!
LINDA That's great!
LINDA An apartment door opens, revealing a FEMALE NEIGHBOR of Vince's.
NEIGHBOR Never sleep with that man.
NEIGHBOR Never loan him money.
NEIGHBOR And never believe a word he tells you -- that's free advice.
NEIGHBOR She slams the door shut.
LINDA Vince...?
VINCE I borrowed a cup of sugar from her once...
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 5/9/88 86.
LINDA I'm coming with you.
LINDA I'm not letting you out of my sight.
VINCE No you're not.
LINDA I am because if you say 'no' one more time --
LINDA -- I'll tell everybody you're hiding a fortune in your --
VINCE Okay, okay.
VINCE Just don't let on to Julius.
VINCE He thinks we're going to look up our ancestors, like in 'Roots' or something.
Marnie snoops around, examines the group photo lying on top of Julius's suitcase.
In the b.g.
she can hear Julius singing in the shower --
JULIUS 'Put on your red dress, baby, 'cause we're going out tonight...' She puts the photo back as the sound of SHOWER STOPS.
JULIUS Julius emerges from the bathroom, clutching a towel around his waist, and freezes at the sight of Marnie.
JULIUS Marnie -- excuse me -- I was just taking a shower.
MARNIE (holding up a box * of cookies) * I heard you singing -- I baked some cookies for you.
MARNIE An awkward silence.
MARNIE * I guess it was a dumb idea.
MARNIE * TWINS - Rev.
MARNIE * 5/9/88 87.
JULIUS Not at all -- I'm really looking * forward to tasting them.
JULIUS * (a beat) * I should put on some clothes -- But I'm not sure...
MARNIE Oh -- don't mind me.
MARNIE She turns her back to him.
MARNIE Julius realizes he has no clean shirt.
JULIUS I hope Vince doesn't mind if I borrow one of his shirts.
MARNIE Just don't try wearing his pants.
MARNIE They both turn as --
LINDA throws open the door, with a big smile on her face.
LINDA Guess what?
LINDA Vince just invited us all to go to New Mexico and Texas.
LINDA Vince comes in behind Linda, trying to conceal his exasperation.
JULIUS That's a great idea, Vince.

HOLD. TWINS - Rev.
HOLD. 5/9/88 87A.
Now, from the opposite direction comes another car.
Webster is driving.
He spots the address, turns in and as he does --
It's pretty much a shambles as Webster ransacks the place.
Frustrated, he moves out of the room as we --
116    INT. VINCE'S BEDROOM - DAY                                       116 as Webster begins working it over.
He lifts up the mattress -- it's heavy -- pushes it to the floor and knocks the wastebasket over.
CLOSEUP - VINCE'S CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER As Webster unfolds it, reads Beetroot McKinley's name, phone number, and the sum "5 million dollars."
CLOSEUP - VINCE'S CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER Vince's CAT appears at Webster's feet, MEOWING.
CLOSEUP - VINCE'S CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER He reaches down and strokes it.
Webster is feeding the cat when he hears a sudden, VIOLENT POUNDING at the front door.
BURT KLANE Open up, Benedict!
BURT KLANE I know you're in there!
WEBSTER Your owner seems to be a very popular fellow these days.
As it crashes open, revealing Burt Klane and his two large brothers, Bob and Morris.
WEBSTER TWINS - Rev.
WEBSTER 5/9/88 87B.
Morris has his elbow in a sling and a bandage on his head, courtesy of Julius.
They spread out...
and then freeze at the sound of RUNNING WATER from the kitchen tap.
As the Klanes burst inside and see Webster turn off the tap and begin drying his hands.
He's friendly, solicitous, definitely non-threatening.
WEBSTER Howdy.
BURT KLANE Who are you?
WEBSTER It's not really important, is it?
WEBSTER I wanted to feed the cat before I left.
WEBSTER Webster starts for the door.
WEBSTER Morris (the really big one) blocks the doorway, cutting Webster off.
BURT KLANE I asked you a question.
BURT KLANE Webster shrugs, exhales.
WEBSTER Who are you?
BOB We're the Klane brothers.
BOB That's Burt and Morris -- I'm Bob.
WEBSTER Interesting genetic pool.
WEBSTER You're looking for Vince Benedict, right?
WEBSTER The brothers all nod.
WEBSTER Am I Vince Benedict?
WEBSTER Morris stares hard at him, shakes his head.
WEBSTER So what's the difference who I am?
WEBSTER TWINS - Rev.
WEBSTER 5/9/88 88/89.
BURT KLANE Hit him, Bob.
BURT KLANE Bob steps forward.
BURT KLANE Before he can do anything, Webster pulls out his GUN and SHOOTS him in the foot.
BURT KLANE Then Webster turns and SHOOTS Burt in the foot.
BURT KLANE The two brothers crumble to the floor, screaming in agony.
WEBSTER Your brothers seem to have a problem with their feet.
WEBSTER It could be contagious.
WEBSTER Morris immediately backs away and lets Webster pass by.
WEBSTER Have a good, good day.

Linda, in the front seat, has her head resting on Vince's shoulder.
Marnie has her head on Julius's shoulder as well.
She seems peacefully asleep while Julius sits carefully not daring to move.
As Marnie cuddles closer to him, her short skirt rides even higher up her thighs.
Julius sighs deeply.
His biceps bulge and one of the shirt sleeves tears apart at the seams.
Vince watches through the rearview mirror, knows what's going on.
Or rather, what isn't going on, yet.
He drives on through the night.
The car speeds by.
The car is being serviced.
Linda and Marnie are stretch- ing their legs.
LINDA Did Julius like the cookies?
LINDA Marnie shrugs.
MARNIE I'm not sure...
MARNIE he said they'd provide one hundred percent of the average daily requirement of fourteen source vitamins in a high-fiber form that's an integral part of a properly balanced diet.

VINCE Whoa -- get away from that window!
VINCE There's women and children out there!

JULIUS What?
VINCE You allergic to something?

JULIUS Emblazoned across its front is a Hells Angel Death head and the motto: BORN TO BE BAD.
VINCE -- Are just born to be bad.
VINCE It's you, Julius.
VINCE Oooh, you are so scary...
Linda and Marnie watch by the car as the boys emerge from the shop.
They stare at the T-shirt on Julius.
MARNIE Julius...
MARNIE As he walks past, Julius slaps her five.

JULIUS Thank you.
MARNIE See you later.
MARNIE Julius, blushing, climbs into the front seat while Vince leers out the window at Linda.
VINCE See if you can get us a room with a king-sized bed, okay?
VINCE Linda smiles at him, and winks.
VINCE Julius, misunderstanding the sleeping arrangements, leans out the window.
JULIUS That's not necessary.
JULIUS I always sleep on the floor.
JULIUS Vince looks askance at Julius, then pulls the car away.
JULIUS HOLD ON Linda and Marnie, gazing curiously after them.

The Caddy drives through this mysterious town in the mountains of New Mexico.
Julius and Vince have parked the car and are walking to a research building.
Vince is trying to humor Julius who is full of a quiet confidence.
VINCE Now promise me something.
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 5/2/88 93.
VINCE (CONT'D) If this professor Traven says he's never heard of Mom, and us twins, and all our dads, and the experiment, I don't want you to be upset.
VINCE (CONT'D) -- Because this is entirely possible.
JULIUS You still think I'm making it all up, don't you?
As TRAVEN, now a tanned, fit 70-year-old, stands framed in his office doorway, looking coldly out at Vince and Julius.
He looks like more of a prick than ever.
TRAVEN I don't know who you are and I * don't know what you're talking * about.
TRAVEN Now get the hell out of * here before I call security.
TRAVEN Traven slams the door shut in their faces.
VINCE Well, that's that.
VINCE On to Houston.
VINCE He leads a stunned Julius down the corridor, towards several armed security guards.
JULIUS He's lying!
VINCE Keep your voice down.
VINCE This place is crawling with security -- *
JULIUS For the first time in my life, I am -- (looking for the word) -- pissed off!
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 5/2/88 94.
VINCE Don't do this to me.
VINCE I got a car to deliver.
VINCE The last thing I need is a detour in the slammer -- Julius furiously stops and turns around.
JULIUS I'm going to make him tell us the truth...
VINCE No...
Traven looks up from some papers on his work table as --
HIS OFFICE DOOR comes flying off its hinges and crashes to the floor.
JULIUS marches inside, towards a startled Traven, as Vince tries to restrain him.
JULIUS Julius shrugs Vince aside, approaches Traven and shoves * the group photo into his face.
JULIUS That's our mother -- those are our six fathers -- that's Werner -- and that's you!
JULIUS Start talking!
JULIUS Traven decides, turns to Vince.
TRAVEN You turned out just like I thought you would, Vincent.
TRAVEN What did you do, escape from prison?
TRAVEN Vince stops dead, shell-shocked.
VINCE ...
VINCE How did you know my name?
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 4/28/88 95.
TRAVEN I named you.
TRAVEN Vince's jaw drops as he realizes -- *
VINCE * Holy shit.
VINCE * It's all true.
As CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY DOWN it, we realize this is a reprise of our film's opening location.
LABORATORY DOOR Chained and padlocked.
LABORATORY DOOR Traven unlocks it, pulls off the chains.
The very same one we saw in our opening, now covered in dust and cobwebs.
Julius and Vince take it all in; they're numb, while Traven seems in control again.
TRAVEN This room was sealed as soon as your mother gave birth.
JULIUS approaches a delivery table, touches it gently, looks back at Traven.
TRAVEN You came out first, of course...
TRAVEN We weren't expecting him.
VINCE gazes at the "blender" we saw Traven demonstrating in
VINCE This must be where you made the milkshake...
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 5/2/88 96.
TRAVEN gazes contemptuously at Vince.
TRAVEN We weren't making milkshakes.
TRAVEN We were making the most fully- developed human the world has ever seen.
TRAVEN Vince is not unhappy at this information.
VINCE But instead of just one perfect kid, Mom had two of us -- way to go, Mom.
TRAVEN Wrong.
TRAVEN The embryo split in two, but it didn't split equally.
TRAVEN All * the purity and strength went into Julius.
TRAVEN All the crap that was left over went into what you see in the mirror every morning.
VINCE Whoa -- I'm the crap?
JULIUS It's not true, Vince.
VINCE No, I want to hear this.
VINCE I'm left-over crap?
VINCE I'm no good?
JULIUS He's wrong.
JULIUS Angry tears well up in Vince's eyes.
TRAVEN Just look at him --
VINCE You tellin' me I'm a side effect!?!
VINCE TWINS - Rev.

TRAVEN You haven't got the brainpower to understand this -- Vincent, and I haven't got the time -- show's over.
TRAVEN He turns to go.
TRAVEN Julius grabs Traven, slams him up against the wall.
JULIUS Tell us where our mother is...
JULIUS * dickhead!
TRAVEN Whispering Pines...
TRAVEN it's an artists colony...
TRAVEN two hundred miles north of Santa Fe.
JULIUS If you're lying to me.
JULIUS I'll be back.
JULIUS Julius tosses him aside.
Vince is sitting in the car, slumped over the wheel.
VINCE My life just got flushed down the toilet.
JULIUS You're wrong, Vincent.
JULIUS Your life's just about to begin.
VINCE I'm genetic garbage.
VINCE Julius shakes his head.
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 5/9/88 97A.
JULIUS Vincent, we're twins.
JULIUS Vince looks at his brother.
VINCE (patronizing) * I know this is a touchy subject * for you, Julius.
VINCE But the fact is, * we don't look the same -- we don't * act the same, we don't talk the * same -- we don't dress the same.
JULIUS I know.
VINCE So how come if we're the same, we're so damn different.
JULIUS We had six fathers, Vince.
JULIUS We're different parts of a lot of different people.
JULIUS Vince is starting to get interested again.
VINCE Yeah?
JULIUS And remember, I was taken to a beautiful island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to dream, to create.
JULIUS But you had none of that.
JULIUS Vince remembers.
JULIUS All the bravado about loving being an orphan has gone now.
JULIUS You had nobody.
JULIUS Nobody to love you, nobody to trust you, nobody to encourage you.
JULIUS All life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself.
JULIUS Tears begin to well up in Vince's eyes.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 5/9/88 98.
JULIUS You're the missing part of my life and I'm the missing part of your life.
JULIUS And when we find our mother we can fill the missing part of hers.
JULIUS We won't be alone anymore, Vince.
JULIUS We can be a family.
JULIUS Vince looks at his brother.
JULIUS A beat.
VINCE A family?
VINCE You really think so?
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 4/22/88 98A.
Julius nods.
Vince thinks about it some more.
VINCE With like Thanksgiving dinner?
VINCE And Christmas trees...
JULIUS ...
JULIUS and a real home where you'll always be welcome.
VINCE Always?
JULIUS Even when you've been bad.
JULIUS Vince begins to brighten.
As Vince ushers Julius through the door.
JULIUS Is this necessary?
VINCE I'm not introducing you to my mother dressed like some goatsherder from Albania.
VINCE You need some new clothes.
VINCE A SALES CLERK approaches Vince.
SALES CLERK Can I help you, sir?
SALES CLERK TWINS - Rev.
SALES CLERK 4/28/88 99.
VINCE Do I look like I need help?
VINCE Here's the problem.
VINCE Maybe I'll try on a couple of things myself.
As Vince and Julius emerge, dressed in identical outfits; each in his own way looks like a male model from an Italian fashion magazine.
JULIUS Do I look okay?
VINCE You look better, put it that way.
VINCE We got to do something about the way you walk.
VINCE You're moving a tad stiff, Jules.
VINCE Ever see * Frankenstein?
JULIUS I read the book.
VINCE That's not gonna help.
VINCE You got to walk like you're moving in time to music.
VINCE I'm not talking about military marches now, I mean Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Archie Bell and the Drells and a couple of white * guys.
VINCE Julius doesn't have a clue.
VINCE Vince dons sunglasses and demonstrates a soulful strut.
VINCE Like this...
VINCE You just got to try to be cool, you know?
VINCE Try these on.
VINCE Indicating glasses.
VINCE Julius puts on sunglasses, snaps his fingers, tries to ape Vince's moves while Vince appraises him.
JULIUS * Am I cool now?
JULIUS * -- *
VINCE * Mr. Ice.
VINCE * TWINS - Rev.
VINCE * 4/28/88 100.
Linda and Marnie look up in amazement as Vince and Julius bop down the pavement towards them.
MARNIE/LINDA Wow!
JULIUS We know where to find our momma!
VINCE Everything Julius said was true.
VINCE I'm the product of geniuses!
LINDA I always knew that.
VINCE Of course, but it's nice to make it official.
JULIUS * Tommorrow we're going to finally meet our mother.
VINCE * And tonight we celebrate!
Vince is finishing dressing, making sure he looks partic- ularly fantastic.
Julius hangs back; something is bothering him.
JULIUS Vince, you've got to help me -- I've never been out on a date before...
JULIUS what should I do?
VINCE Talk to her, buy her some drinks, dance with her.
VINCE Girls like to dance.
VINCE Julius looks at his brother.
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 4/22/88 100A.
JULIUS Dance?
VINCE I guess you haven't done that before either.
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 5/9/88 101.
Julius shakes his head.
VINCE Well -- forget all that disco shit, everyone's seen it.
VINCE When I really want to romance a girl, I waltz with her.
JULIUS You dance with them?
VINCE It turns them to putty in your hands.
VINCE He shoves a chair out of the way, making a little room.
VINCE Okay, come here, put your feet by my feet --
JULIUS -- Thank you for this, Vince --
VINCE -- I said put your feet by my feet not on my feet!
VINCE -- Julius looks at his brother, then self-consciously takes his hands.
VINCE I'll lead, you follow.
VINCE Okay, one, two, three, turn...
VINCE ...
VINCE put your arm here -- you're breaking my fingers -- you're not wrestling a boar 300 miles south southwest of Fiji -- don't clench your teeth -- Vince begins to take Julius through the steps slowly at first, then as Julius gains confidence they begin to sail round the room, and we --
TWINS - Rev.
5/9/88 102.
Julius and Marnie in the middle of the large dance floor in a large club -- and Julius is waltzing magnificently.
Marnie, thrilled, stays with him step for step as we -- PULL BACK to reveal --
Vince and Linda, waltzing brilliantly, too.
The four of them have the whole floor to themselves as other dancers ring the area, watching and shouting encouragement.
The SONG ENDS -- Everyone applauds -- Our two couples head over to their table.
VINCE Well, you've learned to waltz.
VINCE Now it's time to introduce you to the wonderful world of getting shit-faced.
Vince, Linda, Julius and Marnie are seated at a table covered with quite a few empty beer bottles.
They are all a little drunk.
JULIUS Did you know they had beer in ancient Egypt?
MARNIE Er...
MARNIE no...
JULIUS Actually it was invented by the Assyrians, but the Eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation process.
LINDA You sure know a lot about beer.
MARNIE He knows a lot about everything.
MARNIE Julius polishes off the bottle, belches.
)J( TWINS - Rev.
6/16/88 103.
JULIUS But it's all from books.
JULIUS Until tonight I never had a beer.
JULIUS All theory, no practice -- the story of my life!
VINCE Well, we're going to change all that -- aren't we, Marnie?
VINCE Julius, embarrassed, looks over at Marnie, who's smiling sweetly at him.
JULIUS Can I ask you a question?
MARNIE Anything...
JULIUS Am I shit-faced yet?
JULIUS Linda, surprised, does a spit-take with her beer.
MARNIE You're getting there.
MARNIE Vince gets to his feet.
VINCE Please excuse me -- my back teeth are floating.
VINCE Vince exits.
VINCE Julius looks at Marnie, blushes, gets to his feet.
JULIUS I better see if mine are, too.
JULIUS Julius takes off after Vince.
As Vince and Julius approach the urinals.
The both si- multaneously flush before unzipping.
Julius smiles.
JULIUS You do that too, huh?
)J( TWINS - Rev.
6/16/88 104.
VINCE Not all the time.
VINCE Listen, Marnie's got the hots for you.
VINCE Tonight could be your lucky night...
JULIUS I don't think she really likes me.
VINCE Piece of cake.
VINCE You're nervous 'cause it's your first time.
VINCE Perfectly natural.
JULIUS Were you nervous?
VINCE I was twelve and she was a nun -- that's real pressure.
VINCE They both finish at the urinals and begin washing at the sink.
VINCE I got to admit it, Jules -- since I met you, life is getting better all the time.
VINCE Julius, a little smashed, can't hide his feelings.
VINCE He grips Vince by the shoulders.
JULIUS For me, too, Vince!
JULIUS Sometimes I'm so happy, I want to pick you up and hug you!
JULIUS Julius starts to do so, just as another man enters.
VINCE Hey, cut it out!
VINCE Not in here!
VINCE Julius releases Vince, who clocks the other man's reaction.
VINCE Go easy on the beer, okay?
)J( TWINS - Rev.

McKINLEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 138
BEETROOT Lookin' forward to it.
BEETROOT As Beetroot hangs up, the CAMERA SLOWLY PANS to reveal he is not alone.
BEETROOT In the b.g.
BEETROOT is a very hard-looking man, Beetroot's bodyguard.
BEETROOT And standing close to the desk is WEBSTER.
BEETROOT Sorry, Webster, looks like I'm doin' business with someone else.
WEBSTER I'd do the same thing.
WEBSTER You want the delivery, it's not your problem who delivers.
WEBSTER If you ever need me, my answering service forwards all messages.
WEBSTER And he's gone.
BEETROOT Put this in my personal file.
BEETROOT God, I love a professional...
TWINS - Rev.
5/2/88 105.
Linda and Marnie, both a little tipsy.
Linda suddenly freezes at the sight of Morris Klane scoping the room.
Morris is still wearing a bandage from his beating by Julius.
LINDA Did you tell anybody we were coming to Santa Fe?
MARNIE Well, I phoned work and told them we wouldn't be coming in for a few days...
MARNIE Oh, I forgot to tell you -- we've been fired.
LINDA Let's go to the ladies' room.
MARNIE But we just went.
MARNIE Linda takes Marnie by the hand, just as --
BURT AND BOB KLANE each with a cast on his foot, each supported by a crutch, force them back into the booth.
BURT KLANE Hello, girls -- Do you mind if we sit down and enjoy the music with you?
VINCE AND JULIUS approach the table.
VINCE AND JULIUS Burt and Bob open their jackets, revealing they have guns on the girls.
VINCE AND JULIUS Morris Klane appears behind Vince and Julius.
BURT KLANE This has gone way past a simple case of loan deliquency.
BOB KLANE We don't like getting shot.
VINCE What are you talking about?
VINCE We didn't shoot anybody.
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 5/9/88 106.
BURT KLANE It's no way to do business.
JULIUS What do you want?
BURT KLANE We want to take Vince out to the parking lot and kill him.
BURT KLANE A long beat.
VINCE That's kind of drastic, don't you think?
VINCE Morris grabs Vince roughly by the arm.
MORRIS KLANE Let's go.
JULIUS Don't touch him.
BURT KLANE (suddenly rough) * This is not your problem -- you * don't want me to hurt these lovely ladies, do you?
BURT KLANE He pushes his gun into Marnie's side.
MARNIE -- Ow!
JULIUS You moved too soon...
BURT KLANE What?
JULIUS The second rule in a crisis
situation:
MORRIS KLANE He's starting that funny talk again...
MORRIS KLANE TWINS - Rev.
MORRIS KLANE 5/9/88 107.
JULIUS If you choose to bluff, you must be prepared to have your bluff called.
BURT KLANE This is no bluff -- Asshole --
BURT KLANE Burt gives a small head signal and two very large men stand up from a nearby table.
BURT KLANE They each grab one of Julius's arms.
BURT KLANE Meet my cousins.
BURT KLANE Get these jerks outside.
BURT KLANE Just then, so sudden and quick that it's over as soon as it begins, Julius double kicks the seated Burt and Bob in the head.
BURT KLANE They're out cold before they realize they've been attacked.
BURT KLANE Without stopping, Julius whips his arms together in front of him bringing Sam and Dave into painful contact with each others' head.
BURT KLANE They, too, are now out cold.
BURT KLANE Vince uses this opportunity to stomp, with all his might, on the toe of Morris who's busy watching Julius dismantle his relatives.
BURT KLANE Morris screams and lets go of Vince, who runs to the nearby pool table, grabs a cue and slams it over the head of the now hobbling Morris.
BURT KLANE All five Klanes are out cold.
VINCE How many of those...
VINCE rules do you have?
JULIUS Quite a few.
JULIUS They were formulated by a Kendo swordsman in the 17th century, but their philosophical underpinnings can be applied to many other areas of life.
VINCE I bet.

7/5/88 108.
Julius is unpacking his suitcase on one of the beds -- arranging his books on the bedside table, hanging his clothes on hangars.
Vince watches him, glances at his watch, and begins to edge towards the door.
VINCE Uh...
VINCE we got cable TV, a fully stocked bar, free ice -- we're in great shape.
JULIUS Where you going?
VINCE I thought I'd just go and tuck Linda in for the night.
VINCE Vince picks up one of Julius' heavy tomes.
VINCE Maybe read her a bedtime story.
VINCE Don't wait up for me.
VINCE Julius looks fondly at his brother as he sees him to the door.
JULIUS What a day, Vincent, we visited our birth place.
JULIUS We bought new clothes.
JULIUS We danced the waltz.
JULIUS We get into a fight -- We've got this great room.
JULIUS It just doesn't get any better than this.
JULIUS Vince gives Julius a sly look as he lets himself out of the room.
VINCE Oh yes it does.
CLOSE - A TV SCREEN showing a clip of the "3 Stooges" at their moronic best.
JULIUS sits watching the TV, nodding in amusement, laughing, slapping his knee in pleasure.
)O( TWINS - Rev.
7/5/88 108A.
He returns his attention to the book he's been reading -- something the size of a dictionary -- but can't help returning his gaze to the TV.
He freezes at the sound of a KNOCK at the DOOR.
Embar- rassed by what he's been watching, he quickly turns off the TV, and goes to answer the door, still holding the book.
JULIUS You forgot your key -- I know.
JULIUS Lucky I waited up.
JULIUS Julius opens the door, revealing Marnie, who walks in right past him.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 4/28/88 109.
JULIUS * Hi.
MARNIE Hi -- Vince and Linda want to be * alone, so I'm afraid I'm going to stay here.
MARNIE Which bed should I take?
JULIUS Either...
JULIUS I always sleep on the floor.
JULIUS Watched by Julius, Marnie pulls the curtains shut, kills the overhead lights, all the while providing him with glimpses of various parts of her anatomy.
JULIUS She gets into one of the beds, turns off the bedside lamp.
MARNIE Good night.
JULIUS Good night.
JULIUS Julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed onto the floor between the two beds, then shuts off the other lamp.
JULIUS Silence...
MARNIE This mattress is awful.
MARNIE Getting out of bed, she pulls the blanket and pillow with her as she steps over Julius, who tries not to look up, and gets into the other bed.
MARNIE Sorry.
MARNIE Good night.
JULIUS Good night.
JULIUS Silence...
MARNIE This mattress is just as bad as the other one.
MARNIE She gets out, again dragging the blanket and pillow, puts them down on the floor next to Julius.
MARNIE She crawls under the blanket, turns her back to him.
)O( TWINS - Rev.
7/5/88 110.
MARNIE This is better...
MARNIE Good night.
JULIUS Good night.
JULIUS Silence.
JULIUS Marnie shivers, chattering her teeth.
JULIUS Are you cold?
MARNIE It's alright.
JULIUS No, please, take my shirt.
JULIUS I'm * baking.
JULIUS Julius strips it off and hands it to her.
JULIUS She puts it on and pulls the blanket over her shoulder.
JULIUS Again she shivers.
JULIUS You still cold?
MARNIE Just my legs.
MARNIE Julius lies there, thinking about it.
JULIUS Well, I could give you my...
MARNIE Thanks.
MARNIE Julius reaches under the blanket, removes his bottoms and passes them over.
MARNIE Marnie puts them on under her blanket.
JULIUS Anything else?
MARNIE I'd love a glass of water.
JULIUS Right.
JULIUS He wraps his blanket around his waist, goes into the bathroom, comes out with a glass of water.
JULIUS He hands it to her.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 4/28/88 111.
MARNIE Thanks.
MARNIE She spills the water all over her top and bedding.
MARNIE Oh, great!
MARNIE She starts stripping off everything she's wearing.
MARNIE Julius averts his eyes.
MARNIE Do you mind if I share your blanket?
MARNIE -- Mine's all wet.
JULIUS No -- that would be okay.
JULIUS They both lie down under his blanket.
JULIUS Silence...
MARNIE Could we switch sides?
MARNIE I like to sleep on the left.
JULIUS Sure.
JULIUS She starts to roll over Julius, then pauses directly above him and looks him dead in the eye.
MARNIE Can I ask you something for a change?
JULIUS Anything.
MARNIE Do you like me?
MARNIE I mean, even a little bit?
JULIUS I...
JULIUS I'm crazy about you, Marnie.
JULIUS But there's something about me you ought to know.
JULIUS Marnie tenses, expecting the worst.
MARNIE What?
JULIUS I'm a virgin.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 5/9/88 112.
Marnie glances heavenward, and silently mouths the words "thank you."
She smiles down at Julius and starts very gently kissing him.
Linda, dressed in a negligee, comes out of the bathroom area.
Vince, wearing pajamas, is on the floor, legs curled under the bed, doing sit-ups.
VINCE -- Eighteen -- nineteen --
LINDA You sick or something?
VINCE Julius gave me a few pointers --
VINCE -- Seventy-five -- seventy-six -- I don't need to exercise, but Mom's gonna see me for the first * time in thirty-five years, I wanna look my best.
LINDA She'll love you whatever you look like.
VINCE I know she will -- I have that effect on people --
VINCE -- One hundred and forty-three -- * one forty-four -- *
VINCE -- I just hope she's not too disappointed in Julius -- he can't help how weird he seems at the start --
)T( TWINS - Rev.
7/5/88 PM 113.
LINDA I think you're nervous.
VINCE Hey -- I sleep great every night --
VINCE -- what if she's disappointed in me?
LINDA C'mere.
VINCE Five hundred.
VINCE Don't want to overdo.
VINCE He goes into her arms.
LINDA If she's disappointed in you, then she's a fake -- who could want more from a son?
VINCE You're right.
VINCE I couldn't do this without you, Linda.
LINDA I know.
LINDA That's why, when we get back, I think we should move in together.
VINCE Whoa!
VINCE Move in together?
LINDA I'm not saying we have to get married or anything, and it's not about me wanting to keep an eye on you, either.
LINDA I just want to live with you.
VINCE I'm no good at playing house -- I'm grouchy in the morning, cranky in the afternoon, moody at night --
)T( TWINS - Rev.
7/5/88 PM 113A.
LINDA I promise not to try and make you happy unless you want me to.
LINDA Vince is clearly unnerved by the twin emotional demands of Linda and meeting his mother.
VINCE Why don't we sleep on this, okay?
VINCE I mean, I've got a big day tomorrow.
VINCE It's gonna be great -- taking my best girl to meet my mom.
LINDA Am I really your best girl?
VINCE There's nobody else, Linda, not anymore.
LINDA There better not be, because...
LINDA 'I only have eyes for you...' They kiss.
TWINS - Rev.
4/28/88 114-116.
They're both gazing up at the ceiling, bathed in after- glow.
Marnie has obviously just had the sexual experience of her life.
Julius is equally dazed and happy.
MARNIE Are you sure you've never done this before?
JULIUS I think I would have remembered...
JULIUS They start to kiss and we start to hear four RAUCOUS VOICES singing a great old ROCK SONG a capella.
It's our heroes singing.
The Cadillac is moving quickly through the extraordinary landscape.
The Caddy pulls up by a roadside flower stand.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 4/22/88 117.
LINDA Let's get her some flowers.
VINCE Good idea.
VINCE One bunch from me, one from Jules.
MARNIE And one from us -- Julius smiles happily at Vince's thoughtfulness.
In the mountains, which dramatically tower over a lovely, wide park-like area with a large adobe building and a few smaller satellite huts.
The car drives up a long, dusty driveway to the entrance, which is protected by high gates.
Our principals exit the car.
They approach the fortress-like gated entrance, gazing around at the magnificent scenery.
Both men carry flowers and seem self-conscious about the prospect of finally meeting their mother.
JULIUS It's very beautiful, isn't it, Vince?
VINCE Not to mention valuable -- real estate like this must be worth a fortune.
JULIUS You mustn't always think of money.
VINCE You got me wrong -- I'm just saying it's nice Mom's loaded -- that's a worry she won't have to have in her old age.
VINCE Julius smiles at Vince and rings the bell.
VINCE A MALE CUSTODIAN answers the door -- friendly but very firm.
CUSTODIAN Can I help you?
CUSTODIAN TWINS - Rev.
CUSTODIAN 5/2/88 118.
JULIUS We'd like to see Miss Mary Anne Benedict, please.
CUSTODIAN I'm afraid that's not possible.
CUSTODIAN As he starts to close the door, Vince takes charge.
VINCE We've come a long way.
VINCE I can assure you she's going to be very happy to see us.
CUSTODIAN I suggest you write a letter to the Benedict Foundation stating your business.
CUSTODIAN The Custodian politely closes the door in their faces.
VINCE * A foundation?
Our principals circle the wall, try a locked door to no avail.
They'll have to go over.
Julius boosts Marnie over the wall.
Linda boosts Vince over.
Our principals take in the scene -- a large, enclosed garden, with pathways, shady trees, all very lovely, with a great view of the sun setting against the surrounding mountains.
Their attention is drawn to -- A PAINTER working at an easel.
Several young artists are gathered around her, admiringly.
This is happening underneath a beautiful old tree and the sight is just lovely.
VINCE * TWINS - Rev.
VINCE * 5/2/88 119.
THE QUARTER They stand still watching.
JULIUS You think it's her?
JULIUS I do.
VINCE Gotta be.
VINCE Well, don't just stand there.
LINDA Introduce yourselves.
LINDA * As they take a step in the direction of the painter.
WOMAN Hey!
FEMALE GARDNER on her knees.
FEMALE GARDNER She's in work clothes, smudged, hair in a bandana.
FEMALE GARDNER Maybe 60, there's something terribly appealing about her.
FEMALE GARDNER She's her own woman.
FEMALE GARDNER She gets up from her knees now as they approach -- but not before we note the quality of her gardening -- it's the size Julius had back on the island.
GARDENER Should you be here?
VINCE That depends on how you feel personally about trespassing.
GARDNER Is he always funny like that?
JULIUS We'd like to see Mary Ann Benedict please; is she here?
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 4/28/88 120.
GARDENER 'Course she's here --
GARDENER -- climbing over the wall like that, I should call the police --
VINCE Please don't do that -- look -- this isn't one of your average everyday situations -- she's our mother is the thing.
JULIUS We're her sons.
VINCE Twin sons.
GARDENER -- You're comedians --
VINCE We're kind of a surprise.
GARDENER I'll bet you are -- follow me.
GARDENER She leads them towards the painter who glances up from her easel.
VINCE We were right --
JULIUS -- It is her --
JULIUS Now the Gardener leads them past the painter.
JULIUS We thought that that woman --
VINCE -- Is Mary Ann?
GARDENER No -- This is an artist's colony; there's a lot of painters.
GARDENER TWINS - Rev.
GARDENER 4/28/88 120A.
VINCE This is some chunk of real estate -- Mom owns it all, I guess.
VINCE They are heading toward a door in the garden wall.
GARDENER You can't really own something like that view over there, or that sunset, can you?
VINCE No, of course not.
JULIUS I can't wait to meet her.
GARDENER This way, please.
GARDENER The Gardener ushers them towards a door in the garden wall.
GARDENER She opens it, politely stands back, letting them go through it.
GARDENER They turn back to look at her.
GARDENER Mary Anne Benedict never understood why people wanted to buy her paintings.
GARDENER But for a brief period they were considered valuable.
GARDENER She used the money to buy Whispering Pines so that young artists would have a place to work.
GARDENER TWINS - Rev.
GARDENER 4/22/88 121.
VINCE She's not famous anymore?
GARDENER She never wanted to be famous.
GARDENER She just wanted to be left alone.
JULIUS May I ask you a question?
JULIUS Why do you keep referring to her in the past tense?
GARDENER Because she passed away, some time ago.
VINCE AND JULIUS They look like they've been kicked in the stomach.
VINCE But -- but you said she was here --
GARDENER She is -- I meant her spirit.
GARDENER Her spirit is always here.
GARDENER Excuse me.
GARDENER The Gardener gently closes the door in their faces.
ANOTHER ANGLE - VINCE AND JULIUS They haven't moved.
ANOTHER ANGLE - VINCE AND JULIUS Linda and Marnie try to console them.
ANOTHER ANGLE - VINCE AND JULIUS Julius still doesn't move.
ANOTHER ANGLE - VINCE AND JULIUS Vince shakes Linda off and stomps away.
Vince, out in front, hurls his flowers to the ground, kicks them, then hurries toward the Caddy.
Julius, still carrying his bouquet, picks up Vince's flowers, then places the two bouquets into a niche in the wall.
Marnie joins him and adds her flowers.
ANOTHER ANGLE - VINCE AND JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
ANOTHER ANGLE - VINCE AND JULIUS 4/28/88 122.
The sound of the Caddy's HORN HONKING.
VINCE Can we get the hell out of here?
The Gardener is back at work, staking up her tomatoes, as the female Painter approaches her.
PAINTER What was that all about?
GARDENER These real estate developers won't be happy until they turn this place into a golf course.
PAINTER Now they're climbing over the walls?
GARDENER They're shameless.
GARDENER They'll try anything.
GARDENER Those men claimed to be my twin sons, if you can believe that.
GARDENER It was really quite disturbing.
PAINTER Oh, Mary Anne, I am sorry...
GARDENER (MARY ANNE) It's alright...
GARDENER (MARY ANNE) You get over things.
GARDENER (MARY ANNE) I did have a child once, but he died * at birth...
Julius, Vince, Linda and Marnie are quietly sitting at a roadside table, eating some junk food.
GARDENER (MARY ANNE) TWINS - Rev.
GARDENER (MARY ANNE) 6/22/88 123.
LINDA You ought to be so proud of your mother, Vince.
LINDA She donated her house and her land and all her paintings to help young artists.
VINCE Do I look like a young artist to you, Linda?
MARNIE Vince, all she meant was --
VINCE I know what she meant.
VINCE And I know why she's here, too.
VINCE It's got nothing to do with my mother and everything to do with money.
LINDA You know that's not true.
VINCE Bull-shit.
VINCE Julius, who's been quiet and distant throughout, suddenly intercedes.
JULIUS Take it easy, Vincent.
JULIUS It's not her fault.
VINCE You hear that, everybody?
VINCE The * creature from the black lagoon * just put in his two bits.
VINCE I * should have my head examined for listening to you in the first place -- deal-of-a-lifetime opportunity and I'm driving around looking for a dead mother.
JULIUS All I wanted was to make us into a family.
VINCE Family, my butt.
VINCE There's no family here.
VINCE There's just me and three losers -- I'm leaving.
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 6/22/88 124.
Vince storms off, gets into the Caddy and squeals away, throwing Julius's suitcase out the window as he goes.
Linda and Marnie take off after him.
LINDA Vince -- quit acting crazy --
MARNIE He dumped us in the middle of New Mexico.
JULIUS We'll be fine.
JULIUS And maybe he'll be better off alone.
LINDA You don't know -- he's got something worth maybe millions in that trunk -- he could get himself killed delivering it.
JULIUS He's been getting out of trouble all his life, he's good at it.
MARNIE He may need you.
JULIUS I don't know much anymore -- on the island I was smart.
JULIUS Here, I've only made things worse.
MARNIE Don't you realize you could make things a lot worse if you don't do something.
MARNIE Julius -- you're still very smart it's just you're not thinking so well right now -- on account of what you found out at Whispering Pines -- but you're not alone, you know -- I mean, you live long enough, everyone's mother dies...
MARNIE No reaction from Julius.
MARNIE It's impossible to tell what he's thinking.

He's driving very fast and is on the car phone.
VINCE Okay, Beetroot -- It's time.
VINCE I'll be there tomorrow -- where do we meet and trade?

Julius is saying goodbye to Linda and Marnie.
He's carrying his leather suitcase.
JULIUS Don't worry, Linda.
JULIUS I found him once, I'll find him again.
MARNIE Be careful...
MARNIE Julius gives Marnie a rather chaste kiss.
JULIUS He turns away.
MARNIE watching.
JULIUS spinning back, grabbing her up, folding her into his arms, planting a world-class kiss on her mouth.
JULIUS HOLD ON the two of them.
JULIUS He puts on his sunglasses and strides into the airport.
Taking off in the New Mexico sunset.
TWINS - Rev.
5/9/88 125A.
The Cadillac driving into town.
He's real serious.
With planes landing in the early morning behind him, we see --
CLOSEUP OF JULIUS standing -- waiting -- trying to pick up the scent...
Julius strides purposefully along, carrying his suitcase.
He reaches a sign-posted intersection, looks in all di- rections, chooses one, begins to move.
As he does, a CREEP starts walking along with him, eyeing his suitcase, just like the Biker did when Julius first arrived in Hollywood.
CREEP Got a light, pal?
CREEP * Julius, without breaking stride, turns his head, looks at the Creep.
JULIUS Don't fuck with me...
JULIUS pal.
JULIUS The Creep falls back.
Vince pulls up in the Caddy.
TWINS - Rev.
5/9/88 126.
He drives inside a large warehouse, parks, gets out and looks warily around.
He opens the trunk, unzips the sleeping bag, revealing the merchandise.
BEETROOT Step away from that car, Mr.
BEETROOT Benedict.
BEETROOT Vince turns to see Beetroot coming out of the warehouse, accompanied by his BODYGUARD carrying an attache case and holding a gun.
BEETROOT The Bodyguard pats Vince down.
VINCE I thought we had a deal here.
VINCE The Bodyguard ignores him, checks out the trunk.
BODYGUARD This is it.
VINCE This is what?
BEETROOT You come here alone, unarmed?
BEETROOT You're just a fool who stole a car, aren't you?
BEETROOT It's a new, low- * cost fuel-injection system for * jet engines -- worth a fortune to * the company that brings it to the * market first.
BEETROOT * (ruthlessly; to * Bodyguard) What are you waiting for?
BEETROOT Vince closes his eyes, waiting for the bullet that he knows is coming.
BEETROOT When he opens his eyes the Bodyguard is holding the attache case open to show him the five million dollars.
VINCE Five million dollars --
BODYGUARD You wanna count it?
VINCE I trust you.
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 5/9/88 127.
Vince takes the case, gazes at the money, snaps it shut.
He can't believe he's pulled it off.
Beetroot and the Bodyguard get into the Cadillac.
The Caddy speeds away while Vince clutches the attache case to his chest and does a little dance of triumph.
The big score at last!
TWO SHOTS RING out.
Vince freezes and sees --
The Cadillac suddenly CRASHES against the side of another warehouse.
It's HORN is BLARING.
WEBSTER emerges from the shadows with a powerful pump action * shotgun.
WEBSTER He opens the Caddy and pushes the dead * Bodyguard off the horn.
WEBSTER Beetroot has a hole in his head, as well.
WEBSTER Webster turns and gazes back toward Vince who is sprinting for safety.
WEBSTER Webster calmly goes after him, reloading his rifle.
It's filled with forklifts, cranes and various forms of heavy machinery.
Webster enters and looks cautiously around.
WEBSTER All I want is the money, Benedict.
WEBSTER Just give me what's mine and you can go back to stealing cars and screwing your best friend's wife.
VINCE hiding behind some machinery, scurries deeper into the bowels of the warehouse.
WEBSTER moves forward, stalking him.
WEBSTER TWINS - Rev.
WEBSTER 5/9/88 128.
VINCE crawling along the ground.
VINCE He spots an open window up ahead at the end of the warehouse.
VINCE Nearer, to his right, is another window, closed.
VINCE Vince picks up a piece of pipe, aims, fires it at the closed window and as it breaks the glass --
WEBSTER FIRING at the sound.
WEBSTER He can't see Vince but he pours his fire at the window Vince broke -- large chunks of the * BUILDING EXPLODE off wherever Webster fires.
WEBSTER Pack it in, Vince, you're only wasting time -- I don't give a damn about you, just the money -- He's reloaded during this -- moving forward as we...
VINCE crouched near the open window, glancing back at Webster who has no idea where he is.
VINCE Noiselessly, he slides out of the open window, briefcase in hand, starts to run away --
WEBSTER moving in on the shattered window.
WEBSTER A bit irritated.
WEBSTER Vince, if you don't cut this horseshit I may have to hurt you.
JULIUS Leave my brother alone!
JULIUS As Webster whirls, looks around --
TWINS - Rev.
5/2/88 129/130.
Vince, outside, really chugging away now, doing his best Carl Lewis imitation.
Julius looking down at Webster from the floor above.
His hands are held high.
In one of them is a briefcase.
JULIUS I've got the money.
WEBSTER Well don't be shy --
WEBSTER -- come on down.
TWINS - Rev.
4/28/88 131.
As Vince puts distance between himself and the warehouse.
Suddenly he stops, as if he's heard or "felt" something.
He shakes the feeling off, resumes running...
and then stops again, shuts his eyes tightly, trying to deny what's happening to him.
VINCE No way...
VINCE this is bullshit...
VINCE Julius, you putz.
VINCE Vince turns and runs back towards the warehouse.
D173   INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                          D173 as Julius gracefully shinnies down a cable, lands near Webster.
He tosses the suitcase to the ground, backs away.
Webster approaches.
Julius' hands, as before, are held high over his head.
WEBSTER Just exactly who are you?
JULIUS Vincent's twin brother -- we're in this together.
WEBSTER Keep your hands that way.
JULIUS Don't be nervous -- I hate violence and I never carry guns.
Vince peering in through the window he jumped out of, takes in the scene.
VINCE Goddam ESP-psycho-voodoo bullshit...
Opening Julius' suitcase.
He pulls out Julius' old clothes, tosses them aside, then removes some books, books, and more books.
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 4/28/88 132.
WEBSTER 'Shakespeare's Collected Works'?...
WEBSTER 'The Mind of Confucius'?...
WEBSTER 'Advanced Quantum Mechanics'?...
WEBSTER What is this shit?
JULIUS I needed something to read on the airplane.
WEBSTER Yeah, well your flying days are over...
SUITCASE WITH THE MONEY flying through the air, landing near Webster's feet.
VINCE Put the goddam gun away -- you're a multimillionaire.
VINCE hands held high, appears, stands beside Julius.
WEBSTER He covers them both, kneels, opens Vince's suitcase, glances at the money inside.
VINCE AND JULIUS both with their hands up, look at one another and begin arguing.
VINCE I am never going to forgive you for this.
JULIUS You were going to get killed.
JULIUS I tried to distract him so you could escape.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 5/9/88 133.
VINCE I had escaped.
VINCE I was on my way to Brazil -- when I felt you.
JULIUS So, why didn't you go?
VINCE Because, thanks to you, I'm now not only a godamn psychic, I've got this disease called a conscience!
JULIUS Nobody ever said being good was easy.
JULIUS Webster uneasily monitors their argument.
VINCE How am I going to survive out there?
VINCE What are my friends going to think?
JULIUS You haven't got any friends.
WEBSTER Just what are you two talking about?
VINCE Butt out, okay?
VINCE This is family stuff, we're squabbling, it's personal, just take the money and go sit in the lap of luxury somewhere.
VINCE Try Brazil.
WEBSTER I doesn't work like that, you might talk to people -- (aiming the rifle now) Who wants it first.
JULIUS Shoot him.
JULIUS This whole thing is his fault.
WEBSTER Whatever you want.
WEBSTER TWINS - Rev.
WEBSTER 5/9/88 134.
VINCE -- Hold it, don't I get a say in this?
VINCE Webster points the shotgun at Vince, starts to squeeze the trigger when --
JULIUS pulls a gun from his sleeve and blows Webster's weapon out of his hands.
JULIUS Webster screams in pain, clutching his hand, dancing around.
VINCE You can be an irritating pain -- but sometimes you come in handy.
VINCE -- Where'd you get the gun?
JULIUS From the dead man in the car.
VINCE You should have checked if he had a gun, chump.
WEBSTER He said he didn't believe in them.
JULIUS I lied.
VINCE Ooooh -- you lied?
JULIUS I had to.
JULIUS Vince beams with deep fraternal pride.
JULIUS Then he turns to Webster and snatches the case back.
VINCE Looks like you messed with the wrong people, wise guy.
VINCE Webster shrugs and takes out a cigarette.
VINCE TWINS - Rev.
VINCE 5/9/88 135.
WEBSTER You got lucky.
WEBSTER He lights it with his lighter.
WEBSTER Suddenly Julius smells something.
WEBSTER Bad.
WEBSTER But your luck just ran out.
WEBSTER A stream of gas is pouring out of the drums that Webster punctured whilst he was shooting at Vince.
WEBSTER It runs in a broad stream across the warehouse floor, right beneath Julius and Vince's feet.
WEBSTER Webster is holding his cigarette out, ready to drop it in the fuel and incin- erate them.
WEBSTER Drop the gun and give me back the case, or we're gonna have ourselves some barbecued Benedict.
WEBSTER Julius drops the gun and Vince slowly hands back the case.
WEBSTER Webster smiles and backs off down the stream of gas, still holding out the cigarette.
WEBSTER He stops at the very edge of the building.
WEBSTER Well, I guess this is goodbye.
WEBSTER He raises the cigarette, ready to throw it.
JULIUS Wait a minute.
JULIUS Webster looks up.
JULIUS You've forgotten something.
JULIUS Webster grips the case tighter.
WEBSTER I don't think so.
WEBSTER Julius nods.
JULIUS The third rule in a crisis situation.
JULIUS Julian leans calmly against the warehouse wall, supported by one arm.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 5/9/88 136.
WEBSTER The third rule?
WEBSTER Julius's hand has pressed a button in a metal cage.
JULIUS Duck.
JULIUS Suddenly the load hanging from the boom of a nearby crane smashes into Webster's back, and then dumps on him, burying him in rubble.
VINCE Duck?
VINCE Duck?
VINCE You are developing real style, Julius.
JULIUS drapes his arm around Vince as they walk towards the unharmed attache case full of money.
JULIUS You came back for me.
VINCE Yeah, yeah, yeah.
JULIUS I always knew you would.
VINCE You're my brother, right?
VINCE We're family, right?
JULIUS Thank you, Vincent.
VINCE We're a rich family, right?
VINCE Both reach for the attache case at the same time.
JULIUS We're a good family.
JULIUS I'm sorry, Vince, but we have to return the money.
JULIUS TWINS - Rev.
JULIUS 5/9/88 137.
VINCE Return the money?!?
VINCE Are you nuts?!?
VINCE This is dirty money, * Julius -- it doesn't belong to anybody --
JULIUS -- Including us -- think how much * better you'll feel when it's out of our lives --
VINCE -- I won't -- I won't feel one bit better -- I'll never feel better, not if I live to be...
VINCE oh no -- * As the sound of POLICE SIRENS get LOUDER we --

A large photo of Vince and Julius being handed a check, with an accompanying headline that reads:
RETURN CASH, STOLEN ENGINE" CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal we are --
Mary Anne Benedict, seated at a breakfast table, stares at the newspaper in astonishment.
It's being held in front of her by the Painter from the earlier scene, who gently places the newspaper into Mary Anne's hands.
PAINTER I think you'd better read this...
TWINS - Rev.
5/9/88 137A.
Traven is reading a newspaper with his feet up on the desk.
It has the same headline and photo.
MARY ANNE * You stole my family, you lying son of a bitch!
MARY ANNE * Traven looks up just as Mary Anne's fist comes crashing into his face and sends him flying.

As Linda comes through the door, gets her mail from the mailbox.
She turns and comes face-to-face with Vince, standing there with a contrite look on his face.
VINCE Linda, I --
LINDA What the hell are you doing here?
VINCE You wouldn't answer my calls or my letters, so I...
VINCE Look, I made a terrible mistake and I apologize and I want to tell you that I'm a changed man.
VINCE Linda is almost buying it, but then --
LINDA How did you get in here?
VINCE Well, there was a window in the back that --
LINDA Typical.
LINDA She walks past him, approaches her door, puts in the key.
LINDA Vince follows, speaking softly, his sincerity absolutely genuine.
VINCE All I ask is for another chance.
VINCE I know I probably don't deserve it, but --
LINDA You're right, you don't deserve it.
LINDA She opens her door, walks in, and slams it in his face.
She sighs, turns from the door, and sees --

ROSES Dozens of them -- everywhere -- all over her apartment -- beautifully arranged -- in gorgeous vases.
ON LINDA Taking it all in, her resistance melting.
ON LINDA She turns, flings open the door, looks out -- no sign of Vince...
ON LINDA until CAMERA TILTS DOWN to reveal Vince on his knees.
VINCE I had to break into your apartment, but --
LINDA Vince, they're beautiful.
VINCE So, do you forgive me?
VINCE Linda hesitates.
LINDA Yes, but...
VINCE But?
VINCE Vince looks at her, understands.
VINCE You mean, that matter we talked about once and never really resolved.
LINDA What matter is that?
VINCE The matter of you and me living together.
LINDA What about it?
LINDA Vince gets to his feet.
VINCE Your place or mine?
VINCE They rush into each other's arms.

CLOSE A NEON SIGN It reads: "The Benedict Corporation."
CLOSE A NEON SIGN CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal we are -- inside Vince's office.
CLOSE A NEON SIGN * The offices have been redecorated -- they look serious, professional, and are filled with computer terminals and other high-tech equipment.
CLOSE A NEON SIGN Julius is sorting through a stack of mail while Vince talks to a prospective client on the phone.
CLOSE A NEON SIGN Both of them are wearing suits and ties.
VINCE What do we do?
VINCE Most people on this planet cause problems -- the Benedict Corporation solves them.
VINCE We're a consulting firm -- a think-tank -- sort of like the Rand Corporation -- only smarter!
VINCE Tuesday at three.
VINCE See you then.
VINCE Vince hangs up the phone, loosens his tie.
VINCE Julius excitedly holds up a stack of letters.
JULIUS Look at this, Vince -- proposals from the Red Cross, UNICEF, the World Health Organization -- we should only have clients who do humanitarian work.
VINCE Just as long as they pay -- we're not running a charity, you know.
VINCE The sound of FOOTSTEPS down the corridor, then a tentative KNOCK at the DOOR.
VINCE Come in!
THE DOOR As it opens, revealing Mary Anne Benedict, not looking at all like the gardener they met in Whispering Pines.
VINCE AND JULIUS Confused, just look at her for a moment.

MARY ANNE It's so incredible I'm not even sure which one of you is which.
VINCE AND JULIUS Look at one another, then at Mary Anne, realizing at the same time that she's their mother!
THREE OF THEM Staring at each other in silence, until --
MARY ANNE You see, I didn't believe you, I mean who would believe a story like your story -- crazy -- They lied to me all these years...
MARY ANNE And they lied to you...
MARY ANNE But you found one another ...
MARY ANNE And you found me...
MARY ANNE Please -- God -- one of you say something.
VINCE Momma?
VINCE Mary Anne nods.
JULIUS Mamma?
JULIUS She nods again.

JULIUS Now there are tears on his face, too.
JULIUS He goes to them, gently puts his arms around them, lifts them both up in to the air, cradling them.
JULIUS They're laughing.
JULIUS They're crying.
JULIUS They're holding each other.
JULIUS No words are necessary.
JULIUS Slowly...

PULL BACK to reveal we are --
EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY In front of the merry-go-round.
EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY Werner purchases a hand- ful of tickets from the vendor, hands one each to Mary Anne, Linda and Marnie.
MARY ANNE I just can't get over how alike they are...
MARY ANNE The three women all turn and gaze affectionately back at --
VINCE AND JULIUS Walking along the path behind them.
VINCE AND JULIUS We assume it's them the women were discussing, until we notice that each of them is pushing a double-stroller with identical twin babies inside!
VINCE AND JULIUS It's the twin children that are the source of the women's wonder, and Vince and Julius' as well.
VINCE AND JULIUS Vince and Julius both yawn simultaneously.
JULIUS They kepp you up all night again, too?
)U( TWINS - Rev.
7/25/88 141.
VINCE Sceaming in stereo.
VINCE They both stop the strollers, look down lovingly at their kids, begin fondling them.
VINCE Vince and Julius, simultan- eously flip identical baby rattles and shake them at their twins.
JULIUS I think you need your diaper changed.
JULIUS What a surprise -- so do you.
JULIUS Vince becomes aware of the condition of his kids' diapers.
VINCE Not you, too -- It's not a competition, you know.
VINCE They both start pushing their strollers again.
JULIUS Just think what we'd be like if we'd been raised together.
VINCE Now that's a scary thought.
VINCE They both yawn simultaneously once again.
Vince and Julius are sitting on adjoining horses.
Linda and Marnie hand their sons up to them, watched proudly by Mary Anne.
The merry-go-round starts moving, and the last image we see is of Vince and Julius on the horses, holding their twin sons.
