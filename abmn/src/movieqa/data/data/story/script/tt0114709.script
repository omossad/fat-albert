"TOY STORY" Original Story by John Lasseter Pete Docter Andrew Stanton Joe Ranft
"TOY STORY" Screenplay by Joss Whedon Andrew Stanton Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow
FINAL DRAFT November 1995
A row of moving boxes lie on the floor of the room.
They are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature Western town.
The bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the impression of sky.
One of the boxes has a children's illustrated "WANTED" poster of a Mr. Potato Head taped to it.
A MR.
POTATO HEAD DOLL is set in front of the poster.
The VOICE OVER of ANDY, a 6-year-old boy, can be heard acting out all the voices of the scene.
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) Alright everyone, this is a stick- up!
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) Don't anybody move!
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) Now empty that safe!
A GROUP OF TOYS have been crowded together in front of the "BANK" box.
Andy's hand lowers a CERAMIC PIGGY BANK in front of Mr.
Potato Head and shakes out a pile of coins to the floor.
Mr.
Potato Head kisses the coins.
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) Ooh!
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) Money.
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) Money.
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) Money.
A porcelain figurine of the shepherdess, BO PEEP, is brought into the scene.
ANDY (AS BO PEEP) Stop it!
ANDY (AS BO PEEP) Stop it, you mean old potato!
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) Quiet Bo Peep, or your sheep get run over!
The companion porcelain sheep are placed in the center of a Hot Wheels track loop.
ANDY (AS SHEEP) Heeeeelp!
ANDY (AS SHEEP) BAAAAA!
ANDY (AS SHEEP) Heeeelp us!
ANDY (AS BO PEEP) Oh, no!
ANDY (AS BO PEEP) Not my sheep!
ANDY (AS BO PEEP) Somebody do something!
WOODY, a pull-string doll cowboy, enters into the scene opposite the inanimate spud.
Andy's hand pulls on the ring in the center of Woody's back.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) Reach for the sky.
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) Oh, no!
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) Sheriff Woody!!
ANDY (AS WOODY) I'm here to stop you, One-Eyed Bart.
Andy's hand pulls out one of Mr. Potato Head's eyes.
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) Doooooh!
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) How'd you know it was me!
ANDY (AS WOODY) Are you gonna come quietly?
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) You can't touch me Sheriff!
ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD) I brought my attack dog with a built- in force field!
Andy places a TOY DOG, with a SLINKY for a mid-section, in front of Mr. Potato Head and stretches him out.
ANDY (AS WOODY) Well I brought my DINOSAUR, who eats force field dogs!!
Andy reveals a PLASTIC TYRANNOSAURUS REX, who stomps on the Slinky Dog.
ANDY (AS WOODY) You're goin' to jail, Bart.
Andy picks up Mr. Potato Head and places him in a baby crib in the room.
A cardboard sign is taped to the bars with the word "JAIL" written in crayon.
ANDY (AS WOODY) Say good-bye to the wife and tatertots.
Andy's 1-year-old sister, MOLLY, crawls over and picks up Mr.
Potato Head.
She sucks on him for a beat then proceeds to pound the toy repeatedly against the rail of her crib, forcing some of his parts loose.
Andy, wearing a cowboy hat himself, picks up Woody off the floor.
ANDY You saved the day again, Woody.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) You're my favorite deputy.
SONG "YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME" plays while Andy does various activities with Woody:
-- Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cows drawn on the other side.
He grabs a jump rope and pretends Woody is lassoing the cattle.
ANDY C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.
-- Andy then rides Woody around on an RC (remote control) car, and herds the remaining "cow" boxes under Molly's crib.
-- Andy places Woody on the top of the stairwell banister allowing the doll to slide downstairs.
Andy races ahead and catches him at the bottom.
-- Andy & Woody fall into the La-Z-Boy chair and spin around and around.
Next, Andy uses the La-Z-Boy foot rest as a catapult.
Andy flings Woody across the room to the sofa.
ANDY Score!
Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking to his mother.
ANDY Wow!
ANDY Cool!
MRS. DAVIS Whadda ya think?
ANDY Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
MRS.
DAVIS, Andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has just finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons.
A banner is draped across the archway.
It reads: "Happy Birthday Andy."
Woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday decorations.
ANDY Can we leave this up 'til we move?
MRS. DAVIS Well, sure, we can leave it up.
ANDY Yeah!
MRS. DAVIS Now go get Molly.
MRS. DAVIS Your friends are going to be here any minute.
ANDY Okay.
Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.
ANDY It's party time, Woody!
Andy and Woody enter the room.
Molly is still banging Potato Head against her crib railing.
Andy tips Woody's hat at her.
ANDY Howdy, Little Lady!
He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one last time.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.
ANDY C'mon, Molly.
ANDY Oh, you're getting heavy!
ANDY See ya later, Woody.
Andy exits.
Woody's eyes come to life.
The cowboy doll sits up, his expression changing from a smile to worry.
WOODY Pull my string!
WOODY The birthday party's today?!
Woody thinks.
WOODY Okay, everybody.
WOODY Coast is clear.
The bedroom comes alive.
TOYS emerge from the toy box, the closet, the shelves, etc...
in a flurry of activity.
POTATO HEAD, his body parts strewn across the floor, sits himself upright and begins to re-assemble himself.
MR. POTATO HEAD Ages three and up.
MR. POTATO HEAD It's on my box.
MR. POTATO HEAD Ages three and up!
MR. POTATO HEAD I'm not supposed to be babysitting Princess Drool.
HAMM, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coin slot.
Potato Head walks up to him.
All his facial pieces are in the wrong slots.
MR. POTATO HEAD Hey, Hamm!
MR. POTATO HEAD Look!
MR. POTATO HEAD I'm Picasso!
HAMM I don't get it.
Hamm walks away.
MR. POTATO HEAD You uncultured swine!
MR. POTATO HEAD What are you looking at, ya hockey puck?!
Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine.
Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity.
He turns to a plastic green army man, SARGENT, standing on the night stand.
WOODY Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
SARGENT Sir!
SARGENT No Sir!
WOODY Okay, thank you.
WOODY At ease.
Woody hops off the bed.
WOODY Hey, Slinky?
SLINKY Right here, Woody!
A toy Slinky dog, SLINKY, appears from under the bed pushing out a checker board set.
He begins to place the checkers on the board.
SLINKY I'm red this time.
WOODY No, Slink --
SLINKY Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
WOODY Not now, Slink.
WOODY I've got some bad news.
SLINKY Bad news?!
WOODY Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in the room are watching.
He leans in close to Slinky.
WOODY Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
SLINKY Got it.
Slinky shuffles off.
WOODY Be HAPPY!
Slinky perks up his gait and LAUGHS HARD.
Woody proceeds in the other direction.
He passes a toy ROBOT and SNAKE partially hidden under the bedspread.
WOODY Staff meeting, everybody.
WOODY Snake, Robot -- podium duty.
Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantly follow Woody.
Woody walks past an Etch-A-Sketch, ETCH, going the other direction.
WOODY Hey Etch!
WOODY Draw!
Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters.
Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch-A-Sketch etches a gun on its screen.
WOODY Oh!!
WOODY You got me again, Etch!
WOODY You've been working on that draw.
WOODY Fastest knobs in the west.
Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor.
SLINKY Got a staff meeting, you guys, come on, let's go!
Robot and Snake begin constructing a podium made out of Legos and a Tinker Toy tub while Woody searches the floor.
WOODY Now where is that -- ?
WOODY Aw, hey, who moved my doodle pad way over here?
Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and walks over to it.
As he reaches down to pick it up...
REX, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody.
WOODY Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Rex suddenly turns timid.
REX Were you scared?
REX Tell me honestly.
WOODY I was close to being scared that time.
Woody heads back to the podium.
Rex follows.
REX I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it.
REX I think I'm just coming off as annoying.
A crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards BO PEEP, the porcelain figurine.
WOODY Aach!
WOODY -- Oh, hi, Bo.
BO PEEP I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
WOODY Oh, hey - it was nothing.
BO PEEP Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
WOODY Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack of ABC blocks.
BO PEEP Remember, I'm just a couple of blocks away.
Woody is left lovestruck.
All the rest of the toys in the room are filing past Slinky.
SLINKY Come on, come on!
SLINKY Smaller toys up front.
Woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room.
SLINKY Hey, Woody!
SLINKY C'mon!
Woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium.
The toys crowd together as Woody steps up to the podium.
MIKE, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to Woody and indicates his microphone.
MIKE Ahem!
WOODY Oh, thanks, Mike.
WOODY Okay --
WOODY Oh, whoa, step back --
Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback.
WOODY Hello?
WOODY Check?
WOODY Better?
WOODY Great.
WOODY Everybody hear me?
WOODY Up on the shelf, can you hear me?
WOODY Great!
WOODY Okay, first item today...oh, yeah.
WOODY Has everyone picked a moving buddy?
The toys all MOAN.
HAMM Moving buddy?!
HAMM You can't be serious!
REX Well I didn't know we were supposed to have one already.
MR. POTATO HEAD Do we have to hold hands?
The toys LAUGH and SNICKER.
WOODY Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a big joke.
WOODY We've only got one week left before the move.
WOODY I don't want any toys left behind.
WOODY A moving buddy -- if you don't have one, get one!
WOODY Alright, next...uh...oh, yes.
WOODY Tuesday night's "Plastic Corrosion Awareness" meeting was, I think, a big success and we want to thank Mr.
WOODY Spell for putting that on for us.
WOODY Thank you, Mr. Spell.
The words "You're welcome" scroll across Mr. Spell's display screen as he speaks.
MR. SPELL You're welcome.
WOODY Ok, uh...oh yes.
WOODY One minor note here...
WOODY Andy's birthday party's been moved to today.
WOODY Next we have --
The toys all PANIC.
REX What?!
REX Whadda ya mean, the party's today?!
REX His birthday's not 'til next week!!
HAMM What's going on down there?
HAMM Is Mom losing her marbles?!
WOODY Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.
WOODY I'm not worried.
WOODY You shouldn't be worried.
MR. POTATO HEAD Of course Woody ain't worried!
MR. POTATO HEAD He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
SLINKY Hey, hey!
SLINKY Come on, Potato Head!
SLINKY If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darnit, it's good enough for me.
SLINKY Woody has never steered us wrong before.
While Slinky speaks, Potato Head takes off his mouth and mimes kissing his own butt.
WOODY C'mon, guys!
WOODY Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
REX But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?
REX A mean one?
REX I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
WOODY Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.
WOODY This is Andy we're talking about.
Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.
WOODY It doesn't matter how much we're played with.
WOODY What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.
WOODY That's what we're made for.
WOODY Right?
Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
HAMM Pardon me.
HAMM I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE!
HAMM Birthday guests at three o'clock!
WOODY Stay calm, everyone!!
Too late.
The toys PANIC and stampede over Woody towards the bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor.
WOODY Uh, meeting adjourned.
The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to get a peek outside.
HAMM Oh, boy.
HAMM Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
MR. POTATO HEAD I can't see a thing!
Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes out of his head and holds them up over the other toys.
CHILDREN file towards the front door carrying presents.
HAMM Yessir, we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure.
REX Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
HAMM Ah, for crying out loud, they're all in boxes, you idiot!
The presents keep coming.
REX They're getting bigger.
SLINKY Wait!
SLINKY There's a nice little one over there!
At first, the kid's present appears to be a little box, but then the kid turns -- the present is four feet long.
The toys SCREAM.
MR. SPELL Spell the word "trashcan."
REX We're doomed!
Down on the floor, Woody smacks his hand to his forehead in surrender.
WOODY Alright!
WOODY Alright!
The toys turn inside and look down at Woody.
WOODY If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
REX Yes!
REX Yes!
REX We promise!
WOODY Okay, save your batteries!
HAMM Eh, very good, Woody.
HAMM That's using the old noodle.
Woody jumps up onto Andy's bed and turns to the Sargent on the nightstand.
WOODY Sargent.
WOODY Establish a recon post downstairs.
WOODY Code red.
WOODY You know what to do.
SARGENT Yes SIR!
The green army man hops down to the floor where a "BUCKET O' SOLDIERS" sits.
SARGENT Alright men, you heard him.
SARGENT Code Red!
SARGENT Repeat: We are at Code Red!
SARGENT Recon plan Charlie.
SARGENT Execute!
SARGENT Let's move move move!!
THE GREEN ARMY MEN file out of the bucket and march in formation across the bedroom floor.
Andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth to make sure the coast is clear.
Satisfied, he motions for the others to proceed.
Squads of soldiers march into the hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope.
The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and hold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scene below through his binoculars.
Directly below, Mrs. Davis passes through the hallway rounding up Andy and all his birthday guests.
MRS. DAVIS Okay, c'mon kids!
MRS. DAVIS Everyone in the living room.
MRS. DAVIS It's almost time for the presents.
Once Mrs. Davis and the children are out of sight, the Sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal.
TWO PARATROOPERS jump out through the railing, parachuting down to the floor below.
The paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles, then give the "all clear" sign.
The jump rope is lowered, and more soldiers rappel down.
The toys race towards the nightstand where Woody has placed the receiving half of the baby monitor.
WOODY And this --
WOODY -- is how we find out what is in those presents.
The green army men march in formation across the floor when suddenly...
Can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen door.
Immediately the Sargent signals for his men to freeze in their various classic action poses.
MRS. DAVIS Okay, who's hungry?
MRS. DAVIS Here come the chips.
MRS. DAVIS I've got Cool Ranch and Barbeque --
The door opens and Mrs. Davis' foot comes down hard on top of a soldier.
MRS. DAVIS Owww!
MRS. DAVIS What in the world -- ?
MRS. DAVIS Oh, I thought I told him to pick these up.
With a sweep of her foot, she brushes the army men out of her path and continues on to the living room.
REX Shouldn't they be there by now?
REX What's taking them so long?!
WOODY Hey, these guys are professionals.
WOODY They're the best.
WOODY C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men to proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the living room.
The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to drag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs. Davis' foot.
The Sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet.
WOUNDED SOLDIER Go on without me.
WOUNDED SOLDIER Just go!
SLINKY A good soldier never leaves a man behind.
The Sargent motions to the remaining men above.
They lower themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor.
Once downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the houseplant.
Suddenly...
A BALL bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps and kid clamor.
The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant, right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor.
They conceal themselves in the house plant just before the children run by.
While the baby monitor is set in place, A MEDIC evaluates the wounded soldier and gives the "thumb's up" signal.
The Sargent scans the party with his binoculars.
The pile of brightly wrapped gifts sits atop the living room coffee table.
SARGENT There they are.
The toys perk up as STATIC suddenly emits from the baby monitor.
SARGENT Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
WOODY This is it!
WOODY This is it!
WOODY Quiet, quiet, quiet!
SARGENT Come in, Mother Bird.
SARGENT Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
MR. POTATO HEAD Mrs. Potato Head...Mrs.
MR. POTATO HEAD Potato Head...Mrs.
MR. POTATO HEAD Potato Head...
MR. POTATO HEAD Hey, I can dream, can't I?
SARGENT The bow's coming off...he's ripping the wrapping paper...it's a...it's...it's a lunchbox!
SARGENT We've got a lunchbox, here!
WOODY A lunchbox?!
MR. POTATO HEAD A lunchbox...?!
SLINKY For lunch.
SLINKY Heh heh heh...
SARGENT Ok, second present...it appears to be...okay, it's bed sheets.
MR. POTATO HEAD Who invited THAT kid?!
DAVIS Oh, only one left.
SARGENT Okay, we're on the last present now...
WOODY Last present!
SARGENT It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!
SARGENT Repeat!
SARGENT Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
The toys CHEER WITH RELIEF.
HAMM Yeah, alright!!
Hamm gives Potato Head a congratulatory pat on the back, sending his facial features flying.
MR. POTATO HEAD Hey, watch it!
HAMM Sorry there, old Spudhead.
SARGENT Mission accomplished.
SARGENT Well done, men.
SARGENT Pack it up, we're going home.
WOODY So did I tell ya?
WOODY Huh?
WOODY Nothing to worry about.
SLINKY I knew you were right all along, Woody.
SLINKY Never doubted you for a second.
The platoon is preparing to exit the plant when...
MRS. DAVIS Wait a minute.
MRS. DAVIS Oooh, what do we have here?!
The Sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes.
Mrs. Davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling out another large present.
SARGENT Wait -- turn that thing back on!
SARGENT Come in, Mother Bird, come in, Mother Bird.
All the toys tense up.
SARGENT Mom has pulled a surprise present from the closet.
SARGENT Andy's opening it...
SARGENT He's really excited about this one.
SARGENT It's a huge package.
SARGENT Oh -- get out -- one of the kids is in the way, I can't see...
SARGENT ...it's...it's a --
The sound of children CHEERING emits from the monitor, cutting off the Sargent.
REX It's a WHAT?!
REX WHAT IS IT?!!!
Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making the monitor drop to the floor.
The impact causes the batteries to roll out.
REX Oh, no!
MR. POTATO HEAD Oh, ya big lizard!
MR. POTATO HEAD Now we'll never know what it is!
HAMM Way to go, Rex.
Everyone rushes to the fallen monitor.
Potato Head tries to correctly insert the batteries.
WOODY No, no!
WOODY Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
HAMM Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
WOODY Plus is positive, minus is negative!
WOODY Oh, let me!
Woody jumps down off the bed and shoves both Hamm and Potato Head aside.
ANDY Let's go to my room, guys!
The kids rush past the houseplant.
Woody puts the last battery back in.
WOODY There.
SARGENT Juvenile intrusion!
SARGENT Repeat!
SARGENT Resume your positions NOW!
WOODY Andy's coming, everybody!
WOODY Back to your places.
WOODY Hurry!
The toys PANIC and scatter about the room.
MR. POTATO HEAD Where's my ear?
MR. POTATO HEAD Who's seen my ear?
MR. POTATO HEAD Did you see my ear?
REX Outta my way!
REX Here I come, here I come --
Frantic, Rex slams into a trashcan and falls over.
Everyone scurries to their places as the KIDS' FOOTSTEPS grow louder.
Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as...
Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children's feet rush in.
FRIEND #1 Hey, look!
FRIEND #1 His lasers light up.
ANDY Take that, Zurg!
Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, down the gap between the bed and the back wall.
FRIEND #2 Quick!
FRIEND #2 Make a space!
FRIEND #2 This is where the spaceship lands.
ANDY -- and you press his back and he does a karate-chop action!
MRS. DAVIS Come on down, guys.
MRS. DAVIS It's time for games!
MRS. DAVIS We've got prizes!
ANDY Oh, yeah!
The kids all run out as fast as they entered, SLAMMING THE DOOR behind them.
The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed.
MR. POTATO HEAD What is it?
BO PEEP Can you see it?
SLINKY What the heck is up there?
REX Woody?
REX Who's up there with you?
Woody crawls out from under the bed.
The toys are shocked to discover him there.
SLINKY Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
WOODY Uh-h-h-h...nothing!
WOODY Uh, nothing.
WOODY I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.
WOODY Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.
WOODY It's just a mistake.
MR. POTATO HEAD Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
REX Have you been replaced?
WOODY Hey!
WOODY What did I tell you earlier?
WOODY No one is getting replaced.
The toys give each other a look of doubt.
WOODY Now let's all be polite, and give whatever it is up there a nice, big "Andy's Room" welcome.
Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the edge.
His eyes widen at the sight of...
We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head to toe.
The imposing "G.I.
Joe-sized" doll stands heroically in the center of the bed, his back to Woody.
Woody GULPS.
Buzz comes alive and looks around.
While he scans the bedroom a "DARTH VADER" LIKE BREATHING is heard.
Buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest.
BUZZ Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
BUZZ Come in, Star Command.
Nothing.
He pushes the button again.
BUZZ Star Command - come in.
BUZZ Do you read me?
BUZZ Why don't they answer?!!
Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging.
The box is designed to look like a spaceship.
BUZZ My ship!!
He runs up to the box and investigates the damage.
BUZZ Blast!
BUZZ This'll take weeks to repair!
Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- his wrist communicator.
BUZZ Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.
BUZZ Stardate 4072: My ship has run off course en route to sector 12.
BUZZ I've crash landed on a strange planet.
BUZZ The impact must have awoken me from hyper-sleep.
Buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed.
BUZZ Terrain seems a bit unstable...
He taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator.
BUZZ No read-out yet if the air is breathable...
BUZZ and there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere --
Woody's face suddenly pops into view.
WOODY Hello-o-o...
Buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance.
He presses a button on his arm that turns on a red "laser beam" light on his wrist.
Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead and holds it there.
WOODY Aaaaaaah!
WOODY Whoa, hey, whoa, did I frighten you?
WOODY Didn't mean to.
WOODY Sorry.
WOODY Howdy!
WOODY My name is Woody and this is Andy's room.
WOODY That's all I wanted to say, and also, there has been a bit of a mix-up.
WOODY This is my spot, see, the bed here --
While Woody is speaking, Buzz notices the sheriff's badge on Woody's vest.
BUZZ Local law enforcement!
BUZZ It's about time you got here.
BUZZ I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit.
BUZZ My ship has crash landed here by mistake.
Buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation.
Woody tries to keep up.
WOODY Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
BUZZ I need to repair my turbo boosters.
BUZZ Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
WOODY Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
BUZZ Watch yourself!!
Buzz shoves Woody down on the bed and re-activates his wrist laser.
BUZZ Halt!
BUZZ Who goes there?!
The other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed.
REX Don't shoot!
REX It's okay!
REX Friends!
BUZZ Do you know these life forms?
WOODY Yes.
WOODY They're Andy's toys.
BUZZ Alright, everyone.
BUZZ You're clear to come up.
Buzz walks over to the toys.
BUZZ I am Buzz Lightyear.
BUZZ I come in peace.
Rex steps forward and eagerly shakes Buzz's hand.
REX Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!
BUZZ Why, thank you...
BUZZ Now thank you all for your kind welcome.
REX Say!
REX What's that button do?
BUZZ I'll show you.
Buzz presses a button on his chest.
BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE) Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
The toys all GASP IN AWE.
SLINKY Hey, Woody's got something like that.
SLINKY His is a pullstring, only it --
MR. POTATO HEAD Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
HAMM Oh yeah, but not like this one.
HAMM This is a quality sound system.
HAMM Probably all copper wiring, huh?
HAMM So, uh, where are you from?
HAMM Singapore?
HAMM Hong Kong?
BUZZ Well...no, actually I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4.
BUZZ As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.
As Buzz speaks, Woody glances down at the box in which Buzz arrived.
There is a cartoon drawing of Buzz giving the exact, word- for-word spiel that Buzz is now giving.
MR. POTATO HEAD Oh, really?
MR. POTATO HEAD I'm from Playskool.
REX And I'm from Mattel.
REX Well, I'm not actually from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out.
REX Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Woody walks over to Bo Peep.
WOODY You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
BO PEEP Well sure, look at him.
BO PEEP He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
Slinky presses the button on Buzz's arm, activating his laser light.
Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.
BUZZ Ah, ah, ah, please be careful!
BUZZ You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
MR. POTATO HEAD Hey, a laser!
MR. POTATO HEAD How come you don't have a laser, Woody?
WOODY It's not a laser!
WOODY It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
HAMM What's with him?
MR. POTATO HEAD Laser-envy.
WOODY All right, that's enough.
WOODY Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
BUZZ Toy?
WOODY T-O-Y.
WOODY Toy.
BUZZ Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
WOODY The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
MR. POTATO HEAD Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
REX Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?
REX Now I'm curious.
REX What does a Space Ranger actually do?
WOODY He's not a Space Ranger!
WOODY He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
BUZZ Excuse me.
Buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out.
Again the toys GASP IN AWE.
HAMM Oh, impressive wingspan.
HAMM Very good!
WOODY Oh, what?!...What?!
WOODY These are plastic.
WOODY He can't fly!
BUZZ They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
WOODY No, you can't.
BUZZ Yes, I can.
WOODY You can't!
BUZZ Can!
WOODY Can't!
WOODY Can't!
WOODY Can't!
BUZZ I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
WOODY Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!
WOODY Prove it.
BUZZ All right, then, I will.
BUZZ Stand back everyone!
The crowd of toys make room for Buzz as he heads towards the edge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost.
He poses like a high diver, shuts his eyes...
BUZZ To infinity and beyond!!
...and leaps off the bed.
Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball and bounces right back up.
He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down the track, through the loop, and off a ramp.
Buzz soars upward into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling.
Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels.
The impact turns on the PLANE'S MOTOR making it (and Buzz) spin around and around.
All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized.
Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate from the plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed.
Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody and then opens his eyes.
BUZZ Can.
The crowd of toys rush Buzz, CHEERING AND CLAPPING WITH
REX Whoa!
REX Oh, wow!
REX You flew magnificently!
BO PEEP I found my moving buddy!
BUZZ Why, thank you.
BUZZ Thank you all.
BUZZ Thank you.
WOODY That wasn't flying!
WOODY That was falling with style!
MR. POTATO HEAD Man, the dolls must really go for you!
MR. POTATO HEAD Can you teach me that?
Woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming.
Slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches Woody.
SLINKY Heh, heh, heh!
SLINKY Golly bob howdy --
WOODY Oh, shut up!
WOODY In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.
WOODY They'll see...
WOODY they'll see.
WOODY I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
SONG: STRANGE THINGS plays over montage.
A) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed, running around the room.
B) Andy sets Woody down on the floor.
Next he "lands" Buzz Lightyear on the floor opposite Woody.
Andy shoots Buzz's laser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if he'd been blown away by the laser.
C) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and cowboy pajamas.
Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas and a homemade spaceman's helmet.
ANDY Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
D) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom transform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the wall, the pillow, the bedspread.
E) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR.
The space ranger suggests a few tips for the dinosaur.
Rex tries again, this time giving a "JURASSIC PARK" ROAR.
The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.
F) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of Buzz.
Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's hair, chatting away like a hair dresser.
Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.
G) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys as weights.
Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot, using his feet as a treadmill.
Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends up tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the barbell.
H) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the checkerboard.
Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and Robot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's "ship" up on top of ABC blocks for repair.
In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the pieces flying.
One of the checkers ricochets off the dresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.
I) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is stretched over to the other side where Woody sits.
Slinky's wagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.
Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his front end no choice but to eventually follow.
J) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until just Woody and Buzz are left.
He deliberates as to which toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox.
Andy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers next to him.
Woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks back into the box, closing the lid to...
The black screen splits horizontally to become...
All is clear -- no sign of Andy.
Woody throws open the lid of the toy box.
WOODY Finally!
He takes a couple DEEP BREATHS of fresh air, then discovers that his hat is missing.
WOODY Hey!
WOODY Who's got my hat?
The rubber shark pops up wearing Woody's cowboy hat.
SHARK Look, I'm Woody.
SHARK Howdy, howdy, howdy!
WOODY Ah-hah!
WOODY Ah-hah-hah!
WOODY Give me that!
Woody leaps out of the toy box.
BUZZ Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog.
BUZZ Let me show you something.
BUZZ It looks as though I've been accepted into your culture.
Woody looks up to see Buzz chatting with Rex and Slinky.
BUZZ Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me.
Buzz puts his foot out so that Slinky and Rex can see the sole of his boot.
The name "ANDY" is written on it in permanent marker.
SLINKY & REX Wow!
REX With permanent ink, too!
BUZZ Well, I must get back to repairing my ship.
Buzz walks away.
Woody looks at HIS foot -- "Andy" is written on it also but in a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded.
BO PEEP Don't let it get to you, Woody.
Hearing Bo, Woody puts his foot back down and quickly straightens up.
WOODY Uh, let what?
WOODY I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?
WOODY Who?
BO PEEP I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
MR. POTATO HEAD Yeah.
MR. POTATO HEAD Like the attic.
MR. POTATO HEAD Heh, heh...
WOODY Alright!
WOODY That's it!
Woody angrily marches across the room.
Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the ABC blocks.
Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under the ship like a mechanic.
Snake and Robot stand by waiting for instructions.
Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.
BUZZ Unidirectional bonding strip.
Robot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tape dispenser.
ROBOT Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!
Snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth.
Woody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of Buzz's foot and rolls him out from under the ship.
WOODY Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.
WOODY He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
BUZZ What are you talking about?
BUZZ Where's that bonding strip?!
Buzz rolls himself back under.
Woody rolls him out again.
WOODY And another thing.
WOODY Stop with this spaceman thing.
WOODY It's getting on my nerves.
BUZZ Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command?
WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Buzz stands up, face to face with Woody.
BUZZ Don't even think about it, cowboy!
WOODY Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Woody pushes Buzz in the chest, accidentally activating a button that makes the spaceman's helmet open.
Buzz grabs his neck, GASPING FOR AIR.
He drops to his knees and begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath.
Woody is unsure how to react.
Suddenly, Buzz SNIFFS the air.
BUZZ The air isn't toxic.
Buzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody.
BUZZ How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet!
BUZZ My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!
Buzz closes his helmet.
WOODY You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!
WOODY Hey, guys!
WOODY Look!
WOODY It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
BUZZ You're mocking me, aren't you?
WOODY Oh, no, no, no...
WOODY Buzz, look!
WOODY An alien!
BUZZ Where?
Buzz falls for the trick and turns around.
Woody kneels over with LAUGHTER.
Woody stops short.
All the toys look to the bedroom window.
SID Yessss!
SID Ah, ha, ha, ha...
WOODY Uh-oh.
Slinky hides under the bed.
SLINKY It's Sid!
REX I thought he was at summer camp!
HAMM They must have kicked him out early this year.
The toys rush over to the window.
REX Oh, no!
REX Not Sid!
SID ...Incoming!
From out the window, SID PHILLIPS, a hyperactive ten-year- old, and his dog, SCUD, can be roughly made out jumping around in their backyard.
A tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard.
Sid pummels the figure with rocks while Scud strains at his leash, barking wildly.
MR. POTATO HEAD Who is it this time?
WOODY I can't tell.
WOODY Hey, where's Lenny?
LENNY Right here, Woody.
Woody turns to see, LENNY, a pair of wind-up binoculars, approaching him from the other end of the desk.
Woody picks Lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene.
REX Oh, no.
REX I can't bear to watch one of these again!
A full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in the center of the backyard.
A huge M-80 is strapped to the doll's back with masking tape.
WOODY Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
SID Just stay where you are, Corporal!
SID Don't move, Carl.
SID You'll blow up.
SID I know you're tired!
SID I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move.
SID Do you hear me?
Buzz breaks through the crowd.
BUZZ What's going on?
WOODY Nothing that concerns you spacemen.
WOODY Just us TOYS.
BUZZ I'd better take a look anyway.
Buzz grabs Lenny from Woody and looks through him.
BUZZ Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
WOODY That's why.
WOODY Sid.
BUZZ Sure is a hairy fellah.
WOODY No!
WOODY No, that's Scud, you idiot!
Again, Woody readjusts Buzz's view.
He is sporting a skull t-shirt and LAUGHING HIDEOUSLY.
WOODY THAT is Sid!
BUZZ You mean that happy child?
MR. POTATO HEAD That ain't no happy child.
REX He tortures toys -- just for fun.
BUZZ Well, then we've got to do something!
Buzz steps up onto the window ledge.
The toys GASP IN SHOCK.
BO PEEP What are you doing?!!
BO PEEP Get down from there!
BUZZ I'm going to go teach that boy a lesson.
WOODY Yeah, sure.
WOODY You go ahead.
WOODY Melt him with your scary laser.
Woody presses Buzz's laser button.
It emits a WIMPY ELECTRONIC BEEP.
Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.
BUZZ Be careful with that, it's extremely dangerous.
While Woody and Buzz banter, Lenny witnesses Sid lighting the fuse of the M80.
LENNY He's lighting it!
LENNY He's lighting it!
LENNY Hit the dirt!
The toys jump away from the window.
Dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of Andy's house.
SID Yes!
SID He's gone!
SID He's history!
Andy's toys peek over the window sill.
A large black scorch mark is all that remains where Combat Carl once stood.
Sid jumps up and down victoriously while Scud resumes his BARKING.
BUZZ I could have stopped him.
WOODY Buzz, I would love to see you try.
WOODY 'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Sid CACKLES and dances around the crater.
BO PEEP The sooner we move the better.
A "FOR SALE" real estate sign stands in the front yard.
Another sign reading "SOLD" hangs from the bottom.
Mom opens the door to Andy's room and steps in.
The room is full of packing boxes, most of them half full.
Andy is playing with Woody and Buzz.
ANDY To infinity and beyond!
MRS. DAVIS Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.
MRS. DAVIS What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
ANDY Pizza Planet?!
ANDY Oh, cool!
Andy throws the two toys on his desk with Buzz landing right on top of Woody.
MRS. DAVIS Go wash your hands and I'll get Molly ready.
The minute the door is closed Woody comes alive and shoves Buzz off of him.
ANDY Can I bring some toys?
MRS. DAVIS You can bring ONE toy...
ANDY Just one?
Woody perks up with concern.
WOODY One toy?
He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking away towards the opposite end of the desk.
Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk.
With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball.
WOODY Will Andy pick me?
He tips the 8 ball over.
The triangular oracle floats up to the surface.
Its prediction reads: DON'T COUNT ON IT.
WOODY Don't count on it?!!
WOODY Doh-h-h-h!
Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust.
It rolls across the desk and falls behind it with a LOUD THUD.
Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk and peers down it.
The 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom.
The space is a black chasm, dark and deep, just big enough to fit...a toy.
Woody looks across the desk at Buzz.
He is HUMMING TO HIMSELF as he forages through Andy's pen/pencil tray looking for "tools" to repair his ship with.
Right behind Buzz sits
It rests on the desktop, pointing in the direction where the 8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side.
Woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to Buzz.
WOODY Buzz!!
WOODY Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!!
WOODY Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!
WOODY We've got trouble!
BUZZ Trouble?!
BUZZ Where?!
WOODY Down there.
WOODY Just down there.
WOODY A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
BUZZ Then we've no time to lose!!
Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk.
BUZZ I don't see anything!
Woody picks up the remote for the RC Car and switches it on.
RC's eyes (headlights) open sleepily.
WOODY Oh, he's there.
WOODY Just, just keep looking.
Woody hits the "FORWARD" button on the remote and steers the RC Car straight for Buzz.
BUZZ What kind of a toy -- ?
Buzz turns to see RC headed straight for him.
He dives out of the way as the RC Car SMASHES into the base of...
The impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board.
Buzz ducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desk like arrows.
POTATO HEAD sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm.
He looks up at the desk and GASPS as the bulletin board slams down onto...
A GLOBE knocking it out of its stand.
The globe starts rolling right at Buzz.
Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created.
Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind him, Indiana Jones style.
Buzz gets stuck "log rolling" on a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the way onto the window ledge.
The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-style desklamp.
The arm of the lamp swings all the way around, barely missing Woody...
...and knocks Buzz out the window.
WOODY Buzz!!!
Woody looks out the window.
No sign of Buzz.
All the other toys rush over to the sill.
SLINKY I don't see him in the driveway!
SLINKY I think he bounced into Sid's yard.
Woody backs away from the COMMOTION, unnoticed.
REX Buzz!
RC CAR Whirrr!!
RC CAR Whirrrr-whirrrr!!!
Rex looks over at RC.
The remote control car is bouncing up and down excitedly.
REX Hey everyone!
REX RC's trying to say something!
The toys turn from the window to RC.
REX What is it, boy?
RC CAR Whirrr!!!
RC CAR Whirrr!
RC CAR Whirrrrrr!!
MR. POTATO HEAD He's sayin' that this was no accident.
TOYS Huh?
BO PEEP What do you mean?
MR. POTATO HEAD I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed...
MR. POTATO HEAD ...by Woody.
The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks.
WOODY Wait a minute.
WOODY You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
MR. POTATO HEAD That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
WOODY Now, it was an accident!
WOODY Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
SLINKY We believe you, Woody.
SLINKY Right, Rex?
REX Oh, I don't like confrontations.
The Sargent pops out of the army bucket next to Woody.
SARGENT Where is your honor, dirtbag?!
SARGENT You are an absolute disgrace!
SARGENT You don't deserve to --
Woody seals the lid back on the bucket.
Potato Head starts closing in on Woody.
MR. POTATO HEAD Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on your playtime, could ya Woody?
MR. POTATO HEAD Didn't want to face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy, so you got rid of him.
MR. POTATO HEAD Well, what if Andy starts playin' with me more, Woody, huh?
MR. POTATO HEAD You gonna knock me outta the window, too?
Potato Head has driven Woody back to the very edge of the desk -- trapped.
HAMM I don't think we should give him the chance.
Suddenly, the lid pops off the bucket of army men.
SARGENT There he is, men!
SARGENT Frag him!
The army men yell CHARGE and pounce on Woody, while all the rest of the toys close in.
MR. POTATO HEAD Let's string him up by his pull- string!
HAMM I got dibs on his hat!
BO PEEP Would you boys stop it?!
HAMM Tackle him!
WOODY No, no, no, no!
WOODY Wait!
WOODY Wait I can explain everything --
MRS. DAVIS Andy, c'mon!
ANDY Okay, Mom, be right down.
ANDY I've got to get Buzz.
SARGENT Retreat!
The toys all drop Woody and rush back to their places.
Andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where Woody is lying.
Andy overlooks Woody and begins searching around the room.
ANDY Mom!
ANDY Do you know where Buzz is?
MRS. DAVIS No, I haven't seen him.
Woody painfully watches as Andy searches in vain for Buzz.
MR. POTATO HEAD Psssst!
Woody looks across the room.
Potato Head and Etch-A-Sketch peek out of a packing box.
Etch-A-Sketch scribbles a hangman's noose while Potato Head points an accusing finger in Woody's direction.
Woody GULPS.
MRS. DAVIS Andy!
MRS. DAVIS I'm heading out the door.
ANDY But Mom, I can't find him!
MRS. DAVIS Well, honey, just grab some other toy!
MRS. DAVIS Now c'mon!
ANDY Okay...
He grabs Woody and walks out of the room.
Andy exits the house dragging Woody as he heads toward the family van in the driveway.
ANDY I couldn't find my Buzz.
ANDY I know I left him right there.
MRS. DAVIS Honey, I'm sure he's around.
MRS. DAVIS You'll find him.
A BUSH next to the van begins to rustle.
Hands part the foliage, revealing Buzz.
He eyes Woody going into the van and does a slow burn.
The van ENGINE STARTS UP.
Buzz races out of the bush, and with a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as it pulls out of the driveway.
A chain of monkeys falls into view, dangling a considerable distance above the ground.
The rest of Andy's toys have regrouped at the window, supervising the lowering of the "monkey chain."
SLINKY It's too short!
SLINKY We need more monkeys!
REX There aren't any more!
REX That's the whole barrel.
Rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge.
REX Buzz!
REX The monkeys aren't working!
REX We're formulating another plan!
REX Stay calm!
REX Oh, where could he be?
The Davis' family van pulls up to one of the pumps.
Andy sits in the rear seat with Woody lying next to him.
ANDY Can I help pump the gas?
MRS. DAVIS Sure!
MRS. DAVIS I'll even let you drive.
Both Mrs. Davis and Andy exit the van while baby Molly sleeps up front in her car seat.
ANDY Yeah?!
MRS. DAVIS Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
ANDY Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
With Mom and Andy out of range, Woody comes to life.
He stares out the sun roof, still reeling from everything.
WOODY Oh, great.
WOODY How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?
Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof.
WOODY Buzz!
Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody.
He is furious.
WOODY Buzz!
WOODY You're alive!
WOODY This is great!
WOODY Oh, I'm saved!
WOODY I'm saved!
WOODY Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake.
WOODY Huh?
No response from Buzz.
Just an angry stare.
WOODY Right?
WOODY Buddy?
BUZZ I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
WOODY Oh.
WOODY Oh, that's good.
BUZZ But we're not on my planet, are we?
WOODY No.
Buzz lunges for Woody.
The two toys fly off the seat and out the open side door of the van.
Woody and Buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, locked in mortal combat.
WOODY Ok!
WOODY Come on!
WOODY You want a piece of me?!
Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around.
Woody lunges with all his might.
He smacks Buzz in the face, making it SQUEAK with every blow.
Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand.
WOODY Owwwww!!!
Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activating BUZZ'S SAMPLED VOICE buttons.
The toys stop fighting.
Before they can react...
MRS. DAVIS Next stop...
ANDY Pizza Planet!
ANDY Yeah!!!
The van drives off.
WOODY Andy?!
Woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it drives out of sight, leaving Buzz and Woody stranded.
WOODY Doesn't he realize that I'm not there?
WOODY I'm LOST!
WOODY Oh, I'm a lost toy!
Meanwhile, Buzz checks the surroundings.
He flips open his wrist communicator.
BUZZ Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.
BUZZ The local Sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort --
Woody whips around, his expression changing from panic to seething anger.
He charges at Buzz.
WOODY You!
Just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station.
Buzz dives off to the side while Woody collapses right where he stands on the pavement.
The truck ROARS over him.
A GIGANTIC TIRE stops just millimeters from Woody's nose.
Petrified, Woody inches away from the tire, moving back under the truck until he bumps into Buzz.
BUZZ According to my nava-computer, the --
WOODY Shut up!
WOODY Just shut up, you idiot!!
BUZZ Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
WOODY This is the perfect time to panic!
WOODY I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
BUZZ My fault?!
BUZZ If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
WOODY Oh, yeah?
WOODY Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
BUZZ Don't talk to me about importance.
BUZZ Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
WOODY WHAT?!!
WOODY What are you talking about?!
Buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to the stars.
BUZZ Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet.
BUZZ I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness.
BUZZ And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendez-vous with Star Command.
Woody explodes.
WOODY YOU ARE A TOY!!!
WOODY You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear, you're an action figure!!
WOODY You are a child's plaything!!!
Beat.
BUZZ You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity.
BUZZ Farewell.
Buzz walks off.
WOODY Oh, yeah?
WOODY Well, good riddance, ya looney!
Woody walks away in the opposite direction.
WOODY Rendez-vous with Star Command.
PIZZA DELIVERER Hey, Gas Dude!
ATTENDANT You talkin' to me?
PIZZA DELIVERER Yeah, man, can you help me?
PIZZA DELIVERER Do you know where Cutting Blvd.
PIZZA DELIVERER is?
ATTENDANT Just a moment...
Woody looks in the direction of the bell.
His face lights up at the sight of...
WOODY Pizza Planet...Andy!
Woody takes a step forward and then stops.
WOODY Oh, no!
WOODY I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
Woody runs back under the tanker truck.
Buzz is at the far end of the truck, walking away from Woody.
WOODY Buzz!
WOODY Buzz, come back!
BUZZ Go away.
Woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation and then eyes...
Atop the truck is a rocket with the Pizza Planet logo.
WOODY No, Buzz, you've gotta come back.
WOODY I found a spaceship!
Buzz stops walking away and looks back at Woody.
WOODY It's a spaceship, Buzz!
The delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off.
PIZZA DELIVERER C'mon, man, hurry up.
PIZZA DELIVERER Um, like the pizza's are getting cold here.
Woody and Buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within the safety of a nearby oilcan display.
BUZZ Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
WOODY Uh-huh.
WOODY And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
BUZZ Well, then let's climb abroad.
Buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of the pizza truck.
Woody chases after him.
WOODY No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.
WOODY No one will see us there.
BUZZ Negative.
BUZZ There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.
BUZZ We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
In a flash, Buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rear view mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab.
WOODY Yeah, but, Buzz!
WOODY Buzz!
PIZZA DELIVERER Ok, so that's two lefts, and then a right, huh?
ATTENDANT Yeah.
PIZZA DELIVERER Okay, thanks for the directions.
WOODY Buzz!
Woody runs around to the back of the truck, scrambles up the bumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside.
Woody lets out a YELL, as the back hatch slams back down on his rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck.
Woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab.
Buzz is hidden from THE PIZZA DRIVER's view by a stack of pizzas in their insulated covers.
Buzz prudently fastens his safety belt.
WOODY It'll be safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay.
WOODY What an idiot!
The driver shifts into gear and hits the gas, propelling Woody to the back of the truck.
The pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turns and hills at high speeds.
Woody is helplessly thrown around the truck.
With every blow, Woody YELPS in pain.
The truck climbs a steep hill.
Woody looks up just in time to see...
A LARGE TOOL BOX barreling towards him.
We MOVE DOWN to reveal...
The delivery truck barrels into the parking lot and parks.
After the driver leaves the truck, Buzz peeks out from the passenger window.
Two imposing animatronic robots guard the doorway.
As CUSTOMERS approach the front, the guards part their crossed "pizza spears," allowing the patrons to enter.
ROBOT GUARDS You are clear to enter.
ROBOT GUARDS Welcome to Pizza Planet.
VARIOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS blare out from speakers:
MALE VOICE OVER SPEAKER Next shuttle lift-off scheduled for T-minus 30 minutes and counting...
FEMALE VOICE OVER SPEAKER The white zone is for eating pizza only.
FEMALE VOICE OVER SPEAKER The white zone is for...
Excited, Buzz pries open the window between the cab and truck bed.
BUZZ Sheriff!
Woody is gone.
Just the toolbox and strewn trash.
BUZZ Sheriff?
The toolbox falls on its side revealing Woody.
He peels off the back of the truck and falls into a pile of trash.
BUZZ There you are.
BUZZ Now the entrance is heavily guarded.
BUZZ We need a way to get inside.
Woody rises from the trash with a "MEGA-GULP" cup on his head.
BUZZ Great idea, Woody!
BUZZ I like your thinking!
In the f.g.
sits a trashcan with fast food containers littered around it.
MORE CUSTOMERS approach the "guarded" entrance.
ROBOT GUARDS You are clear to enter.
ROBOT GUARDS Welcome to Pizza Planet.
The front doors automatically swing open as the people pass through.
Suddenly two pieces of trash -- a burger container and "MEGA-GULP" cup stand up.
The two disguised toys make a dash through the closing doors.
BUZZ Quickly, Sheriff!
BUZZ The airlock is closing.
Woody and Buzz just make it inside but then freeze immediately as a GROUP OF KIDS run past, forcing the toys to pose as discarded trash.
Once the coast is clear, Woody and Buzz resume walking.
Buzz bumps into Woody.
WOODY Ow!
WOODY Watch where you're going!
BUZZ Sorry.
They sneak in between two long rows of video games and throw off their disguises.
They then take a good look at...
The space-themed arena is filled with hordes of children playing video games.
A sea of HI-TECH SOUNDS and lights overwhelm the place.
Buzz is beaming with hope.
BUZZ What a space port.
BUZZ Good work, Woody.
Woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade, but none of the kids look familiar to him.
Just then he HEARS...
ANDY Mom, can I play Black Hole?
ANDY Please, please, please?!
Woody turns around and through the video games he spots...
ANDY standing with Mom and Molly in her stroller.
WOODY Andy!
MRS. DAVIS What's Black Hole?
ANDY Oh, it's so cool...
The family begins to walk away.
BUZZ Now we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 12 --
Buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction when Woody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor.
WOODY Wait a minute!
WOODY No Buzz!
WOODY This way!
WOODY There's a special ship.
WOODY I just saw it!
BUZZ You mean it has hyperdrive?
WOODY Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
The toys manage to get ahead of Andy.
Woody peeks around the corner of one of the video games and waits for Mom and Andy to approach.
WOODY C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
BUZZ Where is it?
BUZZ I don't see the --
Buzz stops short at the sight of...
It is modeled to look like a spaceship ready to launch.
BUZZ Spaceship.
WOODY Alright Buzz, get ready...
Buzz heads for the crane game, but Woody does not notice, his eyes locked on the approaching stroller.
WOODY Okay, Buzz, when I say "go," we're gonna jump in the basket --
Woody turns and realizes Buzz is gone.
He looks across the way just in time to see Buzz leap into the crane game through the "PRIZE" slot.
WOODY Buzz!
Woody turns back in the direction of the stroller.
It has already gone past.
WOODY Dooh!
WOODY No!
WOODY This cannot be happening to me!!
Woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to hold back for a moment as some SCREAMING children pass by.
Buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slot from the prize toys and leaps into a pile of...
There are hundreds of them, all identical and way too cute.
ALIEN #1 A stranger!
ALIEN #2 From the outside!
ALIENS Oo-o-o-o-o-o...
BUZZ Greetings!
BUZZ I am Buzz Lightyear!
BUZZ I come in peace!
ALIENS Tell us!
ALIENS What is it like outside?
The squeeze toys rush Buzz like JABBERING excited children.
With the kids gone, Woody crosses the aisle to the crane game and dives through the prize slot.
Woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot.
BUZZ This is an intergalactic emergency!
BUZZ I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12!
Woody peeks over the partition to witness Buzz surround by the cute alien toys.
BUZZ Who's in charge here?
All the aliens point upward.
ALIENS The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!
Woody and Buzz look up.
It dangles directly above the toys.
ALIEN #1 The claw is our master.
ALIEN #2 The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.
WOODY This is ludicrous.
Woody GASPS at the recognition of Sid's voice.
He turns to see Sid heading straight for the crane game.
WOODY Oh, no!
WOODY Sid!!!
Woody leaps off the partition and tackles Buzz, pushing the two of them deep into the pile of aliens.
WOODY Get down!!
Sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his pants pocket.
BUZZ What's gotten into you, Sheriff?
BUZZ I was --
WOODY YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
ALIEN #4 Sh-h-h-h-h-h.
ALIEN #4 The claw.
ALIEN #4 It moves.
It moves into position and hovers directly above the area where Woody and Buzz are hiding.
The crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is right on top of Buzz.
ALIEN #3 I have been chosen!!
Positioned with his back to Sid, the alien is lifted up by the claw.
ALIEN #3 Farewell, my friends!
ALIEN #3 I go on to a better place.
SID Gotcha!
With the alien gone, Buzz's upper torso becomes exposed, forcing the space ranger to freeze.
Sid suddenly spots Buzz.
SID A Buzz Lightyear!
SID No way!
Woody, still hidden, frantically looks around for some way to escape.
Behind him, through the aliens, he eyes...
Woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door.
He grabs hold of the locking latch and, after a few attempts, is able to pry the door open.
The shadow of the crane lines up over Buzz, lowers, and grabs his head.
SID Yes!
The claw begins to lift Buzz up.
WOODY Buzz, NO!
Woody grabs hold of Buzz's feet.
Woody and the claw begin to have a tug-of-war with Buzz.
Woody pulls down hard, forcing Buzz to sink into the pile of aliens, out of Sid's view.
SID Wha -- ?
SID Hey!!
Still tugging against the crane, Woody is almost out the door with Buzz.
Just then, the aliens at the bottom of the pile pull Buzz and Woody back inside.
ALIEN #4 He has been chosen.
WOODY Hey!
WOODY What are you doing?
ALIEN #5 He must go.
WOODY Stop it, you -- !
WOODY Stop it, you zealots!
ALIENS He must go!
ALIENS Do not fight the claw!
ALIENS Do not anger the claw!
ALIENS He has been chosen.
Woody and Buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the air, dangling lifelessly in front of Sid.
SID Alright!
SID Double prizes!
Woody and Buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and snatched up by Sid.
SID Let's go home and...play.
SID Ha-ha-ha.
From out of the darkness appears Sid on his skateboard.
He is HUMMING to rock music from his walkman while carrying his backpack in his hand.
Sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front path towards the front door.
Through the open zipper, Buzz peeks out of the backpack to see Sid's house.
He recognizes Andy's house next door.
Buzz, Woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in the backpack.
BUZZ Sheriff!
BUZZ I can see your dwelling from here!
BUZZ You're almost home.
ALIEN Nirvana is coming!
ALIEN The mystic portal awaits!
WOODY Will you be quiet?!!
WOODY You guys don't get it, do you?
WOODY Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out.
The front door opens to reveal Scud.
The dog lunges straight for the backpack, BARKING.
SID Whoa, Scud!
SID Hey, boy.
SID Sit!
SID Good boy!
The dog begrudgingly obeys.
SID Hey, I got somethin' for ya, boy.
Sid's hand reaches into the backpack.
The toys go still.
Sid's hand grabs the alien out of the backpack.
The alien is then placed sideways along Scud's snout.
SID Ready, set, NOW.
In one quick motion, Scud flips the alien up, catches it in his mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth.
Buzz and Woody react in horror.
SID Hannah!
SID Hey, Hannah!!!
Woody and Buzz glance up to see HANNAH, Sid's frail little sister, carrying her Janie Doll.
HANNAH What?
SID Did I get my package in the mail?
HANNAH I dunno.
SID Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
HANNAH I don't know!
SID Oh no, Hannah!
HANNAH What?
SID Look!
SID Janie!
He grabs the doll.
HANNAH Hey!!
SID She's sick!
HANNAH No she's NOT --
SID I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
HANNAH NO-O-O...
HANNAH Don't touch her!
HANNAH NO!
Sid bolts upstairs with Hannah in pursuit.
WOODY Not Sid's room...not there...
Sid races to his bedroom door.
Hannah is right behind.
HANNAH Sid!
HANNAH Give her back!
Sid just LAUGHS.
He charges into the room and slams the door in his sister's face.
HANNAH Sid!
HANNAH Sid!...
Sid carelessly tosses the backpack on the bed and walks over to a makeshift workbench.
SID Oh, no.
SID We have a sick patient here, nurse.
SID Prepare the O.R., STAT!
Sid CLICKS on a bare bulb dangling above his "operating table."
Woody and Buzz look on from the safety of the backpack as Sid places the Janie doll's head in a vise.
HANNAH Sid, give her back!
HANNAH Give her back now!
HANNAH I'm telling!
SID Patient is...
SID ...pre-e-epped.
Sid grabs a painter's mask from his toolchest and dons it like a surgeon's mask.
SID No one's ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before.
Sid grabs a toy pterodactyl from a nearby crate full of junk.
SID Now for the tricky part -- pliers!
BUZZ I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.
Sid struggles for a moment with his "patient" then stops.
SID Doctor, you've done it!
SID Hannah?
He opens the door.
Hannah is standing there, looking worried.
SID Janie's all better now.
He hands her Janie -- her head has been replaced with a pterodactyl's.
Hannah SCREAMS at the sight of the monstrosity and bolts down the hallway.
SID She's lying!
SID Whatever she says it's not true!
Sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after Hannah, slamming the door behind him.
Woody and Buzz peer out of the backpack at their new surroundings.
Heavy metal posters, discarded toy remains and power tools adorn the messy room.
They are in Hell...toy Hell.
WOODY We are gonna die.
WOODY I'm outta here!
Woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles to open it.
No good.
Woody drops to the floor.
WOODY Locked!
WOODY There's gotta be another way out of here.
Woody is startled by the noise.
A small yo-yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its side.
Spooked, Woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes it like a weapon.
Just then a shadow passes by Woody.
He turns quickly but sees nothing.
WOODY Uh...Buzz?
WOODY Was that you?
Woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight.
He hears a NOISE from under Sid's bed.
Woody turns on the flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the noise, illuminating...
WOODY Hey!
WOODY Hi, there, little fellah!
WOODY Come out here.
WOODY Do you know a way out of here?
The baby doll moves out from under the bed, revealing a one- eyed doll head atop a spider-like body made of erector set pieces.
The creature extends its legs and rises up taller than Woody.
Scared speechless, Woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on
Various other MUTANT TOYS begin to emerge from the shadows: a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs, a skateboard with a combat soldier's torso screwed to the front end, a jack- in-the-box with a rubber hand for a head, (and others).
Woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind Buzz.
WOODY B-B-B-Buzz!
Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as they grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging them off into the shadows.
BUZZ They're cannibals!
Woody retreats back into the backpack.
Woody cowers in the corner as Buzz enters.
He punches a button on his chest.
BUZZ May day!
BUZZ May day!
BUZZ Come in, Star Command!
BUZZ Send reinforcements!...
BUZZ Star Command, do you copy?
No response.
Buzz adjusts his laser light.
It emits a short BLIP.
BUZZ I've set my laser from stun to kill.
WOODY Oh, great, great.
WOODY Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Rex points a flashlight out of Andy's bedroom window while Bo Peep, Slinky, Hamm and Potato Head look on.
Some bushes rustle below.
REX Hey, you guys!
REX I think I've found him.
REX Buzz!
REX Is that you?!
Rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes.
The annoyed MEOW of a cat is heard.
REX Whiskers!
REX Will you get out of here?!
REX You're interfering with the search and rescue.
Rex turns off the flashlight.
REX Look!
REX They're home!
The toys duck behind the sill.
The Davis' family van pulls into the driveway.
Andy and Mrs.
Davis get out.
ANDY Mom, have you seen Woody?
MRS. DAVIS Where was the last place you left him?
ANDY Right here in the van.
MRS. DAVIS Oh, I'm sure he's there.
MRS. DAVIS You're just not looking hard enough.
ANDY He's not here, Mom.
ANDY Woody's gone.
The toys all look at one another.
BO PEEP Woody's gone?!
HAMM Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran away.
Hamm, Potato Head and Rex walk away from the window.
MR. POTATO HEAD Huh?!
MR. POTATO HEAD Huh?!
MR. POTATO HEAD I told you he was guilty.
REX Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Bo Peep and Slinky are left alone at the window, visibly crestfallen.
BO PEEP Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.
SID Oh, a survivor.
SID Where is the rebel base?
SID Talk!
An inanimate Woody flies across the room, landing hard on the floor.
Sid crosses to the window.
SID I can see your will is strong.
Sid opens the window shade.
Bright sunlight shines down onto Woody.
SID Well, we have ways of making you talk.
Sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and focuses the beam on Woody's forehead.
SID Where are your rebel friends now?
SID Heh, heh.
A bright white hot dot forms on Woody's forehead and begins to smolder.
SID'S MOM Sid!!
SID'S MOM Your pop-tarts are ready!
Sid pulls the magnifying glass away.
SID Alright!!
Sid runs out of the room.
As soon as he's gone, Woody jumps up SCREAMING, his forehead burning.
He runs to a bowl of half-eaten cereal (with milk) on the floor, and dunks his head in.
Buzz runs over to Woody, pausing to remove two suction cup darts from his person before pulling Woody out of the bowl.
Two colorful Froot-Loops stick to each of Woody's eyes like glasses.
BUZZ Are you alright?
BUZZ I'm proud of you, Sheriff.
BUZZ A lesser man would have talked under such torture.
Woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead.
WOODY I sure hope this isn't permanent.
BUZZ Still no word from Star Command.
BUZZ We're not that far from the spaceport --
Woody's eyes light up.
Sid's bedroom door can be seen in the reflection.
It's open.
WOODY The door!
WOODY It's open!
WOODY We're free!!
Woody runs for the door.
Buzz follows.
BUZZ Woody, we don't know what's out there!
WOODY I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
THE MUTANT TOYS suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway.
Woody hides behind Buzz.
WOODY They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!
WOODY Do something!
WOODY Quick!
BUZZ Shield your eyes!
Buzz fires his laser at them.
The little red beam just flickers against Babyface's head.
The mutant toys look confusedly at each other.
BUZZ It's not working.
BUZZ I recharged it before I left.
BUZZ It should be good for hours --
WOODY Oh, you idiot!
WOODY You're a toy!
WOODY Use your karate chop action!
Grabbing Buzz like a hostage, Woody fends off the mutant toys by pushing a large button on Buzz's back, making Buzz's arm involuntarily "chop" up and down.
WOODY Get away!
WOODY Hoo-cha!
WOODY Hoo-cha!
BUZZ Hey!!
BUZZ Hey!
BUZZ How are you doing that?
BUZZ Stop that!
WOODY Back!
WOODY Back, you savages!
WOODY Back!
Woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway, continually chopping Buzz's arm.
BUZZ Woody, stop it!!
WOODY Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Woody drops Buzz and runs out the door.
Woody races down the corridor...
WOODY There's no place like home.
WOODY There's no place like home.
WOODY There's no place like home...
...turns onto the top of the stairwell, down a few steps, and is confronted by...
SCUD asleep on the landing.
Woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast.
He slowly backs up the stairs.
Suddenly Buzz appears and pulls Woody back against the hallway wall.
He covers Woody's mouth with his hand.
BUZZ Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
WOODY Don't tell me what to do!
BUZZ Shhh!
Buzz checks to make sure Scud is still asleep and then darts across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway.
Once safely across, he motions for Woody to follow.
Woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and meets up with Buzz.
As he stands...
WOODY'S PULLSTRING RING gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing.
The toys begin to creep down the hallway, unaware that Woody's pullstring is being pulled farther and farther until --
It SNAPS off the iron railing and flies back towards Woody.
Both Buzz and Woody leap in surprise at the sound of Woody's voice box.
It opens.
Woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) Giddy-up partner!...
GROWLING, Scud starts up the stairs.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) ...We got to get this wagon train a movin'!
Woody and Buzz take off running.
BUZZ Split up!
Two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway.
Buzz dives behind one while Woody jumps into...
Woody slams the door shut just as Scud reaches the top of the landing.
CRASHED can be heard from behind the closet door, getting Scud's attention.
Buzz peeks out from his doorway at Scud SNIFFING AND GROWLING at the closet.
Sensing movement behind him, Scud whips around and starts to enter Buzz's doorway.
The noise stops the dog in his tracks.
Both Scud and Buzz look up to see...
MR.
PHILLIPS is asleep on a La-Z-Boy recliner in front of the T.V.
Scud backs out and heads down the stairs.
Buzz turns to exit the room when he hears...
SPACE COMMANDER (O.S.; ON TV) Calling Buzz Lightyear!!
SPACE COMMANDER (O.S.; ON TV) Come in Buzz Lightyear!!
SPACE COMMANDER (O.S.; ON TV) This is Star Command.
SPACE COMMANDER (O.S.; ON TV) Buzz Lightyear!
SPACE COMMANDER (O.S.; ON TV) Do you read me?!
BUZZ Star Command!
Buzz opens up his wrist communicator and is just about to speak into it when he is interrupted.
KID #1 Buzz Lightyear responding!
KID #1 Read you loud and clear!
Buzz turns around to see...
Buzz's space ranger logo is on the screen over a field of stars.
The image quickly changes to two young boys playing in their backyard with a Buzz Lightyear doll.
SPACE COMMANDER Buzz Lightyear, Planet Earth needs your help!
KID #1 On the way!
Buzz reacts with confusion at what he is watching.
He walks slowly towards the television set.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The world's greatest superhero!
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Now the world's greatest TOY!
The Buzz Lightyear doll is now out of the box and being displayed.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Buzz has it all!
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Locking wrist communicator!
KID #1 Calling Buzz Lightyear.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Karate chop action!
KID #2 Wow!
With every feature demonstrated on the TV, Buzz compares the same feature on himself.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Pulsating laserlight!
KID #2 Total annihilation!
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Multi-phrase voice simulator!
TV BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE) It's a secret mission in uncharted space!
Buzz presses the same button on his uniform.
BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE) It's a secret mission in uncharted space!
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And best of all...
TV BUZZ To Infinity and Beyond!
On the TV screen, the Buzz Lightyear action figure appears to be launched through the air.
The words: NOT A FLYING TOY flash across the bottom of the screen.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Not a flying toy.
Buzz slowly shakes his head in wide-eyed disbelief.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure and save a galaxy near you!
The image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds of Buzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle.
LOCAL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets in the tri-county area.
Buzz is stricken.
He looks down at his wrist communicator and opens it.
Molded on the underside of the cover are three words: "MADE
Buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway.
As he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up through the railing at...
It is open, revealing the blue sky beyond.
A bird flies past.
The taunting voice of Woody echoes in his head.
WOODY (V.O.) You are a toy!
WOODY (V.O.) You can't fly!
Buzz bows his head, defeated.
Slowly Buzz raises his head, determination in his eyes.
He slams the offending wrist communicator shut, as if to deny its message of "Made in Taiwan."
Buzz climbs up the railing to the banister.
He pops open his wings, and aims himself towards the window above.
BUZZ To Infinity and Beyond!
Buzz leaps off the banister...
and falls.
In SLOW MOTION Buzz watches his square of blue sky pull farther away from him as he plummets to the floor below.
Buzz CRASHES on the entryway floor.
Buzz opens his eyes to see...
The broken arm lies a few inches away from his now empty arm socket.
Buzz drops his head back in defeat.
HANNAH M-o-o-om?
HANNAH Mom, have you seen my Sally doll?
Hannah walks into the entryway, and not seeing Buzz, steps on him.
MOM What, dear?
MOM What was that?
Hannah picks up Buzz (and his arm) and smiles.
HANNAH Nevermind.
The knob jiggles for a moment.
Suddenly, the door flies open revealing Woody, entangled in Christmas lights, standing atop a pile of boxes to be at doorknob height.
Woody and the rest of the junk topple over.
A bowling ball topples out, smashing Woody square on the head.
WOODY Oo-o-of!
WOODY Buzz?!
WOODY The coast is clear.
WOODY Buzz?
WOODY Where are you?
BUZZ (O.S.; SAMPLED VOICE) It's a secret mission in uncharted space!
BUZZ (O.S.; SAMPLED VOICE) Let's go!!
Woody creeps down the hallway, dragging the Christmas lights with him.
HANNAH Really?
HANNAH That is so-o-o interesting.
Woody peeks into the open doorway of...
Hannah is pretending to have a tea party.
Her guests are dolls, headless dolls, that is except for...
He is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frilly apron and fashionable party hat.
HANNAH Would you like some tea, Mrs. Nesbit?
WOODY Buzz!
Hannah has placed a tiny teapot in Buzz's severed arm and pours imaginary tea with it.
HANNAH It's so nice you could join us on such late notice.
Woody steps back into the hallway.
WOODY Oh, no!
HANNAH What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbit.
HANNAH It goes quite well with your head.
Woody thinks for a moment, then takes a few steps further down the hall.
He CLEARS HIS THROAT.
WOODY Hannah!
WOODY Oh, Hannah!
Hannah stops pouring tea and looks up.
HANNAH Mom?
HANNAH Please excuse me, ladies.
HANNAH I'll be right back.
As soon as Hannah exits the room Buzz keels over face-down onto the table.
Hannah passes Woody, hidden in the Christmas lights, and walks downstairs.
HANNAH What is it, Mom?
HANNAH Mom, where are you?
Woody bolts into Hannah's room.
WOODY Buzz!
WOODY Hey, Buzz!
WOODY Are you okay?
Buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair.
BUZZ Gone!
BUZZ It's all go-o-one!
BUZZ All of it's gone.
BUZZ Bye-bye!
BUZZ Whoo-hoo!
BUZZ See ya!
Woody picks up Buzz's severed arm.
WOODY What happened to you?
BUZZ One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...
BUZZ ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
The headless dolls turn and wave.
Woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it on the table.
WOODY I think you've had enough tea for today.
WOODY Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
BUZZ Don't you get it?!
BUZZ You see the hat?
BUZZ I am Mrs. Nesbit!!
WOODY Snap out of it, Buzz!
Woody presses Buzz's helmet open, slaps him across the face with his own detached arm, and then politely closes the helmet.
Buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from Woody.
Buzz walks out of the room while Woody follows.
BUZZ I'm sorry.
BUZZ You're right.
BUZZ ...I'm just a little depressed, that's all.
BUZZ I can get through this.
Buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees.
BUZZ Oh, I'm a sham!!
WOODY Sh-h-h-h-h!!
WOODY Quiet, Buzz.
BUZZ Look at me!
BUZZ I can't even fly out of a window!
Woody stops short.
He looks down the hallway in the direction of Sid's room.
Woody can see straight out Sid's window across the way to Andy's bedroom window.
BUZZ But -- the hat looked good.
BUZZ Tell me the hat looked good!
BUZZ The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
WOODY Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Woody grabs the coil of Christmas lights and drags Buzz towards Sid's room.
WOODY Come on, this way!
BUZZ Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Mr. Potato Head and Hamm are playing Battleship.
Hamm's wearing Potato Head's hat.
HAMM Miss.
HAMM G-6.
MR. POTATO HEAD Ohhh!
MR. POTATO HEAD You sunk it!
HAMM Heh-heh.
MR. POTATO HEAD Are you peeking?
HAMM Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
Potato Head reaches for his ear.
HAMM No, no, not the ear.
HAMM Gimme the nose.
HAMM C'mon!
MR. POTATO HEAD How 'bout three out of five?
He is about to hand his nose over to Hamm when...
WOODY Hey guys!
WOODY Guys!
WOODY Hey!
Both toys look across the way.
Woody has just finished lifting Sid's window and waves to the toys.
MR. POTATO HEAD Son of a building block, it's Woody!
HAMM He's in the psycho's bedroom!
WOODY Hi!
HAMM Everyone, it's Woody!
Slinky, Bo Peep and Rex look to the window.
BO PEEP Woody?!
REX You're kidding?
SLINKY Woody?!
WOODY We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Buzz is not there.
Woody looks down at the floor.
Buzz is sitting on the floor, playing "bombs away" with his broken arm.
The rest of Andy's toys gather around the window to see Woody.
REX Hey, look!
BO PEEP Woody!
WOODY Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
SLINKY I knew you'd come back, Woody!
BO PEEP What are you doing over there?
WOODY It's a long story, Bo.
WOODY I'll explain later.
WOODY Here, catch this!
Woody tosses one end of the Christmas lights over.
Slinky catches them.
SLINKY I got it, Woody!
REX He got it, Woody!
WOODY Good going, Slink!
WOODY Now, just, just tie it on to something!
MR. POTATO HEAD Wait!
MR. POTATO HEAD Wait!
MR. POTATO HEAD I got a better idea!
MR. POTATO HEAD How about we DON'T?!
Potato Head grabs the string of lights away from Slinky.
SLINKY Hey?!!
BO PEEP Potato Head!?
MR. POTATO HEAD Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!
MR. POTATO HEAD Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?
MR. POTATO HEAD And now you want to let him back over here?
WOODY No, no, no!
WOODY You got it all wrong, Potato Head.
WOODY Buzz is fine!
WOODY Buzz is right here.
WOODY He's with me!
MR. POTATO HEAD You are a liar!
WOODY No, I'm not!
WOODY Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
He doesn't respond, preoccupied with peeling off the sticker on his wrist communicator.
He crumples it up and tosses it aside.
WOODY Just a sec.
Frantic, Woody walks over to the edge of the desk.
WOODY Buzz!
WOODY Will you get up here and give me a hand?!
Buzz's severed arm comes flying into view and lands by Woody's feet.
WOODY Ha ha.
WOODY That's very funny, Buzz.
WOODY This is serious!!
REX Hey, Woody!?
REX Where'd ya go?
MR. POTATO HEAD He's lyin'.
MR. POTATO HEAD Buzz ain't there.
Woody reappears at the edge of Sid's window.
He pretends to notice something out of the other toy's view.
WOODY Oh, hi Buzz!
WOODY Why don't you say "hello" to the guys over there?
BUZZ'S SEVERED ARM suddenly appears with Woody holding the end just out of sight.
Woody throws his voice, pretending to be Buzz.
WOODY (AS BUZZ) Hi ya, fellas.
WOODY (AS BUZZ) To infinity and beyond!
REX Hey look!
REX It's Buzz!
WOODY Yeah, hey Buzz.
WOODY Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.
WOODY Gimme five, man!
HAMM Something's screwy here.
WOODY So, you see?
WOODY We're friends now, guys.
WOODY Aren't we, Buzz?
WOODY You bet.
WOODY Gimme a hug.
Woody makes Buzz's arm grab his neck and pull him forward.
WOODY Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
SLINKY See?
SLINKY It is Buzz.
SLINKY Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
MR. POTATO HEAD Wait just a minute.
MR. POTATO HEAD What are you trying to pull?!
WOODY Nothing.
Woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up...
...exposing the severed arm.
The toys all SCREAM in horror.
Rex clasps his hands to his mouth and turns away to BARF.
Realizing his mistake, Woody tries to hide the arm, but it's too late.
HAMM Oh, that is disgusting.
MR. POTATO HEAD Murderer!
WOODY No!
WOODY No, no, no, no!
MR. POTATO HEAD You murdering dog!
WOODY No, it's not what you think, I swear!
MR. POTATO HEAD Save it for the jury.
MR. POTATO HEAD I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
Potato Head drops the lights.
WOODY No!
WOODY No!
WOODY Don't leave!
WOODY Don't leave!
WOODY You've gotta help us, please!
WOODY You don't know what it's like over here!
MR. POTATO HEAD Come on.
MR. POTATO HEAD Let's get out of here.
HAMM Go back to your lives, citizens.
HAMM Show's over.
All the toys leave the window except Slinky.
WOODY Come back!
WOODY Slink!
WOODY Slink, please!
WOODY Please!
WOODY Listen to me!
Unable to look Woody in the eye, Slinky closes the blinds.
WOODY No!
WOODY No!
WOODY Come back!
WOODY SLI-I-I-INKYYY!!
As storm clouds roll over Sid's house, Woody slumps over the window sill in defeat.
BROKEN TOY SOUNDS emit from behind Woody.
He turns from the window to see...
THE MUTANT TOYS converging all around Buzz.
Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from the desk and runs to Buzz's rescue.
WOODY Go away, you disgusting freaks!
Babyface turns from the fray and charges at Woody with his erector-set pinchers.
Woody cowers, shielding himself from Buzz's arm.
Babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug-o-war with Woody.
WOODY Alright back!
WOODY Back, you cannibals!
Woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room, crashing into the wall.
By now there is no sight of Buzz within the swarming mass of mutant toys.
Woody attacks the mob with a vengeance.
WOODY He is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters!
He furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his way to...
He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached.
Woody's anger turns to confusion.
WOODY Hey?!
WOODY Hey, they fixed you!
Woody shakes Buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is real when he looks to the mutants.
WOODY But -- but they're cannibals.
WOODY We saw them eat those other toys.
The mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of Sid's last "operation": The Janie Doll and Pterodactyl.
Their heads have been taped back on the correct bodies.
The mutants all innocently stare at Woody.
WOODY Uh...sorry.
WOODY I...I thought that you were gonna...
WOODY ...you know, eat my friend.
Immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the dark corners of the room.
WOODY Hey!
WOODY No, no, wait!
WOODY Hey!
WOODY What's wrong?
SID'S MOM Sid!
SID Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
WOODY Sid!!!
FOOTSTEPS approach the bedroom.
Woody tries to pick up the still depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp.
WOODY Buzz!
WOODY C'mon, get up!
WOODY Buzz, you're...
WOODY ...get up...
Woody begins dragging Buzz towards the bed, but their progress is too slow.
He shakes Buzz hard.
WOODY Fine.
WOODY Let Sid trash you.
WOODY But don't blame me.
Woody leaves Buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as...
Sid enters carrying a big box.
SID It came!
SID It finally came!
Sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box.
SID The big one.
He pulls out a rocket with "THE BIG ONE" written on it.
SID "Extremely dangerous.
SID Keep out of reach of children."
SID COOL...
SID What am I gonna blow?
SID Man...hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll?
Sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up.
No Woody.
Out of Sid's view, Woody presses against the inside, hanging on for dear life.
Sid looks down and notices he's stepping on Buzz, activating his laser.
SID Yes!
SID I've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit.
SID Ha-ha.
He places Buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws a toolbox on top of the crate.
The impact of the toolbox dislodges Woody from his hiding place.
Woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of the crate "jail."
Woody watches helplessly as Sid fishes out a roll of electrical tape from the toolbox and, with an IRREVERENT CHUCKLE, tapes Buzz to the rocket.
A flash of lightning interrupts the moment.
SID Oh, no...
Sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence.
Sullenly, he smacks his head against the window.
SID Aw, man...!
Woody heaves a SIGH of relief.
Suddenly Sid's face brightens.
He turns his focus from the rain to the Buzzrocket.
SID Sid Phillips reporting.
SID Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site.
SID Tomorrow's forecast...
Sid smacks Buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, and places it next to Buzz.
SID Sunny.
SID Ha-ha-ha.
SID Sweet dreams.
Andy is being tucked into bed by his mother.
She hands him his cowboy hat.
MRS. DAVIS I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
ANDY But what if we leave them behind?
MRS. DAVIS Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
Andy's eyes shut.
Mom turns out the light and quietly exits the room.
A moving box on the floor, with the words "Andy's Toys!" scrawled on it, begins to shake from side to side.
REX Aaaah!
REX I need air!
Rex pops out of the top of the box, COUGHING a packing styrofoam peanut out of his mouth.
Potato Head appears beside him.
REX Aa-a-a-a-ah!
MR. POTATO HEAD Will you quit moving around?!
REX I'm sorry.
REX It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
MR. POTATO HEAD How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
Potato Head drops back down into the box.
REX Everyone else was picked.
BO PEEP peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at Andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat.
BO PEEP Oh, Woody, if only you could see how much Andy misses you.
THUNDER RUMBLES as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling.
Sid is in bed fast asleep.
Woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail, but with the weight of the toolbox on top it won't budge.
Woody looks across the desktop at Buzz sitting dejectedly with the rocket strapped to his back.
WOODY Ps-s-s-s-t!
WOODY Psst!
WOODY Hey, Buzz!
No reaction from Buzz.
Woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings it at Buzz, striking his helmet.
Buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at Woody.
WOODY Hey!
WOODY Get over here and see if you can get this tool box off me.
Buzz just looks away from Woody and bows his head.
WOODY Oh, come on, Buzz.
WOODY I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.
WOODY I need your help.
BUZZ I can't help.
BUZZ I can't help anyone.
WOODY Why, sure you can, Buzz.
WOODY You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
BUZZ Andy's house.
BUZZ Sid's house.
BUZZ What's the difference.
WOODY Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.
WOODY You must not be thinking clearly.
BUZZ No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.
BUZZ You were right all along.
BUZZ I'm not a Space Ranger.
BUZZ I'm just a toy.
BUZZ A stupid little insignificant toy.
WOODY Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.
WOODY Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
BUZZ Yeah, right.
WOODY No, it is.
WOODY Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!
WOODY You are HIS toy.
BUZZ But why would Andy want me?
WOODY Why would Andy want you?!
WOODY Look at you!
WOODY You're a Buzz Lightyear.
WOODY Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.
WOODY You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
Woody pauses and looks at himself.
WOODY As a matter of fact you're too cool.
WOODY I mean -- I mean what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure?
WOODY All I can do is...
Woody pulls his own pull-string.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) There's a snake in my boots!
Woody bows his head.
WOODY Why would Andy ever want to play with me, when he's got you?
WOODY I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.
Woody slumps dejectedly against the crate, his back to Buzz.
Buzz lifts up his foot.
The signature "ANDY" reads through the dirt and scuff marks.
Buzz gazes back at Woody.
A look of determination spreads across his face.
WOODY Listen Buzz, forget about me.
WOODY You should get out of here while you can.
Silence.
Woody turns around.
Buzz is gone.
Suddenly, the entire milkcrate begins to shake.
Woody looks up to see...
He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off.
WOODY Buzz!!
WOODY What are you doing?
WOODY I thought you were --
BUZZ Come on, Sheriff.
BUZZ There's a kid over in that house who needs us.
BUZZ Now let's get you out of this thing.
WOODY Yes Sir!
Both Buzz and Woody push the milkcrate and together, they finally get it to move but it's slow progress.
WOODY Come on, Buzz!
WOODY We can do it!
The two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench.
With the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise...
A MOVING TRUCK can be seen pulling up in front of Andy's house.
BUZZ Woody!
BUZZ It's the moving van.
WOODY We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall.
Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might.
The toolbox begins to move.
Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the tool chest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the desk.
WOODY C'mon, Buzz.
Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through.
Woody drops down to the floor below.
WOODY Alright.
WOODY Buzz!
WOODY Hey!
WOODY I'm out!
Buzz doesn't hear Woody and continues to shove the toolbox (and milkcrate) farther out.
BUZZ ...almost
BUZZ ...there
Woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox and milkcrate topple towards him.
The toolbox CRASHES right on top of Woody.
Buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to Sid, who stirs...
SID I wanna ride the pony...
Sid does not wake.
Buzz heaves a SIGH OF RELIEF, then peers over the edge of the workbench.
BUZZ Woody!
BUZZ Woody?!
BUZZ Are you alright?!
Woody lifts himself out from under the rubble.
WOODY No, I'm fine...I'm okay...
It goes off by Sid's bed.
Woody drops back under the toolbox and Buzz goes limp.
Sid groggily sits up for a beat, then his eyes light up.
SID Oh, yeah!
SID Time for lift-off!
Sid jumps out of bed, grabs Buzz and bolts out of the room.
Woody leaps to his feet, runs across the room, and catches the door just before it closes.
As he swings the door back open Woody is confronted by...
The dog barrels down the hallway straight for Woody.
WOODY Aaah!
WOODY Back!
WOODY Back!
WOODY Down!
WOODY Down!
Woody slams the door shut just in time.
Scud BARKS AND SCRATCHES at the door.
WOODY Okay, what do I do?
WOODY Come on Woody, think!
Woody looks across the room.
THE MUTANT TOYS have appeared all around the room.
WOODY Guys!
The mutant toys all scatter and hide.
WOODY No, no, no!
WOODY Wait!
WOODY Wait!
WOODY Listen!
WOODY Please!
WOODY There's a good toy down there and he's -- he's going to be blown to bits in a few minutes all because of me.
WOODY I've gotta save him!
WOODY -- But I need your help.
No response.
Woody then notices Babyface timidly peeking out of the shadows from under the bed.
WOODY Please.
WOODY He's my friend.
WOODY He's the only one I've got.
Babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of Sid's metal bedpost.
The mutant toys emerge from the shadows, and gather around Woody.
He kneels down into a huddle with them.
WOODY Thank you.
WOODY Okay.
WOODY I think I know what to do.
WOODY We're going to have to break a few rules, but if it works, it'll help everybody.
THE MOVERS cart out the last load.
A forlorn Andy clutches onto Buzz's "spaceship" box in one hand and his cowboy hat in the other.
Andy scans the empty room and heaves a sad SIGH.
Sid comes out of the she carrying a bunch of materials under his arm.
SID Houston to Mission Control.
SID Come in, Control.
He drops the junk down beside an inanimate Buzz.
SID Launch pad is being constructed!
SID Heh-heh.
Scud is planted right outside Sid's bedroom door, poised to attack anything that exits.
Woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard out of dominoes and Scrabble tiles.
He points to it with a pencil as he addresses the mutants.
WOODY All right, listen up.
WOODY I need Pump Boy here -- Ducky here.
WOODY Legs?
LEGS, the toy fishing rod with fashion doll legs, steps forward from the crowd.
WOODY You're with Ducky.
WOODY RollerBob and I don't move till we get the signal.
WOODY Clear?
The mutants all give an affirmative nod.
WOODY Okay, let's move!
The toys all break.
Legs and DUCKY, a duck head Pez dispenser with baby doll torso and plunger base, rush over to a heating grate and pull the face plate off the wall.
They disappear into the heating duct.
Ducky and Legs come to an intersection.
Ducky QUACKS and they head down the right tunnel.
HAND-IN-THE-BOX, the rubber hand in the Jack-in-the-box, stacks on top of several mutant toys to reach the doorknob of the bedroom door.
Woody hops onto ROLLERBOB, a skateboard with a soldier's upper torso tied to its front.
WOODY Wind the frog!
WALKING CAR, a Hot Wheels car with baby arms, begins winding up THE FROG, a tin wind-up frog with monster truck wheels instead of legs.
A bottom of wall insulation is pushed aside to reveal Ducky and Legs.
They make their way towards a junction box sitting in the center of the floor.
Ducky and Legs lift the loose junction box.
THE BROKEN PORCH LIGHT suddenly lifts upward and disappears into the roof.
Ducky extends his Pez neck out of the hole to check that the coast is clear.
All the toys have manned their positions and wait silently, their eyes fixed on Woody.
WOODY Wait for the signal.
Ducky takes the end of the line off Legs' fishing reel, hooks it onto himself, and is then lowered down through the open hole.
Hanging halfway down the front door, Ducky begins to swing.
Eventually he swings far enough to reach his destination: the doorbell.
Ducky presses it.
Woody throws his arm down.
WOODY Go!!
Hand-in-the-box throws open the door and The Frog is let loose.
The Frog zips through Scud's legs and down the hallway.
Scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs.
HANNAH I'll get it!
Woody helps the rest of the mutant toys onto the skateboard.
WOODY Alright, let's go.
Using his front arms, Rollerbob propels the skateboard and crew out into the hallway.
Hannah walks to the front door...
HANNAH I'm coming!
HANNAH I'm coming!
...and opens it.
Nobody's there.
Hannah doesn't notice Ducky stuck to the porch floor by his plunger.
THE FROG zooms down the stairs with Scud BARKING right behind.
The Frog leaps off the last step, speeds through Hannah's legs and out the open front door.
Hannah looks back inside at Scud.
In that moment, Ducky catches the Frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into the roof.
Scud bursts through Hannah's legs, knocking her over, and runs out onto the empty porch.
Scud suddenly realizes he's been duped, but before he can get back inside, Hannah slams the front door shut.
HANNAH Stupid dog.
Scud smashes into the closed door and begins BARKING furiously.
As Hannah storms off into another room she doesn't notice Woody and the mutants zipping off the stairs and round the corner, heading straight into the kitchen.
By now RollerBob has really picked up speed.
He shoots underneath the kitchen table, through the maze of chair legs, straight towards...
WOODY Lean back!
The mutants all push back causing the RollerBob to do a wheelie.
They smash through the doggie door...
...and catapult into the bushes.
The toys peek out from the bush to see Buzz strapped to the launchpad.
Sid is still in the toolshed.
SID (O.S.; AS ASTRONAUT) Uh, Mission Control...is the launchpad construction complete?
SID (O.S.; AS ASTRONAUT) --
SID (O.S.; AS ASTRONAUT) Uh, Roger, rocket is now secured to guide wire.
SID (O.S.; AS ASTRONAUT) We are currently obtaining the...ignition sticks.
SID (O.S.; AS ASTRONAUT) Countdown will commence momentarily.
SID (O.S.; AS ASTRONAUT) Stand by --
Ducky, Legs, and the Frog shoot out into the yard from a drain pipe.
They exchange a thumbs-up with Woody.
WOODY Let's go!
The mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard.
SID Hey, Mom?!
SID Where are the matches?
SID Oh, oh, wait, here they are.
SID Nevermind...
Woody runs towards Buzz, who spots Woody approaching.
BUZZ Woody?!
BUZZ Great!
BUZZ Help me out of this thing!
Woody stops a few feet away from Buzz.
WOODY Shhhhhhh!
BUZZ What?!
WOODY It's ok.
WOODY Everything's under control.
Woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass.
BUZZ Woody?!
BUZZ What are you doing?!
Sid emerges from the tool shed.
Buzz freezes.
SID (AS ASTRONAUT) Houston, all systems are go.
SID (AS ASTRONAUT) Requesting permission to launch --
SID (AS ASTRONAUT) Hey!
SID (AS ASTRONAUT) How'd you get out here?
Sid picks up Woody, examines him for a beat and then smiles.
SID Oh, well, you and I can have a cookout later.
SID Ha-ha-ha...
He sticks a match prominently in Woody's holster and tosses him onto the grill of an open barbecue.
SID (AS ASTRONAUT) Houston, do we have permission to launch?
SID (AS ASTRONAUT) --
SID (AS ASTRONAUT) Uh, Roger, permission granted.
SID (AS ASTRONAUT) You are confirmed at T minus 10 seconds...
During Sid's countdown, all the mutants scurry into their final positions.
Sid lights a match.
SID ...and counting.
SID Ten!
SID Nine!
SID Eight!
SID Seven!
SID Six!
SID Five!
SID Four!
SID Three!
SID Two!...
SID One!...
Sid grins menacingly as the match moves towards the fuse.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) Reach for the sky!!
SID Huh?
Sid pulls back from lighting the fuse.
He turns to look at Woody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except for the sound emitting from his voice box.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
SID What?!
Sid walks over to Woody and picks him up.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
SID It's busted.
He raises Woody up, about to throw him away --
WOODY (VOICE BOX) Who are you callin' busted, Buster?!
Sid stops short and looks at Woody again.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) That's right.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) I'm talking to YOU, Sid Phillips.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) We don't like being blown up, Sid, or smashed, or ripped apart...
While Woody's voice box talks, Sid checks the pullstring.
It isn't moving.
Sid GULPS.
SID W-w-w-we?
WOODY (VOICE BOX) That's right.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) Your toys.
The remains of broken toys in the yard, led by the bedroom mutants, begin rising from the ground in "NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD" fashion.
The toys march forward, forming a circle around Sid.
Sid is too frightened to scream or move.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) From now on, you must take good care of your toys.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) Because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) We toys can see...
Woody's inanimate head rotates 360 degrees.
WOODY (VOICE BOX) ...everything.
For a split second Woody's face comes to life.
WOODY So play nice.
Sid drops Woody and bolts inside the house.
Woody and all the toys CHEER VICTORIOUSLY.
Hannah has just come downstairs carrying a new doll when Sid rushes up to her.
SID The toys!
SID The toys are alive!
Sid eyes Hannah's doll and pats it gently on the head.
SID N-N-Nice dolly...
Hannah, sensing Sid's fear, suddenly thrusts the doll in Sid's face.
He SCREAMS and runs upstairs.
Hannah chases after him, taunting.
HAMM What's wrong, Sid?!
HAMM Don't you want to play with Sally?!
The toys are all congratulating one another.
WOODY Nice work, fellahs.
WOODY Good job.
WOODY Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!
WOODY That was a stroke of genius.
BUZZ Woody!
Woody turns around and looks at Buzz, who's still affixed to Sid's launchpad.
Buzz extends his hand to Woody.
BUZZ Thanks.
They shake.
DAVIS Everybody say, "Bye, house."
ANDY Bye, house.
Buzz and Woody look in the direction of Andy's house.
Through the fence, Andy and his family can be seen getting into the van.
BUZZ Woody!
BUZZ The van!
Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to.
WOODY We gotta run!
WOODY Thanks, guys.
With the rocket still taped to Buzz, the two toys sprint towards the fence.
WOODY Quick!
Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, but Buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck.
Woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van before realizing that Buzz is missing.
He looks back to discover Buzz stuck in the fence.
BUZZ Just go!
BUZZ I'll catch up!
Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz.
The van begins pulling out of the driveway.
Woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks Buzz free of the fence.
The two toys run out into the street just in time to see the van driving off down the street.
Woody and Buzz turn around.
THE MOVING VAN drives right over them.
Woody and Buzz SCREAM, ducking just in time.
After the truck passes, Buzz runs after it with Woody a few steps behind.
BUZZ Come on!
Scud is lying on the porch when he suddenly perks up at the sight of the two tiny toys running down the street after the moving truck.
Scud bears his teeth and GROWLS.
Buzz runs up close to the truck with Woody still back a few paces.
A STRAP dangles off the back of the truck.
Buzz makes a leap for it and grabs hold.
He climbs up the strap and onto the bumper.
Woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach.
BUZZ You can do it, Woody.
Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap.
WOODY Whew, I made it!
Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale.
Woody looks behind him to see...
The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs.
WOODY Aaaaaahh!!
WOODY Get away, you stupid dog!
WOODY Down!
WOODY Down!
Scud tugs on Woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap.
BUZZ Hold on, Woody!
WOODY I can't do it!
WOODY Take care of Andy for me!
Buzz leaps off of the truck and onto Scuds snout.
He grabs Scud's eyelids and snaps them hard.
Scud YELPS, letting go of Woody.
The dog bucks wildly with Buzz hanging onto his face.
WOODY Buzz!
The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz and Scud behind.
Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto the bumper.
He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to lift up the heavy door.
Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at a traffic light.
Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking Woody with it.
Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truck until he spots what he's looking for.
A PILE OF MOVING BOXES with the words "ANDY'S TOYS" written on them in crayon.
Scud flings Buzz off his face.
Buzz goes tumbling under a parked car.
Scud runs over to the car, but is too big to get under it.
Woody rips into one of Andy's boxes.
All the toys wince and MOAN as they cover their eyes from the sudden brightness.
TOYS What?!
REX Are we there already?
SLINKY Woody?!
SLINKY How'd you --
Woody's response is to slide the box aside and begin rummaging through the next box.
Slinky, Potato Head, Rex and the other toys GRUMBLE IN CONFUSION as they poke their heads up out of the first box.
WOODY Ah-hah!
WOODY There you are!!
Woody pulls the RC Car and its remote out of the second box.
MR. POTATO HEAD Hey!
MR. POTATO HEAD What's he doing?
Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the RC Car out onto the street.
The other toys SCREAM in horror.
REX He's at it again!
Woody turns on the remote and steers the RC car past Scud and under the parked car where Buzz is hiding.
RC's motor WHIRRS happily at the sight of Buzz.
The traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck to cross the intersection.
MR. POTATO HEAD Get him!!!
All the toys pour out of their boxes and CHARGE on Woody.
WOODY Ah-h!!
WOODY Ah-h!
WOODY No, no!
Woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoid the angry mob of toys.
Buzz jumps on to the RC car and they zoom back towards the moving truck.
Scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down on Buzz --
Rocky picks up Woody and spins him over his head.
WOODY No, no, no!
WOODY Wait!
WOODY Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!
-- The RC car suddenly swerves from Scud's jaws and starts doing doughnuts (matching Woody's) in the middle of the street.
BUZZ Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!
Rocky throws Woody to the floor.
-- RC resumes his course straight down the street with Scud giving close chase.
Hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto Woody.
HAMM Pig pile!!
-- The RC car hops up in the air, tossing Buzz up and off.
Buzz manages to land back on RC, but facing backwards.
It changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes.
Buzz and the RC car drive straight into it.
Scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a halt just missing a car.
The car swerves and CRASHES into another car.
Soon there is a multi-car pile up that encircles Scud, entrapping the dog.
Buzz and the RC car emerge from the intersection safely on the other side.
The mob of toys lift up Woody (still holding the remote) and head for the open back.
WOODY No wait!
WOODY You don't understand!
WOODY Buzz is out there!
WOODY We've gotta help him!!
MR. POTATO HEAD Toss 'im overboard!
WOODY No, no, no, wait!
The toys toss him out into the road.
As the truck drives off, the toys CHEER.
MR. POTATO HEAD So long Woody!
Woody turns around and ducks just in time as a car passes over him.
Shaken, Woody tries to get up again when...
BUZZ & RC come barreling towards him.
BUZZ Who-o-o-oa!
BUZZ Woody!
The RC Car sweeps up Woody and keeps driving.
Woody finds himself sitting in front of Buzz (still holding the remote).
WOODY Well, thanks for the ride.
BUZZ Look out!!
The toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the car that had passed over Woody earlier.
Woody SCREAMS and gives the steering wheel on the remote a hard left, missing the tire by inches.
The RC Car moves up under the car.
WOODY Now let's catch up to that truck!
Woody flicks a switch from "ON" to "TURBO."
The RC Car speeds up towards the moving truck.
The toys are busy CONGRATULATING one another when Lenny, the wind-up binoculars, glances out the back and spots Buzz and Woody.
LENNY Guys!
LENNY Guys!
LENNY Woody's riding RC!
LENNY And Buzz is with him!
TOYS What?!!!
The toys rush to the edge of the open truck.
Bo picks up Lenny and looks through him.
BO PEEP It is Buzz!
BO PEEP Woody was telling the truth!
SLINKY What have we done?!
REX Great.
REX Now I have guilt.
The RC Car begins to gain on the truck.
WOODY We're almost there.
BO PEEP Rocky!
BO PEEP The ramp!
Rocky, the wrestler doll, rushes over to a lever on the side of the back.
The sign above it reads "RAMP: UP/DOWN."
Rocky pushes down hard on the lever.
The ramp begins to lower.
Woody & Buzz look up to see the ramp about to come down right on top of them.
BUZZ Look out!!
The RC Car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams into the road.
Sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping the pavement.
SLINKY Quick!
SLINKY Hold on to my tail!
Potato Head and Rex grabs on to Slinky's tail allowing Slinky's front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp.
Slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to Woody.
Woody hands the remote to Buzz and leans forward to grab Slinky's hand.
They grab hold of one another.
MR. POTATO HEAD That a boy, Slink!!
All of a sudden, the RC Car begins to slow down pulling Slinky's front end off the ramp.
SLINKY Woody!!
His slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch...
SLINKY Woody!
SLINKY Speed up!
WOODY Speed up!
BUZZ The batteries!
BUZZ They're running out!
RC's headlight eyes sag.
The car slows even more.
As Slinky continues stretching.
The RC Car begins to weave side-to-side like a water skier.
SLINKY Whoa!
SLINKY Whoa!
SLINKY Whoa!
With Mom and Andy preoccupied, baby Molly looks in her sideview mirror.
The RC Car (w/ Woody and Buzz) weaves into view and then back out.
Molly SQUEALS with delight.
With Slinky's mid-section stretched to the limit, he begins to lose his grip on Woody.
SLINKY I can't hold on much longer!
WOODY Slink!
WOODY Hang on!
Slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back into the moving truck and knocking over all the toys.
The RC Car sputters to a stop.
Woody and Buzz watch in vain as the family van and moving truck disappear.
Buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration.
WOODY Great!
BUZZ Woody!
BUZZ The rocket!
WOODY The match!
Woody pulls out the match from his holster that Sid had put there earlier.
WOODY Yes!
WOODY Thank you, Sid!
Woody runs around behind Buzz, strikes the match against RC's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when...
A CAR whizzes right over them, blowing out the match.
Woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls prostrate to the ground.
WOODY No-o-o!
WOODY No-no-no-no!
WOODY No-o-o!
Unable to watch a cowboy cry, Buzz bows his head, causing his helmet to block the sun from Woody.
As Buzz's shadow passes over him, Woody stops whimpering and looks at his hand.
A WHITE HOT DOT like the one generated from Sid's magnifying glass, appears on the back of Woody's hand.
Woody leaps up, grabs Buzz's helmet and aligns it so the white dot hits the tip of the fuse.
BUZZ Woody?!
BUZZ What are you doing?
WOODY Hold still, Buzz!
The fuse lights.
WOODY Ha-ha!!
BUZZ You did it!
BUZZ Next stop.
BUZZ Andy.
Woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling.
WOODY Wait a minute...I just lit a rocket.
WOODY Rockets explo --
The RC Car rockets forward.
Speeding along the dividing line in the road, it easily passes car after car until the moving truck can be seen on the horizon.
The toys are gathered around Slinky, his spring splayed out on the floor.
SLINKY I shoulda held on longer.
Lenny looks out the back again.
LENNY Look!
LENNY Look!
LENNY It's Woody and Buzz!
LENNY Comin' up fast!
The toys run to the opening and CHEER.
The rocket is so strong that it begins to lift Buzz and Woody off the RC Car.
Woody manages to continue holding onto RC -- but not for long.
The toys CHEERING turns to SCREAMING as they rush to get out of the way of the oncoming "RC rocket."
REX Take cover!!
Woody is forced to let go of the RC Car.
They separate, sending the two toys upward and RC into the back of the truck.
RC smashes into Potato Head, sending all of his parts flying.
The rocket hurtles upward higher and higher.
WOODY Ahhh!!
WOODY This is the part where we blow up!
BUZZ Not today!
Buzz confidently presses the button on his chest.
WINGS jut out of Buzz, severing the tape that holds him to rocket.
The toys separate from the rocket just before it BLOWS UP.
The toys plummet.
WOODY Ah-h-h-h-h!!
Just then Buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward again.
Woody takes a peek.
They're flying.
WOODY Hey, Buzz!!
WOODY You're flying!!
BUZZ This isn't flying.
BUZZ This is falling -- with style!
WOODY Ha ha!!
WOODY To Infinity and Beyond!!
They soar gracefully towards the moving truck, but then pass over it.
WOODY Uh, Buzz?!
WOODY We missed the truck!
BUZZ We're not aiming for the truck!
Buzz and Woody fly right over the van's sun roof and then drop into the car.
Before anyone can notice, Woody and Buzz land in an open box in the back seat right next to Andy.
Andy turns to discover the limp Buzz and Woody lying in the box.
ANDY Hey!
ANDY Wow!
MRS. DAVIS What?
MRS. DAVIS What is it?
ANDY Woody!
ANDY Buzz!
MRS. DAVIS Oh, great, you found them.
MRS. DAVIS Where were they?
ANDY Here!
ANDY In the car!
MRS. DAVIS See?
MRS. DAVIS Now, what did I tell you?
MRS. DAVIS Right where you left them.
Andy hugs both toys.
They give each other a knowing wink.
Through the gently falling snow, the Davis family can be seen around the Christmas tree unwrapping presents.
ANDY Which one can I open first?
MRS. DAVIS Let's let Molly open one.
One of the Christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal...
The plastic green soldier spies on the Davis family with his binoculars.
He turns and motions back into the tree.
A baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supported by several green army men.
One of the soldiers turns it on.
The receiving end of the monitor is atop Andy's night stand.
It CRACKLES WITH STATIC.
SARGENT Frankincense, this is Myrrh.
SARGENT Come in, Frankincense.
Buzz sits on the edge of Andy's bed while Hamm rests on the nightstand alongside the monitor.
They listen intently.
HAMM Hey, heads up everybody!
HAMM It's showtime.
Woody and the rest of the toys are MINGLING together like a typical office Christmas party.
REX Oh!
REX It's time!
The toys all stop and run towards the monitor.
Woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to reveal...
WOODY Whoooooah!
WOODY Oh!
WOODY Bo!
WOODY There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
BO PEEP Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
She smiles and points her crook upwards to her sheep perched on a shelf dangling mistletoe.
WOODY Say, isn't that mistletoe?
BO PEEP Mm-hmmmmm.
Bo drops her crook, dips Woody and KISSES him.
The rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor restless with "excitement" not fear.
REX Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur, like a leaf-eater.
REX That way, I could play the, uh, dominant predator.
REX Ha ha ha!
Slinky LAUGHS with Rex.
BUZZ Quiet everyone, quiet!
SARGENT Molly's first present i-i-is...Mrs.
SARGENT Potato Head.
SARGENT Repeat.
SARGENT A Mrs.
SARGENT Potato Head.
HAMM Way to go, Idaho!
All the toys CONGRATULATE Potato Head.
MR. POTATO HEAD Gee, I better shave.
Potato Head whips off his moustache piece.
Woody climbs up onto the bed and joins Buzz.
Lipstick now covers Woody's face.
SARGENT Come in, Frankincense.
SARGENT Andy is now opening his first present --
Buzz bangs on the side of the monitor.
Nothing.
WOODY Buzz.
WOODY Buzz Lightyear.
WOODY You are not worried, are you?
SARGENT I can't quite make out --
BUZZ Me?
BUZZ No, no, no, no...
BUZZ Are you?
WOODY Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
We TRUCK OUT through the window to the EXT.
as we HEAR...
ANDY Oh, what is it?
ANDY What is it?
ANDY Wow!
ANDY A puppy!
We ZOOM BACK through the window to a CLOSE UP of Buzz and Woody.
They look at one another with a half-smile, half-grimace and
