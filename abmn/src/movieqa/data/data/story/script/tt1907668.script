FLIGHT

Dec.
12, 2011
It's still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL ATLANTA.
The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only source of light as we hear a metallic rattle.
We follow the metallic rattle to a door.
The rattling stops and we watch the knob slowly turn.
Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces "hope."
We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the pulling of what looks like a large suitcase.
NICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage table out of the motel room.
With her bra in one hand and the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior 2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation.
She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues digging in her purse.
She finds a beat-up candy tin.
She opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt foils, heroin foils, looking for residue.
Nothing.
She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made.
She flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks better of it and hangs up.
NICOLE forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a 1988 Toyota Tercel and slams it shut.
We hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on "speaker phone" mode.
The phone rests on the passenger seat.
We pull up to find NICOLE slumped with her head resting on the steering wheel.
She is exhausted and irritated...
NICOLE Don't pick up...don't pick up...
NICOLE don't pick up...
A MAN answers with music in the background..."
Yo.."
NICOLE quickly picks up the phone.
NICOLE (CONT'D) It's Nic, do you have any?
NICOLE (CONT'D) Good morning to you too.
NICOLE (CONT'D) You're what?
NICOLE (CONT'D) Well, where are you guys shooting today?
NICOLE (CONT'D) Where?
NICOLE (CONT'D) Text me the address.
NICOLE (CONT'D) You have some...Okay.
She hangs up the phone and catching herself in the rearview she tries to smile.
The sun would be rising if the sky wasn't swirling with grey clouds.
We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando.
The sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture.
Through the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-time radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter...
An attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and gets out of bed.
She crosses naked through the room as a cell phone starts ringing.
Back to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo.
WHIP wears his 40 some years of life experience like a medal.
Smoke hangs in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP snatches up his phone and answers...
VOICE For the love of Christ!
VOICE Look...just hold...HOLD ON.
He aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the hotel ice bucket.
The naked, YOUNG WOMAN bends over to pick up her clothes.
We witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect crack down the middle.
Whip smiles, taking it all in...
WHIP I've been up since the crack 'a dawn.
WHIP What check?
WHIP Tuition?
WHIP How much does it cost to go there?
The YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands.
The YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second, hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag.
WHIP shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on the phone.
He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone.
WHIP (CONT'D) NO!
WHIP (CONT'D) NO!
WHIP (CONT'D) NO!
WHIP (CONT'D) You decided he needed private school...lemme talk to Knuckles.
WHIP (CONT'D) He's not?
WHIP (CONT'D) Tell'em the phone works both ways.
WHIP (CONT'D) Oh he's my son because you need a tuition check...that's great Deana.
WHIP (CONT'D) I'm glad you tracked me down in Orlando at 7 in the fucking morning to shake me down for money.
WHIP (CONT'D) Does he even like the fucking school?
WHIP (CONT'D) No I've never seen it.
WHIP (CONT'D) Yeah I wonder why not too.
WHIP (CONT'D) I gotta 9 o'clock flight, sit tight 'till I get back to Atlanta.
WHIP (CONT'D) How am I a liar?
WHIP (CONT'D) What?
WHIP (CONT'D) No, I'll call you.
WHIP hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window.
YOUNG WOMAN Was that your wife?
WHIP That was my ex-wife.
WHIP But you Trina, you could be my second or third wife if you'd just C'mere.
The YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively...
TRINA Whip, don't even joke about that.
TRINA Our flight's at 9, let's hit it.
TRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants.
WHIP can't help but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away.
ON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock anthem...JOE COCKER's "I'm Feeling Alright"
WHIP Yeah, I'm feelin' a little light- headed.
WHIP I shoulda ate somethin'.
WHIP leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's been cut in half.
He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke.
WHIP wears his pilot Blues and carries his hat as he strides confidently down the hallway.
JOE COCKER continues to wail, perfectly narrating the hero's swagger that WHIP maintains while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper.
WHIP leans against the landing gear of the JACKSON-RIDGEFIELD 88 PASSENGER JET -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of mouthwash -- gargles, then spits the green foam on the tarmac.
WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual walk around.
He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the jet way ladder.
His foot slips, sending his shoe SPLASHING in to a puddle.
WHIP Son of a bitch!
Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the stairs.
WHIP enters the jetway from the exterior door at the entrance of the plane.
TRINA is greeting a MAN and his SON.
WHIP Morning Miss Marquez.
TRINA Morning Captain Whitaker.
WHIP waits as TRINA politely parts the stream of folks to allow WHIP to enter the plane.
WHIP exchanges a look with a MATURE FLIGHT ATTENDANT, MARGARET THOMASON.
She can't help but smile...
MARGARET Captain Whitaker, that sky gonna hold?
MARGARET You're not gonna make me spend another night in Orlando?
WHIP Don't worry, Margaret I'm gonna get you home for your prayer meeting at...what is it?
WHIP Jesus Christ Superstar 27th Baptist King Church?
TRINA and CAMELIA SATOU, the other flight attendant, laugh.
MARGARET That's right, Christ the King First Baptist Church on Hazel and 9th Street.
MARGARET And I'm still saving you a seat next to me.
MARGARET Offer stands...come on down.
WHIP One of these nights, Margaret, I'm comin'.
WHIP You hold my seat.
The girls laugh at the familiar exchange.
WHIP enters the cockpit, removes his hat and nods to KEN EVANS, our clean-cut, young first officer.
WHIP G'morning.
WHIP Walk around is complete.
Whip pulls his emergency oxygen mask off the bulkhead and takes a huge hit.
WHIP (CONT'D) Emergency oxygen, checks.
WHIP (CONT'D) (offering the mask to
EVANS) You want a hit?
EVANS No thank you sir.
WHIP My pleasure to share the chair with ya'.
WHIP Didn't we fly together...
EVANS lets him hang...
EVANS No sir, not that I remember.
EVANS Ken Evans, sir.
WHIP Call me Whip.
EVANS Yes sir.
WHIP studies this little Bible Thumper for a second before...
WHIP Margaret.
WHIP Sweetie, will you get me a coffee, black, lots of sugar.
WHIP And some aspirin.
WHIP You want something?
EVANS No ma'am.
EVANS Thank you.
EVANS Sir, it's 8:50.
WHIP Then let's push.
WHIP I got a great `on time' record.
EVANS Yes sir, you gottit.
EVANS And how you feeling today, sir?
WHIP focuses on EVANS, trying to read into that statement.
WHIP Tired, sir.
WHIP But, this is a quick turn for me.
WHIP Ten turns in three days.
WHIP Off tomorrow.
MARGARET returns with the coffee, placing it down near WHIP's chair on an airline cocktail napkin.
MARGARET Here's your coffee and the final manifest.
MARGARET 102 souls on board.
WHIP Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're a life saver.
WHIP And Margaret gettem' tucked in, we're ready to push.
WHIP goes to the head.
MARGARET and EVANS exchange a look.
NICOLE gets out of her Tercel and slams the door twice before it closes.
She checks the address on her phone and looks up at the enormous mansion.
NICOLE pushes through the overly tall front door of the house.
At first glance, it's completely empty, unfurnished.
A GUY in cargo pants and a baseball hat sleeps sitting up against the huge dual staircase that leads to the second floor.
Random boxes of video equipment are now evident as are thick cables that lead to a staircase going down.
On the staircase she immediately encounters another YOUNG CREW GUY holding a tiny lap dog while standing next to a NAKED GIRL wearing a Shakespearean Military Helmet.
The YOUNG CREW GUY holds up the "be quiet" finger to his lips.
NICOLE quietly makes her way down a few steps, stopping at the odd duo.
We now hear activity downstairs, music.
SUDDENLY the YOUNG CREW GUY frantically points at the NAKED
NAKED GIRL IN HELMET Othello you bastard!
And she grabs the TINY DOG and hustles downstairs.
NICOLE waits with the YOUNG CREW GUY until we hear....
NICOLE is free to walk all the way downstairs now.
NICOLE enters to reveal a large porn set with a Shakespearean theme, specifically "Othello."
We see an Elizabethan Four- poster bed with a canopy surrounded by stone arches and cardboard Venetian Columns.
In the bed we find an AFRICAN AMERICAN PORN ACTOR laying with TWO FEMALE ADULT ACTORS.
A GIRL WITH DYED-BLONDE HAIR stands naked next to the throne smoking a joint as she shaves her crotch with a man's electric razor.
NICOLE approaches a YOUNG TATTOOED MAN who only wears board shorts.
He's talking with an OLDER ASIAN MAN as they groom a pile of coke for snorting.
He sniffs a quick line and gets up to kiss her, she turns her cheek avoiding the coke-frozen kiss.
KIP Nicole, this is Tiki Pot.
KIP He's my partner in this new series, he knows a lot about porn.
NICOLE Kip I need 2 grams of "h."
KIP Tiki and I are trying to put the narrative back in porn.
KIP Our Desdemona hasn't shown yet.
KIP You should play Desdemona.
KIP FUCK YEAH!
KIP You got that fair skin.
KIP is flirting, seeing if she'll consider it...
NICOLE Desdemona?
NICOLE What the fuck?
TIKI does a line and comes up babbling.
TIKI POT She do anal, two thousand, one hour.
NICOLE I don't do porn, Kip.
NICOLE Just lemme see the "h."
KIP Just listen, we're doing an Othello theme where the Moor finds you in bed with your nurse and-
NICOLE He fucks me in the ass?
KIP Well...yeah.
KIP We're giving a whole new meaning to the "beast with two backs."
KIP That's actually a title we're toying with...'beast with two backs' or Hole-thelo or Butt Hole- thelo...would you be up for it?
TIKI POT College kid, very clean...BRETT?!
A tall thin kid joins them.
He wears a Moorish Headdress and has a bath towel wrapped around his waist.
TIKI POT (CONT'D) Show her the pipe-
BRETT drops the towel...
NICOLE Fuck you Tiki, you put that in your ass and call me in the morning.
NICOLE Kip, have I ever done that shit for you?
NICOLE Never.
NICOLE Asshole.
NICOLE walks away.
KIP follows her...at the door.
KIP Nic...sorry, we're tweaked, okay baby girl.
KIP Hey, c'mon you wanna stay and shoot some stills for me, you're pics are awesome.
KIP And what's going on with you?
KIP You were clean for a while and...
KIP Sweetheart, don't cry.
NICOLE I just need a little to smoke.
NICOLE I've got 100.
KIP pulls a small tin foil square from his vest pocket.
KIP No, keep your money, okay?
KIP But, Nicole, this is the Taliban baby, very big time.
KIP It will take you down.
NICOLE I can handle it.
KIP (CONT'D) Don't shoot this shit, it is way too heavy.
NICOLE I'm just gonna smoke it.
NICOLE I haven't done needles in weeks.
KIP Okay, no needles and take a little coke and if you start going down just whiff a little.
KIP Okay?
KIP I wanna see you...
KIP hands her a tiny baggy of coke.
He kisses her cheek.
Out the window...nothing...the rain pounds.
WHIP leans close to the windshield in an attempt to improve his view.
EVANS reaches down and throws a switch.
The windshield wipers go on.
We can now see very clearly the path of lights the plane is to follow.
WHIP looks to EVANS, smiles with stoned eyes.
WHIP Thanks junior.
EVANS looks out at the rain...
EVANS Looks pretty ugly, sir.
WHIP A little rain never hurt anybody.
WHIP We're not made of sugar.
WHIP What's the RVR?
EVANS Half a mile.
EVANS Right at minimums.
EVANS Wind's gusting to 29.
EVANS 30 is our crosswind max.
WHIP I know what our crosswind max is.
WHIP Tellem were good to go at the end.
EVANS just stares at WHIP.
GROUND CONTROL SouthJet 227, say intentions.
GROUND CONTROL WHIP looks right at EVANS.
GROUND CONTROL EVANS keys the radio.
EVANS Orlando ground.
EVANS SouthJet 227 will be ready to go at the end.
EVANS WHIP stares forward, not looking at EVANS.
INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY Nervous passengers stare out the windows as the JR-88 lumbers along the tarmac, headed for the runway.
INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY We follow TRINA whose ass looks as good in a tight navy skirt as it does split bare with orange fluorescence.
INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY MARGARET speaks into the PA mic.
MARGARET Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the seat-belt sign.
MARGARET Please be sure your seat-belts are securely fastened, and all carry-on items are safely stored in the over- head bin, or under the seat in front of you.
MARGARET Also, all personal electronic devices must be switched off, at this time.
MARGARET Today's flight time to Atlanta should be 52 minutes.
MARGARET Flight attendants please take your seats.
16 TRINA straps into her jump-seat.

INT. COCKPIT -- MORNING -- POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD Lightning FLASHES.
INT. COCKPIT -- MORNING -- POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD We watch the plane steer on to the GLOWING center-line.
INT. COCKPIT Whip inhales his coffee and readies himself for take-off.
INT. COCKPIT EVANS tries to relax, continuing with the checklist.
EVANS Elevator trim - set.
EVANS Flaps, One, two, three - set.
EVANS Radios - set.

12. Lights, pitot heat, de-ice - on.
12. Transponders, set.
TOWER SouthJet 227, wind is one-zero-zero at seventeen.
TOWER Runway 18L, cleared for take off.
WHIP has razor focus as he places his hand on the throttle.
EVANS sits upright and prepares for battle.
EVANS Cleared for take off, SouthJet 227.
Whip pushes the throttles and the engines SCREAM as they spool up to full thrust.
After a beat, he releases the brakes.
The passengers are pressed into their seats like blades of grass as the breeze of the plane's momentum moves them towards flight.
The main lights in the cabin go out and the small glow of the aisle lights lead us back to the cockpit.
WHIP mans the stick as he squints his eyes and tries to keep the nose between the lights of the runway.
WHIP It's like a video game, right?
WHIP laughs and turns to his copilot.
EVANS is visibly nervous as he begins the take-off check...
EVANS Airspeed's alive, both sides...
EVANS Engine instruments are in the green...100 knots crosscheck...
The JR-88 fishtails as the main gear begins to hydroplane.
WHIP Yep, nothing like a little 30 knot cross wind to exercise that sphincter muscle.
Evans is jostled violently.
EVANS That's wind shear!
EVANS A micro burst!
Whip's eyes are focused on the end of the runway.
The RED THRESHOLD LIGHTS are approaching fast.
The plane is not lifting off.
EVANS (CONT'D) Less than a thousand feet to go!
Whip snaps at him.
WHIP Just watch my airspeed!
C.U.
The airspeed indicator reads 145...
EVANS V1...and...
Now the air speed indicator climbs to 160...
EVANS (CONT'D) ...rotate.
Whip pulls back on the yoke, and...
The plane jerks up and we can hear the fuselage flex as we leave the ground.
The plane is immediately buffeted by severe turbulence.
EVANS (CONT'D) That's wind shear for sure!
WHIP Yeehaw!
WHIP Ride `em cowboy.
The passengers are rattled like a bag of marbles.
The plane is loping up as the rain continues to pound the windshield.
The ascent is very bumpy as the turbulent wind tosses the plane side to side.
Copilot EVANS is communicating with Air Traffic Control...
EVANS Orlando Departure...SouthJet 227, climbing out of 2500 for 5 thousand, runway heading.
ATC Roger SouthJet 227.
ATC Turn left heading one-seven-zero.
ATC Climb, maintain niner thousand.
EVANS Left to 170.
EVANS Climb, maintain niner thousand.
EVANS quickly dials the heading and altitude into the auto- pilot.
WHIP I don't want the auto-pilot.
WHIP I'm flying.
ATC What's your ride like, SouthJet
Before EVANS can answer, WHIP jumps on the radio.
WHIP Ah, Departure, we've got some rough chop here.
WHIP I'd say moderate to...
WHUMP!!
The plane hits a severe bump!
EVAN's headset turns sideways and he quickly rights it.
WHIP chokes back a nervous chuckle.
WHIP (CONT'D) No, severe.
WHIP (CONT'D) Definitely severe turbulence.
WHIP (CONT'D) No meal service today.
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL Roger that.
Whump!!
Once again the plane is violently rocked.
The passengers audibly HOWL as the roller coaster dip lifts most of their stomachs into their throats.
A few overhead luggage bins fly open and bags and coats rain down.
The THREE ATTENDANTS calmly collect the luggage and stow it in the kitchen.
They talk loudly for the benefit of the passengers.
TRINA This happened last week, always bumpy outta Orlando.
TRINA Right Cam?
MARGARET grabs the cabin mic and addresses the passengers.
MARGARET Ladies and Gentlemen, the captain has asked that until we clear this air you stay seated with your seat belts fastened.
MARGARET Thank you.
The plane rocks and shutters.
WHIP seems oblivious as he continues to serenade Evans.
WHIP Feelin' alright - Not feelin' too good myself - Feelin' alright - Not feelin' too good myself...
WHIP is interrupted by Air Traffic Control.
ATC SouthJet 227...Be advised there is a large convective cell four miles at your 11 o'clock.
ATC And another cell, 2 o'clock, 10 miles.
ATC Both moving rapidly.
EVANS Copy, Center.
EVANS Did you get that?
WHIP Gottit Skippy.
WHIP I'm just tryin' to get birdie here outta this wind bowl...What did they clear us to?
EVANS We're cleared to Flight Level one- eight-thousand.
EVANS' headset flies off.
His tie and all the loose equipment and coffee cups are thrown to the ground.
WHIP Goddamnit!
WHIP Enough of this shit!
WHIP pushes the yoke forward.
The plane pitches downward.
EVANS What are you doing!?
WHIP Leveling off.
EVANS What!?
WHIP points to the MFD screen.
WHIP See that sliver of blue sitting between those two ugly bastards?
C.U.
MFD screen: A narrow line of blue is visible between the two monstrous convective cells.
WHIP (CONT'D) That's a little pocket of smooth air squatting right over Lake Kissimmee...
EVANS nervously squints at the screen.
WHIP (CONT'D) And we're gonna thread that fucking needle.
WHIP (CONT'D) Turn me thirty degrees right!
EVANS jumps on the radio.
EVANS Center.
EVANS This is SouthJet 227, We need to divert 30 degrees right...
WHIP For weather.
EVANS ...for weather.
ATC SouthJet 227, this is Jacksonville Center.
ATC 30 Degrees, right, approved.
ATC Report back on course.
EVANS Report back on course.
WHIP banks the plane to the right.
Suddenly -- the plane falls 200 feet in 2 seconds.
A huge air pocket pulls the rug out from under the JR-88.
From the cockpit we can hear the passengers scream.
EVANS holds on to his headset.
EVANS (CONT'D) Oh, Lord!
WHIP He can't help you now, brother.
WHIP remains cool as he rides more bad air.
The plane now bounces rapidly over a non-stop succession of speed bumps.
The passengers clutch each other as they rattle like bobble head dolls; it's getting worse.
WHIP pushes the throttle and the 17-year-old Jackson- Ridgefield JR-88 accelerates directly into a huge black cloud.
He begins to dip the nose level to the ground.
EVANS Why are you leveling off, sir?
WHIP I'd like to spend less time in this shitty air, Kenny.
WHIP Is that alright with you?
WHIP pushes the 17-year-old Jackson-Ridgefield JR-88 directly into a huge black cloud.
He begins to dip the nose towards the ground.
EVANS We're approaching maximum airspeed!
WHIP Fucking right!
WHIP I'm gonna need some speed to punch through this crap.
The passengers howl in fear as the plane pitches forward.
EVANS calls out to WHIP...
EVANS You're over-speeding!
WHIP Not yet!!
The AIRSPEED INDICATOR moves from GREEN right up to the YELLOW line.
WHIP banks the plane steeply to the right.
From the cabin we HEAR the passengers SCREAM!
Now ATC comes on the radio...
ATC Uh, SouthJet 227, this is Jacksonville Center.
ATC Say altitude.
WHIP Tell `em we're climbing.
EVANS Center...uh...SouthJet 227 is leaving niner thousand...for Flight Level 180.
ATC SouthJet 227, this is Center.
ATC You need to check your Mode-C.
ATC Your transponder indicates you're descending.
EVANS looks at WHIP -- panicked.
WHIP You're useless Evans, shit!
19. Center.
19. This is SouthJet 227, we've encountered some bad air here.
19. Some pretty severe downdrafts.
19. We're in our climb now.
ATC Roger.
The shaking gets incredibly violent.
WE HEAR SCREAMS from the cabin.
Evans points to Whip's airspeed indicator.
EVANS Look at your airspeed!
EVANS You're too fast for this rough air!
WHIP I'm right on the line Kenny.
WHIP Right on the line.
WHIP starts to hum the Joe Cocker song again as he cranes his head up close to the windscreen -- looking intently at the dark sky.
WHIP (CONT'D) C'mon sweetheart, show me the sun.
Suddenly, we see a beam of light breaking through the black clouds -- 12 o'clock high.
A God ray.
WHIP (cont'd) (CONT'D) Finally, daylight.
WHIP banks the plane hard, lifting the nose -- pointing it directly at the crack in the darkness.
He shoves the throttles to full power.
The plane is banking, rising and accelerating.
The screaming passengers go quiet with the strange new development.
The shaking has eased from a 10 to a 5.
Whip keeps the plane climbing steeply.
The Vertical Speed Indicator shows we're ascending 2,000 feet per minute.
The altimeter spins up past 12,000 ft.
The murky grey outside becomes lighter and brighter, until suddenly, in a dramatic reveal...
Instantly the air becomes perfectly smooth.
Whip levels off and maneuvers between the two towering cloud walls -- smooth as silk.
Gliding over the fluffy white clouds and through the shimmering rays of the sun -- it feels like WHIP just flew the JR-88 into heaven.
A joyous CHEER ERUPTS from the passenger cabin
WHIP pulls the power back and switches on the auto-pilot.
EVANS is cheery, almost giddy...
EVANS Glad that's over.
WHIP, however, is very shaky and beaded with sweat.
WHIP How tall are we?
EVANS 16 thousand.
EVANS That was incredible sir...
WHIP Ken, turn us north and take us home.
WHIP Your plane.
EVANS looks at him and nods.
EVANS My plane.
WHIP Margaret, I'm coming out.
WHIP hangs up, puts on his pilot hat and exits the cockpit.
NICOLE has her keys out as she hustles for her door.
She looks to find the door slightly open.
She pushes it fully open to see FRAN, the building manager, standing in her living room holding her camera.
He tries to be casual...
FRAN Where you been Nicole?
She is scared and pissed by his invasion of her space.
NICOLE Fuck!
NICOLE Fran...get out.
FRAN You're like a little ghost.
FRAN I never know when you're here.
NICOLE Get the fuck out Fran!
She grabs the full-bodied 35 MM camera from him.
FRAN As the building manager I have a legal right to enter an apartment if I believe the occupant is unwell.
FRAN Especially if said occupant is not current on her rent.
He takes a slimy step towards her.
She steps away.
NICOLE Fran, please just gimme a minute.
NICOLE Get out.
NICOLE I have the rent.
NICOLE I will bring it down to you.
NICOLE Just let me shower.
FRAN You could just bring the check down now, use my shower.
FRAN I got good water pressure.
FRAN You know that...
FRAN leans against the door frame, trying to strike a seductive pose.
NICOLE smiles and holds up her camera.
NICOLE You're in the perfect light Fran.
NICOLE Back up a little...little more.
FRAN steps outside and on to the landing.
NICOLE kicks the door shut and locks it, escaping FRAN who calls through the door.
FRAN Tricky tricky, girl.
FRAN Alright, so you shower up and come down.
FRAN For real.
FRAN We don't gotta talk about the check.
FRAN Hang out a lil bit...
NICOLE puts her camera down gently on the table.
NICOLE In your fucking dreams.
She now flings her purse on the ground in frustration...the contents spill on to the carpet.
Amidst the flotsam we focus on yet another candy tin that springs open.
NICOLE fixes her stare at the hypodermic needle resting inside.
WHIP exits the lavatory drying his hands with a towel.
He looks down the aisle to see TRINA far down the cabin.
TRINA sees WHIP, comes back up the aisle and stands with her back to him watching the passengers.
WHIP opens a bottle of orange juice and takes a big swig.
He then pours half of it in the sink.
WHIP places the open juice bottle on the liquor cart, reaches up, and grabs the cabin mic to address the passengers.
WHIP Folks, this is Captain Whitaker.
WHIP If you look up, I'm here in the galley.
WHIP I will wave to you.
WHIP steps into the aisle so the passengers can see him.
WHIP waves with a calm smile that would put anyone at ease.
WHIP (CONT'D) Good Morning.
WHIP (CONT'D) I apologize for the bumps, but Florida just doesn't seem to like us Georgians.
WHIP (CONT'D) Must be the beatin' the Bulldogs put on the Gators last fall.
Titters of laughter from the passengers as WHIP moves the half step he needs to put himself behind the liquor cart.
WHIP (CONT'D) Stretch out and relax.
WHIP (CONT'D) The air might stay a little cranky so I'm gonna ask that you sit tight if you can, with your seat belts fastened.
We now watch from behind WHIP as his free hand reaches into the top drawer of the liquor cart and pulls three small vodka bottles out.
WHIP (CONT'D) We won't have beverage service but the girls will walk through with water and snacks and I'll have you in Atlanta in about 40 minutes.
WHIP (CONT'D) Thank you.
WHIP puts the mic to its hook.
Alone in the galley and out of view, he quickly empties the vodkas into the orange juice bottle and replaces the cap.
Whip shakes the juice as he tosses the little empties into the galley trash.
Whip takes a healthy pull from the spiked juice, downing nearly half.
WHIP knocks on the cockpit door.
MARGARET emerges and WHIP disappears in to the cockpit.
Framed photos on a bureau show: Christmas around the tree with Mom (30) and Dad (33) and a girl who's 8 and a boy who's 5.
(In the reflection of this photo we see a flame cooking heroin in a spoon.)
Another photo depicts an 8 year-old girl's birthday party.
A last photo shows NICOLE (30)and her mom (54).
They are both wearing kerchiefs.
We can see that her mom is gaunt and has no hair under her kerchief.
(In the reflection of this photo we see the needle injected into her arm.)
A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE is placed in front of that picture.
Next to the photos is a small CD station that NICOLE taps to life and turns up.
The opening bars of Michael Fitzpatrick's "Medication" begin to play.
We pull wide to see NICOLE pull the bra from her arm that she used to tie off with.
Her face is pure happiness.
Clothes and a peach crate filled with camera equipment join a suitcase on its side that acts as a coffee table.
NICOLE picks up her camera and admires it before putting it down.
She picks up the cigarette she had staged pre dope fix and reaches for the lighter.
She laughs and hums, pulls out gum, a brush...She's holding the brush when the first heavy wave of narcotic death washes over her.
She leans back and uses the wall for support.
"Medication" is hitting its chorus...
NICOLE Oh man...
She puts her arms out at her sides, euphoria.
A slow, sloppy smile breaks across her face.
She exhales slowly.
She reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave of heavy drugs hits.
NICOLE looks up with fear.
NICOLE (cont'd) (CONT'D) Oh no, oh no, oh no...
She reaches for the little bag of coke that KIP gave her.
Next she grabs her phone, flipping it open.
As she tries to dial it, she crumbles to her knees.
NICOLE somewhat controls her fall to the ground, but her eyes are fading.
The little bag of coke falls from her fingers.
There's no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose.
NICOLE's arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks to the floor.
On her back like a girl making angels in the snow as her eyelids flutter, she slips away.
We hear a pounding on the door.
FRAN is on the other side...
FRAN Open up, Nicole!
FRAN I can smell that shit cooking!
FRAN Open Up!
FRAN Nicole.
FRAN Nicole!
WHIP is now passed out in the seat next to EVANS.
He has two approach plates (charts) folded and tucked between his sunglasses and eyes, creating a makeshift sleeping mask.
His lower jaw hangs open as his head bobs in deep sleep.
Margaret leans in through the cockpit door talking to Evans.
MARGARET How long has Sleeping Beauty been out?
EVANS maintains a military posture as he monitors the plane's progress.
The flight is smooth and the sky appears clear.
EVANS 26 minutes.
EVANS We're going to start descending any second now.
MARGARET Well, I guess you'll need to wake...
The radio interrupts...
ATC SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center.
ATC Descend and maintain Flight Level 30 thousand.
EVANS Descend and maintain 30 thousand.
Evans dials 30,000 into the auto-pilot, but just as he rolls the thumb switch to the "Descend" position...
Instantly the autopilot's Shut-Off SOUNDS.
WHIP jolts awake and pushes up his sleeping "shades."
WHIP The fuck was that?
Evans grabs his yoke and pulls.
EVANS The stabilizer feels really stiff.
WHIP Don't force it.
EVANS does, we HEAR a big mechanical SNAP.
MARGARET That came from the back!
EVANS I have very little trim control sir.
WHIP Margaret, get everybody strapped in tight.
Margaret runs to the PA, leaving the cockpit door open.
EVANS It's pulling right.
EVANS Hard!
WHIP Shit!
WHIP It's locked up, ease up on the trim don't...
EVANS I have no trim at all!
The instrument panel LIGHTS UP like a Christmas tree -- A
WHIP We lost our hydraulics!
WHIP pulls on his headset and keys his mic.
WHIP (CONT'D) Center, this is SouthJet 227, we've lost our hydraulics...and, ah shit!
WHIP (CONT'D) Power.
WHIP (CONT'D) Pull back the power!
Evans pulls the throttles to idle.
WHIP (CONT'D) ...we lost hydraulics and looks like...also our horizontal stabilizer.
ATC SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center.
ATC Understand you've lost hydraulics and stabilizer?
WHIP Turn on the back-up pumps!
Evans engages the emergency hydraulic pumps.
WHIP (CONT'D) Center, that's affirm.
WHIP (CONT'D) We are in a descent, an uncontrolled...
The plane starts to bank to the right, WHIP puts his hand against the wing-window to stay in his seat.
EVANS grabs his harness with both hands.
The passengers shriek with terror.
ATC SouthJet 227, do you wish to declare an emergency!?
MARGARET stumbles into the cockpit.
MARGARET Everyone's belted in.
MARGARET Are we going down?
The plane suddenly pitches up, begins to roll, and dives again.
WHIP Get belted in, everyone belt in.
WHIP Brace position!
MARGARET rushes to the bench in the galley.
Whip grabs his yoke and pulls.
The plane inches up.
WHIP (CONT'D) I've got some control on my side!
WHIP (CONT'D) My plane!
EVANS Your plane.
Whips keeps back pressure on his yoke.
EVANS (CONT'D) It's stiff as hell.
EVANS (CONT'D) We're pitching up.
EVANS (CONT'D) Slowing a bit.
ATC SouthJet 227, say your condition.
Whip continues to give orders to Evans.
WHIP We need drag.
WHIP Throw out everything we've got.
WHIP Speed brakes.
WHIP Gear...
WHIP Uh, Center we're in a dive...lost vertical control.
ATC SouthJet 227, Roger.
Evans deploys the landing gear and applies the speed brakes.
The wind ROARS as the gear doors drop.
The airframe shakes and rumbles violently.
WHIP ...there enough hydraulics to drop the gear?
EVANS Gear's down.
EVANS I don't think hydraulics is the problem.
WHIP Throw out the flaps.
EVANS Too fast for flaps.
WHIP We need to start dumping fuel.
Evans hesitates.
WHIP (CONT'D) Do it!
Evans quickly throws the "EMRG FUEL DUMP" switch.
The airplane bucks and drops violently -- A chorus of terrified SCREAMS ERUPTS from the main cabin.
Whip pulls on his yoke with all of his strength and the dive shallows out a bit.
ATC SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center.
ATC How do you hear?
WHIP Atlanta.
WHIP This is SouthJet 227.
WHIP We are in an uncontrolled dive, descending out of...shit I don't know...
EVANS 21 thousand!
WHIP ...21 thousand.
WHIP We are declaring an emergency!
WHIP We are dumping fuel!
WHIP We have a jammed stabilizer...or something.
WHIP We need a block of altitude to work the problem...and a heading to the nearest airport!
WHIP I'm starting to lose it!
The yoke pressure pulls Whip hard against his harness.
ATC SouthJet 227.
ATC Hartsfield-Jackson International is 10 O'clock and 20 miles from your present position.
ATC Maintain block altitude, Flight Level 10 thousand through Flight Level 20 thousand.
ATC Turn left heading 260.
WHIP 260...we'll do our best.
WHIP It's getting away from me!
WHIP I can't hold...dump the flaps!
EVANS We're still fast.
The yoke is ripping away from Whip's hands.
WHIP DO IT!
WHIP 30 percent!
Evans dumps in the flaps.
The JR-88 slows dramatically and balloons up.
WHIP (CONT'D) That bought us a little time.
WHIP (CONT'D) We need to revert to manual control.
WHIP (CONT'D) Your side first, pul...
Whip is interrupted by the radio.
ATC SouthJet 227, Atlanta.
ATC Fuel dump is approved.
WHIP Thank you.
Evans is confused and panicked, he throws his hands up.
WHIP (CONT'D) Evans, look at me!
WHIP (CONT'D) Manual Reversion.
WHIP (CONT'D) Red lever, on the floor, far side of the console.
Evans sees it.
EVANS I got it.
WHIP Pull it up, turn it clockwise, push it back down.
Evans does exactly that, then pulls back on his yoke -- nothing!
EVANS Nothing!
EVANS No control!
WHIP Goddamn it!!
Once again, the plane pitches into a dive.
Whip strains to hold on.
WHIP (CONT'D) I can't let go!
WHIP (CONT'D) Can you reach mine?
Evans strains to reach Whip's Reversion Pull-Handle -- but can't.
EVANS I can't reach it.
Evans moves to release his harness, but Whip stops him.
WHIP No!
WHIP Don't!
WHIP Stay strapped in!
WHIP Margaret!
WHIP Margaret!
Margaret tumbles into the cockpit, catching herself on Whip's chair.
She's crying.
MARGARET Oh God, Whip.
MARGARET What's happening?!
WHIP Get strapped into the jump-seat.
WHIP I need your help.
Margaret opens the jump-seat and starts to pull on her harness.
Throughout the scene she is struggling with her harness.
WHIP (CONT'D) Margaret, see that red lever on the floor next to my chair?
WHIP (CONT'D) The one that says, Manual Control?
MARGARET Yes.
WHIP On the count of three you pull it up, turn it clockwise, then push it back down.
WHIP OK?
WHIP You ready?
With tears streaming down her cheeks, she gives Whip a brave nod.
WHIP (CONT'D) Here we go.
WHIP (CONT'D) One, two...
Whip releases back pressure from his yoke, pushing it forward -- the plane noses downward 20 degrees!
WHIP (CONT'D) ...three!
MORE TERRIFIED SHRIEKS come from the back.
Margaret quickly disengages then re-engages the large red handle.
Whip pulls back on his yoke.
The plane pitches up.
WHIP (CONT'D) Ok.
WHIP (CONT'D) OK.
WHIP (CONT'D) We got something.
WHIP (CONT'D) It's still stiff as hell.
WHIP (CONT'D) Evans, put in some power!
Evans pushes up the throttles.
Whip gingerly applies pressure to his stick.
His face fills with worry.
WHIP (CONT'D) I don't know.
WHIP (CONT'D) It feels like the son of a bitch wants to nose over.
Then suddenly...
WHAP!
Whip's yoke flies out of his hands and SLAMS forward!
The plane banks right and drops!
Margaret SCREAMS!
Now, ATC comes on the radio...
ATC SouthJet 227, Hartsfield-Jackson is eleven o'clock and niner miles.
ATC I see you below 10,000.
ATC How are you doing?
WHIP Not good.
WHIP You got anything closer?
WHIP We're in a rapid dive here...
ATC Roger, SouthJet 227.
ATC Uh...Clayton County is 2 miles at your 4 o'clock.
WHIP Negative.
WHIP We're too high...we can't pitch for glide.
WHIP We have no stabilizer control.
ATC Copy, SouthJet 227.
The plane continues to drop, increasing its nose-down attitude and speed.
WHIP pushes both of his feet forward, stretching his body to get leverage as we can see him pulling on the yoke, trying to get the plane out of the dive it's in.
Evans is starting to lose it.
EVANS Oh Lord, we're descending at 4,700 feet per minute, out of 7,000.
WHIP OK!
WHIP Here's what we're going to do!
WHIP When I say, you retract the gear, retract the flaps and trim both ailerons.
WHIP But every things gonna be opposite, so be sure to trim down.
WHIP Margaret...
EVANS Trim down?!
EVANS What are you gonna do?!
Whip takes Margaret's hand and puts it on the throttle levers.
WHIP When I ask for power, push both of these forward.
WHIP Got it?
WHIP What's your son's name?
MARGARET Trevor.
WHIP Say "I love you Trevor."
EVANS You mean trim up?!
EVANS Right?
EVANS You want me to trim up?
MARGARET Why?
WHIP The black box.
MARGARET I love you Trevor.
MARGARET Be a good boy.
MARGARET Mommy loves you.
EVANS What are we doing?!
EVANS Why would I trim down?!
WHIP We're gonna roll it.
WHIP Ready?
WHIP Here we go.
WHIP I've got control.
WHIP Just a little barrel roll.
WHIP Don't panic.
WHIP Relax.
WHIP Let it roll.
WHIP's body is fully extended as he pulls back on the yoke and turns into a steep bank.
The G-force of the roll presses Evans away from the console.
WHIP Margaret!
WHIP Can you reach it?
Margaret bends forward and pulls the lever.
EVANS 3,000...I think.
WHIP Let it roll.
WHIP I got it!
Whip quickly retracts the speed brakes, then PUSHES HIS YOKE FULL FORWARD!
The clumsy liner does a slow, ungraceful roll.
WE WATCH as the PASSENGERS scream as the plane rolls over and they are suspended upside down.
The JR-88 finishes its barrel-roll, skimming over suburban rooftops and trees.
A CLOUD-TRAIL of Jet-A SPEWING from its wings.
As the INVERTED PLANE ROARS overhead the CAMERA PANS to find -
Being rushed out of her apartment on a stretcher.
The TWO PARAMEDICS and Fran (the landlord) instinctively duck as the jet SCREAMS over.
FRAN Jesus Christ!
FRAN What the Fuck!?
EVANS hangs in his harness straps as dust and smoke swirl around him.
The inverted wings make an EERIE WHISTLING SOUND as the plane SHUDDERS violently side-to-side.
EVANS Oh Lord Jesus!
EVANS We're inverted!
WHIP reaches over and pulls the throttles back.
He suddenly seems strangely calm, comfortable with his fate...
WHIP We're level.
WHIP We can maintain altitude like this.
TRINA struggles to stay in her seat as she looks at the passengers hanging.
She watches as a YOUNG BOY loses his grip and flops to the ground.
TRINA unhooks and flops to the ground.
We follow her as she runs on the ceiling of the cabin towards the BOY.
She gets there and starts lifting him towards his FATHER.
The ATC voice now plays loudly through the entire cockpit.
ATC SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center.
ATC I see your position 4 and a half miles southeast of the airport.
ATC Descending out of 1,800.
ATC Are you
It takes Whip a second to find the mic key on his inverted yoke...
WHIP Uh, Atlanta...we're inverted.
There's a very pregnant pause...
ATC Uh, SouthJet 227...say again sir.
ATC Did you say inverted?
EVANS seems calmed by WHIP'S workaday attitude about their insane tragedy.
But suddenly...
WE HEAR A HORRIBLE, METALLIC GRINDING SOUND as the engines become oil-deprived.
WHIP We're flying!
Evans pulls the Fire Bottle handle.
Whip BARKS at air traffic control.
ATC 227, three miles, and one o'clock.
WHIP We're not gonna make that!
A small white church on a hill -- 100 yards past the church is a soy bean field and a two-lane blacktop.
WHIP (CONT'D) There's a field and a road ah...we're gonna put it down in that field.
ATC Roger, SouthJet 227.
EVANS is breathing heavy as his face is beet red from the blood rushing to it.
Evans deploys the right engine Fire Bottle.
ATC Eight hundred, descending...
WHIP We have enough speed to fly!
STARTS TO RIGHT ITSELF.
Whip yanks back the throttles!
Evans and Whip deploy every bit of drag they can think of.
ATC SouthJet 227, altitude 500 indicated, descending.
ATC Do you concur?
We follow WHIP's eye line that takes us off the control panel and to the windshield.
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD WE SEE -- the landscape and the church steeple getting closer and closer.
The plane does a clumsy roll to the right -- AND GETS STUCK
EVANS pushes the power to full thrust AND THE PLANE FINISHES
TRINA is still struggling to strap herself in to her jumpseat.
The plane rolls!
She sees Camelia...
P.O.V.
-- Camelia is tossed across a row of SCREAMING passengers.
TRINA loses her grip and is violently thrown against the galley wall!
Like a rag doll, CAMELIA is hurled down the cabin aisle as the plane plummets!
Trina slides across the galley floor and CRACKS her head on the jumpseat.
Whip frantically spins the trim wheel!
WE HEAR A HORRIFIC, METALLIC GRINDING -- followed by a
An unnerving quiet descends over the passenger cabin.
The only SOUND is the wind RUSHING past the air-frame.
WHIP Are we gliding?
GATHERED NEAR A POND IN THE CHURCHYARD SCATTER -- some are wearing long white robes.
EVANS Oh God.
And in a final, ironic, cosmic gesture --
WE SEE Whip's lower torso being pulled from the wreckage -- There is swirling SMOKE AND DUST, SMALL FIRES --
Evans strapped in his chair, bleeding --
Margaret SOBS uncontrollably --
WHIP's being pulled up a grassy hillside.
In the distance WHIP can see the shattered airplane lying in a crater.
Fires smoulder around the impact zone.
Passengers are joined by first responders as they frantically carry, drag and walk the injured and the dead from the plane.
WHIP sees a fire truck fly by him, down the grassy slope towards the burning plane.
LOOKING UP at the sky -- WE SEE black, oily SMOKE billowing across the shattered church steeple --
WE GLIMPSE PEOPLE rushing past, some are wearing white flowing robes --
LOOKING UP at the ceiling of an ambulance --
TWO EMTS are urgently attending to him --
A halogen overhead light and an air-conditioning vent -- brown-stained acoustic ceiling tiles --
WE HEAR the rhythmic BEEP of a heart monitor --
WHIP's eyes open to see the halogen overhead lights of a hospital room.
He turns his head slightly to see the flicker of a TV with no sound.
A news show runs a loop of eye witness cell phone footage of the plane turning over and crashing belly down.
A MAN who has been watching the TV turns to see that WHIP is awake.
The MAN turns off the TV, gets up and approaches WHIP's bedside.
WHIP knows him.
WHIP Charlie Anderson.
CHARLIE ANDERSON is a late 50's former military pilot who carries that familiar air of Texas comfort and entitlement.
CHARLIE How you feelin' Whip?
CHARLIE Initial reports look like you pulled some move up there, kid.
CHARLIE You saved a lot of lives.
WHIP is moved by the first realization of survival.
WHIP How many?
CHARLIE moves close to deliver the news.
CHARLIE 102 souls on board including the flight crew, and 96 of them survived the crash.
CHARLIE Six people died.
CHARLIE 2 crew, 4 passengers.
WHIP 4 passengers.
WHIP Are the rest badly hurt?
WHIP Who'd we lose on the crew?
A NURSE enters the room.
CHARLIE nods to her.
CHARLIE Listen, protocol is the NTSB has to make the first contact with you and the agent is here.
CHARLIE Let me go get him.
CHARLIE ducks out of the room.
WHIP is alone and still getting his bearings.
He goes to scratch his head and catches sight of his left hand.
It's swollen and sore --his wrist is bandaged with a splint-brace.
He now looks at both of his hands in wonder.
WHIP hears a muffled conversation that gets clearer as do the images of MANY PEOPLE entering the room.
A POLICE OFFICER accompanies a DOCTOR and TWO NTSB AGENTS.
An NTSB AGENT holds a small voice recorder towards WHIP.
NTSB OFFICER #1 Captain William Whitaker?
NTSB OFFICER #1 Nod if you can hear me and understand me.
NTSB OFFICER #1 I'm Craig Matson from the NTSB and I'm required as the lead on the Go Team to make an initial contact with you after a major incident like the one you had today.
WHIP nods as his senses are getting sharper.
NTSB OFFICER #1 (CONT'D) You are in a hospital in South Atlanta.
NTSB OFFICER #1 (CONT'D) Are you aware that you were piloting a plane that went down?
NTSB OFFICER #1 (CONT'D) I have a doctor here who can explain your medical situation.
WHIP offers a "thumbs up" gesture.
The DOCTOR steps in.
DOCTOR I'm Doctor Kenan and the good news is that you are in good condition.
DOCTOR You did suffer a concussion which is the reason you have a bit of blurred vision and a headache.
DOCTOR You have numerous lacerations around your left eye.
DOCTOR We're going to leave the patch on for a few days as a precaution.
DOCTOR But it seems your eye is OK.
DOCTOR MRI's show strained tendons in your left knee and ankle but you didn't break any bones.
43. You have some deep bruising in your left thigh and you have a few torn ligaments in your left wrist.
43. Nothing serious.
43. So as soon as we clear you from the concussion, and you feel well enough -- you can go home.
43. That could be a day, could be 3 days.
43. Okay?
WHIP quietly nods.
The DOCTOR leaves and WHIP begins to study his body.
His left leg is wrapped, his left wrist has a splint-brace --
NTSB OFFICER #1 I won't ask too much of you tonight, but as I said, the NTSB is required to make initial contact.
NTSB OFFICER #1 How much do you remember about the flight?
WHIP looks at the NTSB OFFICER and slowly speaks.
WHIP I remember everything until the crash.
WHIP's voice is failing him as his throat is sore and dry.
NTSB OFFICER #1 Okay Mr. Whitaker, that's fine.
NTSB OFFICER #1 I am required to inform you that this incident did result in the loss of life.
NTSB OFFICER #1 The most current information states that of the 102 souls on board we lost 6.
NTSB OFFICER #1 2 crew members and 4 passengers.
NTSB OFFICER #1 59 people were treated and released.
NTSB OFFICER #1 37 people remain in the hospital and 3 of those cases are listed as critical.
WHIP Who on the crew died?
NTSB OFFICER #1 Two flight attendants;
NTSB OFFICER #1 Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez
WHIP tries to exhale as the loss of TRINA sinks in.
NTSB OFFCIER #1 The rep from your Pilot's Union, Mr. Anderson, will act as our contact for you.
NTSB OFFCIER #1 It's important to follow your Union's guidance on press and media.
NTSB OFFCIER #1 The pilot's union works closely with the NTSB.
NTSB OFFCIER #1 So, I'm gonna head out.
NTSB OFFCIER #1 Good luck Mr.
NTSB OFFCIER #1 Whitaker.
WHIP nods as the NTSB OFFICER leaves with the police and other officials in tow.
CHARLIE returns to WHIP's side.
WHIP I knew Trina Marquez.
WHIP We spent some time together.
CHARLIE Apparently she wasn't strapped in.
CHARLIE A survivor reported that she was assisting a kid.
CHARLIE tries to put a reassuring hand on WHIP's shoulder.
WHIP How's Margaret Thomason?
CHARLIE Broken collar bone, cuts, banged up, but she's okay.
CHARLIE She's here too.
CHARLIE Ken Evans your copilot took a bad shot to the head.
CHARLIE They're keepin' him in a coma to let the brain swelling go down.
CHARLIE He's listed as critical, but we feel good about him.
CHARLIE He's gonna be okay.
WHIP lets that information land as his head is swirling.
WHIP Charlie, why are you here?
CHARLIE I'm flying a desk now.
CHARLIE I'm a regional rep for the IAP.
WHIP You're the rep for the pilots' union?
CHARLIE I'm one of a few union reps for the southeast.
CHARLIE When your plane went down all the reps got a page and since I know you I shot my hand up and said I wanted to come and be the first face you'd see.
WHIP I'm glad it's you.
WHIP starts to weep as he needs to begin the long process of expressing this trauma.
CHARLIE It's good to see you too, Cowboy.
CHARLIE You're gonna be okay.
CHARLIE We're gonna take care of you.
CHARLIE That's my job.
WHIP nods as he wipes his eyes on his heavily bandaged hand.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) The union will put out a statement on your behalf.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Condolences to the families who lost loved ones and gratitude to the brave men and women on the flight crew.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) And I know you and Deana have been divorced for a while but maybe she and your son...?
WHIP Yeah, Knuckles.
CHARLIE Yeah, how old's he now?
CHARLIE Wow, you weren't even married when we flew for Delta.
CHARLIE We're dinosaurs, Whip.
CHARLIE Do you want me to reach out to Deana and see if she and Will want to come?
CHARLIE Any family you want here, we'll get them here, stat.
WHIP thinks about his long since fractured family...
WHIP No, I'll call her.
CHARLIE Speaking of which, I have your phone and some of your personal effects from the plane.
CHARLIE has a zip-locked bag with his phone, keys, sunglasses and wallet.
WHIP looks at them, odd to see them encased in plastic.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Your clothes are toast.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Do you need me to get you some stuff?
WHIP No, I'm okay.
WHIP I'll take care of it.
CHARLIE I'm gonna head out, let you get some rest.
CHARLIE I'm coming back.
CHARLIE You'll see plenty of me.
CHARLIE hands WHIP his card.
WHIP Thanks Charlie, I really...
WHIP It means a lot to me that you came.
CHARLIE Okay.
CHARLIE Get some rest now.
WHIP Charlie, that plane was fucked.
CHARLIE I know.
CHARLIE The way you landed that plane was nothing short of a miracle.
WHIP nods trying to pull it together.
CHARLIE pats WHIP's shoulder before he leaves.
WHIP sits up and pulls his phone from the plastic bag.
Dials, waits...
WHIP Harling...Harling...yeah, it's Whip.
WHIP I'm in a hospital in South Atlanta...what?
WHIP You know where I am?
WHIP Okay well fuck...yeah, I'm okay.
WHIP What?
WHIP Well, I'm looking to get outta here...hopefully tomorrow.
WHIP Yeah.
WHIP But, listen, I need you to bring me something to wear.
47. I don't know -- clothes -- and smokes, I really need smokes.
47. Tee shirt, sweat pants....Harling?
47. I'll put you on the visiting list.
47. Yeah...and smokes.
47. Just be low key, no fucking around, Harling.
47. Cigarettes.
47. Okay?
47. I need cigarettes.
47. Yeah.
47. Good.
WHIP closes his eyes and exhales.
He now stares at the foot of the bed for a long, long moment.
WHIP squeezes his eyes shut tight -- holding back tears.
Then quietly, as if whispering a prayer...
WHIP (CONT'D) Goddamn it...
The Stones "Sympathy for the Devil" kicks up as we wait...
The doors split open and HARLING MAYS steps out.
HARLING has a pony tail and a goatee and is probably wearing a Tommy Bahama button down shirt.
We follow HARLING as he strides down the hall.
With ear buds in, HARLING points a Sanyo pistol-shaped cam corder at the ATTENDING NURSE at the nurses' station, recording her...
HARLING MAYS I'm on the list baby girl.
HARLING MAYS Check the list for Mr. Mays.
HARLING MAYS Harling.
The Stones continue to wail as Harling strolls on, adjusting the duffel bag he has slung over his shoulder.
HARLING stands in the doorway looking in.
He sees...
The MORNING NURSE is helping WHIP to stand.
HARLING points his camcorder at WHIP and the NURSE.
HARLING MAYS (O.C.) If this is gonna turn into a sponge bath, I'll come back.
HARLING immediately goes to WHIP and supports him.
WHIP It's okay, Harling.
HARLING MAYS That's right honey, I'm on the list.
HARLING MAYS Harling Mays.
HARLING MAYS Some say they Harling knew me.
HARLING boxes her out.
She steps away.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Honey can you hustle us a couple of daiquiris and a cocktail weenie?
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) On second thought just bring the booze.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) I brought my own weenie.
No reaction as the NURSE collects the trash and towels.
HARLING focuses his camcorder on the NURSE and leaves WHIP in an unsteady stance.
HARLING films her and comments...
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) She's offended, and she should be.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) I'm a pig.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) And I hate me.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) That's what we have in common Nurse Ratched...we both hate me.
And she's gone.
HARLING turns to WHIP.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Whip?
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) What the fuck my man?
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) They're sayin', "Sweet Jesus, what a fuckin' stud that pilot is."
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) You're a hero, no shit.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) You will never pay for another drink in this life time.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) There is crazy news people all over, look at this shit--
HARLING helps WHIP to the window...
From WHIP's window we can see a slew of news vans with signal towers as well as reporters milling about -- a small zoo.
HARLING and WHIP stare for a moment at the circus below.
WHIP doesn't last long and slowly returns to the bed as HARLING continues to gawk.
HARLING MAYS Classic hero worship, you're a rock star man.
HARLING MAYS You gotta see the video I've got -- I'm making a doc about you, well us, y'know?
HARLING pulls an iPad out of his knapsack and flips it open.
He lets a collection of videos run...
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) This is outside your condo...
On HARLING's iPad we see footage of PRESS swarming outside WHIP's condo.
We also see the crash scene footage.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Look that's me, and that`s Mark Mellon...you know that douchey talking haircut from local Atlanta channel 3?
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) I said a few words.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Just straight talk, y'know?
WHIP's hands shake as he grabs the bed frame.
HARLING takes notice and stashes the iPad...
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) You okay Captain Whitaker?
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Easy...
HARLING helps him get settled.
We see the beads of sweat on WHIP's lip and forehead.
WHIP The meds they're giving me are fucking me up -- I'm all shaky and dried out.
WHIP I can't sleep good.
HARLING immediately picks up the small paper cup that holds WHIP's pain meds.
He fishes out the two pills and stares at them.
HARLING shakes his head.
HARLING MAYS Aprazolam?
HARLING MAYS That's generic Xanax and this Hydrocodone is generic Vicodin.
HARLING MAYS It's shit, prolly Canadian.
HARLING casually tosses the pills down his gullet and expertly swallows them without water.
He grabs WHIP's medical chart and scours it as he prattles on...
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) We want the premium stuff.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Blue label...not the fucking well shit.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Where's the dihydromorphinone?
50. Or just some fucking Palladone would suffice.
50. What is this?
50. Fucking amateur hour over here?
50. Get that goddamned doctor in here.
50. You just saved a 100 people from death, they should get your fuckin' meds right.
WHIP Listen Harling, leave it alone.
WHIP So you got my message and decided not to call me back?
WHIP Did you bring me smokes?
HARLING MAYS I decided to come by instead.
HARLING MAYS And yes I got your fucking message and yes I brought you smokes.
HARLING hands WHIP a pack of smokes from his pocket.
He also pulls out a carton of smokes from his backpack.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Here is a fresh carton, enjoy.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) You fucking earned it -- you smoke your nuts off, champion.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) If I were you I'd fire up right here in the God damn room.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Fuck'em, you're immortal, you're a fucking God man.
WHIP Harling...
WHIP motions with his hands to "calm down."
HARLING MAYS Sorry Whip.
HARLING MAYS It's just...this is big time, man.
HARLING MAYS You're a hero in a time when we really need heroes.
WHIP Shut the fuck up, Harling...Six people died.
HARLING MAYS 96 people lived!
HARLING MAYS When are you gonna take yes for an answer?
HARLING MAYS Pick up the phone, man.
HARLING MAYS Fuck.
HARLING pulls something from his vest pocket and puts it in WHIP'S hand.
WHIP looks at it and back at HARLING.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Here's a pint of Smirnoff and a few Red Bulls.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) You know what I'm sayin'?
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) I know my customer.
HARLING continues to pull items from the bag.
WHIP Harling, take the vodka with you.
HARLING freezes his frenzied energy with this odd command.
HARLING MAYS What?!
HARLING MAYS Take the vodka?
HARLING MAYS Dude, are you insane?
HARLING MAYS I'm gonna just tuck it in the bottom of your-
WHIP Take the fucking vodka!
HARLING hears him this time and raises his hand and nods, putting the VODKA back in his own duffel.
HARLING tosses a tee shirt, sweat pants and flip-flops on the bed, then...
HARLING MAYS Okay man.
HARLING MAYS Check it out.
HARLING holds up a silk Japanese Happi Coat, with elaborate stitching depicting colorful birds flying around Mt.
Fuji.
WHIP Look, I'm tired man.
HARLING MAYS I'm out.
HARLING MAYS You rest up.
WHIP You gotta come and get me, tomorrow.
WHIP pulls his keys from the bag that CHARLIE gave him.
WHIP (CONT'D) Here are my keys.
WHIP (CONT'D) Go to the condo and bring me some nice clothes I can wear, my phone charger and grab the veal outta my fridge.
WHIP (CONT'D) It's marked.
HARLING MAYS The veal?
WHIP Yeah, the veal that's in my freezer.
HARLING MAYS Done and done.
HARLING MAYS What time you need me here?
WHIP Tomorrow.
WHIP I'll call you.
HARLING MAYS Send the mayday and you're outta here in 7 minutes.
HARLING MAYS I got you a few stroke mags too.
HARLING MAYS I've been in hospitals.
HARLING MAYS I know what you need.
HARLING MAYS JUGS, HOT MILFS in heat.
HARLING MAYS ASSMASTERS.
HARLING MAYS You should just stroke it all day.
HARLING MAYS You're a hero -- know what I'm saying?
HARLING MAYS If I was in here I'd be jerkin' it all day long.
HARLING MAYS See, there's a smile.
HARLING puts his hand on WHIP's forehead in an attempt to reassure him.
A quiet moment before HARLING slips out.
WHIP wakes up in a cold sweat.
He is breathing heavy as he scans the room.
LIGHTENING FLASHES from outside the window.
Thunder RUMBLES.
WHIP looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine gum has been chewed through.
WHIP uses his hands to get to the edge of the bed.
He roots through the duffle bag that HARLING left and finds a pack of smokes and a Bic lighter still in its package.
Determined to smoke, WHIP eyes a WHEEL CHAIR that has been placed next to his bed.
Leaning against the wheelchair is a medical cane.
Wearing his Happi Coat (or robe), WHIP limps in to the empty hallway with the use of his cane.
He checks the quiet corridor as he begins his quest...
The door swings open, and no one appears to be on the other side.
Now WHIP fights to push the heavy door open again to slip through.
A hand grabs the door and holds it.
WHIP walks into the sanctity of the stairwell.
We find the owner of the helping hand was NICOLE who returns to a quiet spot along the wall of the stairwell as she demurely smokes a cigarette.
WHIP Thank you.
WHIP leans his cane against the wall and carefully pulls a pack of smokes from his pocket.
WHIP (CONT'D) I didn't think anyone would have the same devious thought about using the fire stairs to have a smoke...
NICOLE smiles and looks down, awkward around men when she is not loaded.
She drops her cigarette which we see was barely smoked as she maneuvers to leave.
WHIP (CONT'D) Don't go.
WHIP (CONT'D) I'll be quiet.
He offers her a cigarette, she takes it.
WHIP (CONT'D) We don't have to talk.
WHIP (CONT'D) Be nice to just smoke with someone.
And they do.
They sit in silence as the stairwell fills up with smoke.
After a long beat...
NICOLE Were you on the plane?
WHIP studies her, she's beautiful in an exhausted way...
WHIP Yeah, I was.
WHIP Were you?
Nicole shakes her head.
NICOLE Where were you sitting?
WHIP Up near the front.
Again it falls silent as we let them smoke and think in the sanctity of the fire stairs.
A VOICE breaks their silence.
VOICE Tobacco's but an Indian weed, Grows green in the morn, cut down at eve; It shows our decay, We are but clay;...I love the smell of Nicotina in the morning.
VOICE Smells like...victory.
We hear a metallic rattle and WHIP and NICOLE look to the stairs.
VOICE (CONT'D) Don't flee dear comrades!
VOICE (CONT'D) Really, wait for me, please.
A GAUNT YOUNG MAN makes his way to their landing.
He is dressed in a hospital gown and carrying an I.V. pole on which hangs a small bag of clear liquid.
The man's hair has completely left him.
His skin is gray.
Eyes hollowed from his battle with cancer.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Can I bum a smoke?
WHIP offers him a cigarette.
He takes it and fires it up with a lighter he keeps stowed in the pocket of his gown.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) I should quit, my cancer might get cancer.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Joke.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) You guys in the plane crash?
NICOLE He was.
WHIP looks at the ground as the GAUNT YOUNG MAN studies him.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN You're the fucking pilot.
Nicole gives Whip a look.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) I saw you on TV.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Holy shit, man.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Tough deal, but you walked away or it looks like you limped away.
WHIP Yeah, I'm lucky.
WHIP Goin' home tomorrow.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Home.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Home for me is the basement, they keep cancer treatment in the basement.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN I'm livin' here.
WHIP You're living here?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN No.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN I'm dying here.
WHIP What kind of cancer?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Fibro-mixzoid sarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Very rare, God chose me.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN laughs.
WHIP God chose you?
WHIP You believe in God?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Fuck yeah bitch.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN You're a stupid fucker if you don't believe in God.
The GOD topic has silenced the stairwell...
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) As soon as you realize that the random events in your life are God...you will live a much better life.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) You spend your life believing that you have all the control over what happens.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Bullshit.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) The plane you're flying goes down?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Out of your control.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) God gives you cancer.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) I have no control over that.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Did God give me cancer?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) You bet your ass God gave me cancer.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) You think if I begged for cancer God would have given it to me?
56. No...because I assure you I have begged for God to take it away - and guess what?
56. I have no control over that.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN smokes the cig to the nub and rubs the remains against the smooth concrete wall.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Can I get another smoke?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) What's wrong with you honey?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) You're beautiful, do you know that?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Do I scare you?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) People either have to pretend they don't see me or they're drawn to me.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) It's funny because people see me as being close to the other side -- they feel like I have power or wisdom.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) They think I have the answers.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Who knows?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Maybe I do.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Death gives you perspective.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) I lived my life so indecisive, in a haze.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) But now that I'm dying everything is so clear.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) It all makes sense somehow.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry but I can't get over how beautiful you are?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Look at your arm, you an addict?
NICOLE looks at him.
She nods.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) What's your name?
NICOLE Nicole.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN What do you do in the world Nicole?
She laughs, what a question.
NICOLE Not much.
NICOLE I was a photographer and then I was a masseuse and I wash hair at a salon sometimes.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Where is it?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN I'll come by, I'm easy, you can wash my head.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Do you think you're gonna die?
NICOLE laughs to keep from weeping.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) You're not.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) You're not gonna die.
The men watch as NICOLE quietly cries, it's powerful.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Don't you love her?
WHIP I don't know her.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Bullshit, I do.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Random act of God?
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Don't think so.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Survive a plane crash to meet a gorgeous girl in a stairwell.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Fuck you man.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN I'm sure they're looking for me.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN My family just showed up from Utah.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN You know it's bad when they start flying in.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Every morning is special now, I'm so grateful.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN It's a trip, wish I could bottle this feeling I have...about how beautiful every breath of life is..
GAUNT YOUNG MAN starts laughing.
WHIP joins him.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D) Can I get a smoke for the road?
WHIP Here's a pack.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Thank you, I'll pass them out in the cancer ward.
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Take care Nicole, you're gonna be okay.
The GAUNT YOUNG MAN leaves, clanging away with his I.V. pole.
NICOLE wipes away her tears, we see her hospital bracelet as well as her track marks.
NICOLE Chemo brain.
NICOLE Chemo makes you pretty foggy.
WHIP Yeah?
NICOLE They call it chemo brain, my mom used to slur her words and get all chatty.
WHIP Your mom had cancer.
NICOLE Breast cancer, she was only 54.
It's quiet.
WHIP But why'd that guy ask you if you were gonna die?
NICOLE I dunno.
NICOLE I flat-lined twice in the ambulance.
NICOLE Heroin addicts who use needles tend to die.
NICOLE Especially women for some reason.
WHIP Is that right?
NICOLE I have a pamphlet to prove it.
NICOLE A girl from AA just came to see me --
NICOLE That guy was a trip.
NICOLE He made it feel like, I dunno...we were the last people left on the planet..
NICOLE ...and together we should save the world.
NICOLE steps on her cigarette and puts the nub in her pocket.
She begins to leave.
WHIP stops her.
WHIP Well, where should we live?
WHIP If we're gonna save the world, where should we do that?
NICOLE laughs.
WHIP (CONT'D) What?
NICOLE You don't want me.
WHIP laughs.
NICOLE (CONT'D) What?
WHIP You don't want me either.
NICOLE's laugh tapers off as she senses his honesty.
WHIP (CONT'D) Where do you live?
NICOLE Why you wanna come visit?
NICOLE It's luxurious.
NICOLE I live in Bankhead, it's south Atlanta, near the bus station.
WHIP The luxurious bus station?
NICOLE Yeah.
WHIP I'll come visit you.
NICOLE You're sweet.
WHIP I will.
WHIP What's your address?
She measures him.
NICOLE I live at the Georgian Gardens on Taylor street.
WHIP Georgian Gardens?
NICOLE Yeah.
WHIP How long are you staying here?
NICOLE Trying to stay as long as I can but I don't have insurance to cover rehab.
NICOLE I'll prolly be out tomorrow.
WHIP Oh.
WHIP Okay.
WHIP And you're a masseuse?
NICOLE Yeah.
WHIP What kind of masseuse?
NICOLE I've been every kind of masseuse there is.
There is strong tension between them.
An orderly busts through the down the stairs.
This breaks their stare.
WHIP Good luck Nicole.
NICOLE You too.
WHIP leaves NICOLE where he found her.
WHIP is wheeled out of a service exit by an ORDERLY who also holds the duffle bag of WHIP's stuff around his neck.
Whip no longer wears the eye patch but has a butterfly bandage over his left eye brow.
HARLING jumps out of his 2001 Cadillac STS and immediately takes over, grabbing the duffel bag.
WHIP Thanks Mike.
The ORDERLY tries to hand WHIP a medical file.
HARLING snatches it.
HARLING MAYS Yeah, thanks Mike.
HARLING MAYS Here's 20 American.
ORDERLY MIKE Thanks.
ORDERLY MIKE Good luck, sir.
HARLING hugs WHIP who hangs on tight.
The ORDERLY spins the chair around and heads back inside.
HARLING uses his key fob to remotely pop the trunk and stow Whip's duffel.
HARLING MAYS This is how they get the Stones out of Madison Square Garden, man.
HARLING MAYS 4 smoked black limos fly outta the VIP driveway and the fans jump on the limos...mayhem.
HARLING MAYS Those limos?
HARLING MAYS Empty.
HARLING MAYS Meanwhile, Mick and the boys go out the service exit into delivery vans -- casual, rock star type shit.
HARLING MAYS HARLING helps him into the front seat and they pull away.
HARLING MAYS The Stones, "Gimme Shelter" starts to play...
53 As they drive off, we see media mayhem collected in front of 53 the hospital.
Trucks with towers, cameramen, stringers and newscasters add to catering trucks and coffee stands as the vultures wait for the carrion of sound bytes and footage of survivors.
INT. HARLING'S CADDY -- DAY Whip watches through the rear window -- the "Media Circus" disappears as the Caddy rounds a corner.
INT. HARLING'S CADDY -- DAY The back seat is piled with Whip's clothes, most of them still on hangers.
INT. HARLING'S CADDY -- DAY HARLING lights a cigarette and hands one to WHIP who takes it.
HARLING MAYS I couldn't find any suitcases so I just put your shit in grocery bags.
HARLING MAYS HARLING pulls a cold Becks from a cooler on the floor of the back seat and uses a bottle opener that's been screwed to the dash of his car next to the radio to open the beer.
HARLING MAYS He offers the beer to WHIP who waves it off.
HARLING MAYS HARLING gladly keeps it for himself...
HARLING MAYS "Gimme Shelter" continues to play...
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) So you're stayin' with me down on University, right?
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) It's nice.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) A lotta young people...good vibe.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Harling tosses Whip a freezer bag marked:"VEAL" -- Whip begins to open it.
WHIP No.
WHIP I'm gonna go to the farm.
HARLING MAYS The fucking farm?
WHIP My dad's place.
WHIP I can't stay at my condo.
HARLING MAYS I thought you sold that fucking place.
WHIP Not yet.
HARLING MAYS I'm not sure I wanna stay at the farm.
WHIP You're not.
WHIP Just take me to the airport to get my car.
WHIP Whip finishes opening the freezer bag -- it's full of cash.
WHIP HARLING starts to laugh...
58 Veal?
Really?
Don't you know the 58 first place every two-bit thief looks is in the freezer?
EXT. ATLANTA RURAL SUBURBAN ROAD - WHIP'S FARM - DAY WHIP's BUICK turns off the blacktop past a small weathered billboard: WHITAKER CROP DUSTING.
EXT. ATLANTA RURAL SUBURBAN ROAD - WHIP'S FARM - DAY Also a real estate "FOR SALE" sign is posted in front.
EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- DRIVEWAY -- DAY Whip pulls into a long, dirt driveway that approaches a one- story farm house.
EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- DRIVEWAY -- DAY He gets out of the car.
EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- DRIVEWAY -- DAY With his cane in one hand, he uses his free hand to toss the grocery bags close to the steps and heads inside.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM - DAY WHIP ambles in and we see the interior of the house bears the fading patina of a proud American Family.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM - DAY We see PHOTOS -- WHIP in his NAVAL FLYER UNIFORM.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM - DAY A GROUP MILITARY PHOTO -- a SQUADRON of NAVAL FLIERS on a carrier.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM - DAY WHIP's PARENTS next to the farm house.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM - DAY WHIP's FATHER stands next to WHIP who is holding his infant son.
WHIP empties his pockets onto the desk top.
His keys, wallet and his cell phone are placed next to an old rotary phone attached to an old answering machine.
WHIP plugs in his cell phone charge, dials in for his messages and puts it in "speaker mode" as we hear...
CELL PHONE You have 127 messages.
CELL PHONE Message one..."
CELL PHONE Captain Whitaker, this is Jim Court I'm with CNN.
CELL PHONE We'd like to schedule an interview..."
CELL PHONE Message two..."
CELL PHONE This is NBC affiliate KGAT in Athens we're looking to contact William J.
CELL PHONE Whitaker for..."
CELL PHONE Message three..."
CELL PHONE Captain Whitaker, this is Karen James, media relations with the pilots' union..."
WHIP again deletes the message and decides to just shut the phone down.
He continues to empty his pockets.
In his jacket pocket he finds a prescription bottle of pain pills.
WHIP holds it up, opens it and pours a few out in his hand.
WHIP pours the pain pills into the toilet.
He then opens the medicine cabinet and starts to empty all of the bottles into the toilet.
WHIP goes to the collection of liquor bottles next to the sink that act as a makeshift bar.
He picks up a bottle of vodka.
He unscrews the cap and sniffs the contents.
He slowly tips the bottle and pours it into the sink.
Whip opens the refrigerator and removes an assortment of beers.
He pops them open and pours them in the sink.
The faucet running to offset the pungent smell.
Whip opens a dresser drawer and finds a couple of zip-lock bags of "bud" hidden under the socks.
Whip dumps the weed into the toilet and FLUSHES it.
A cigarette dangles from WHIP's mouth as he ferrets around the room, showing the focus and determination of a serial killer cleaning his kill site.
He finds rolling papers, roaches, more liquor and weed -- he reaches into the Shell Bag that's hanging next to the shotgun rack and finds another "pint."
Whip opens the freezer to put in his frozen dinner and his "packet of veal" and finds another fifth of vodka.
He pours the vodka in the sink and tosses the bottle into the trash -- which is piled high with empties.
Through the kitchen window, Whip sees the farm's old weathered barn.
Whip furrows his brow.
WHIP slides open the heavy barn doors to reveal -- A VINTAGE CESSNA 172 -- covered in dust and bird shit from the years of stagnant storage.
WHIP lights a smoke as he marvels at the little piece of aviation history resting in his barn.
Whip walks past the plane and starts to examine the large, two-story, open-ceilinged barn that is junked full of farm equipment and old furniture.
He finds...
HIS GRANDFATHER, FATHER and WHIP pose next to the barn.
A CROP DUSTER acts as the background for a picture with a 15 year old WHIP and his father next to a small plane.
65. A series of pictures feature the PLANE in flight and SHOTS TAKEN FROM THE PLANE, aerials of the farm, etc.
65. WHIP holds the framed shot of he and his dad as he walks back to the plane, resting his arm on the wing.
65. WHIP pulls himself from the wall of photos and stares at his stuff.
65. We recognize what must be the stuff he took from his house after his divorce.
65. We see bikes, weights and fishing gear.
65. Whip rummages through a box of things packed from his home office.
65. Trophies, sports memorabilia, citations -- A PHOTO OF HE AND HIS WIFE from happier times.
65. THEIR WEDDING PHOTO.
65. Now Whip comes upon A FRAMED BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO of he and Charlie in their younger, Navy days -- wearing flight suits and standing on a carrier flight deck in front of an F-14 Tomcat.
65. Big smiles, full of hotshot pilot swagger.
65. WHIP puts the photo back and spots his golf bag.
65. He roots out a pint of cheap vodka from the inner pocket.
65. Next he finds a fifth of bourbon in his bicycle saddle bag.
65. He goes to the workbench and removes a couple of bottles from the paint shelf.
63 Whip dumps out the liquor onto the grass as he hobbles back 63 to the house.
65 WHIP uses just his cane now as he drags a garbage bag full of
65 empty liquor bottles to his garbage cans.
65 He tosses the bag of empties in a can.
65 His work done, WHIP lights a smoke and stares at the empty fields that run forever as does the landscape of his mind.
65 He quietly tries to grasp the horror he endured and the reality of his survival.
INT. KITCHEN TABLE -- LATER THAT NIGHT We hear the microwave beep and WHIP retrieves a frozen dinner.
WHIP sits at the coffee table eating his frozen dinner while watching news coverage of the crash.
WHIP is startled by the phone that never rings.
He snaps off the TV using the remote.
WHIP is in no hurry to answer the phone as the old time ring continues.
WHIP goes to the desk where the phone rests and he watches the old answering machine click on.
We hear...
WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides.
WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE Please leave a message and it will be returned.
WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE Thank you.
VOICE MAIL ...I think that was the beep.
VOICE MAIL Hey Cowboy, it's Charlie again.
WHIP reaches for the phone but decides to just listen to
CHARLIE I'm back in town and I stopped by the hospital tonight but they said you went home...so I guess you're feelin' pretty good, but um we went out to your condo and the manager said you had not returned.
CHARLIE sits at a beautiful wooden table in a modern glass- walled office above a baseball field.
The table is populated with casually-dressed businessmen and lawyers as this after- hours meeting was called on the fly.
CRASH SCENE PHOTOS and FILES fill the table top.
We also see a photo or two of the WHITAKER FARM.
VOICE MAIL So...you may be with relatives, which I understand.
VOICE MAIL I was really hoping to see you for breakfast.
VOICE MAIL I'm at the St.
VOICE MAIL Regis downtown.
67. There's an executive buffet on the 16th floor - 10 o'clock, okay?
67. If you get this, please come.
67. Some important stuff to cover.
67. Be good.
WHIP stands still as a beep sounds, ending the message.
The executive buffet is a staple at the ST.
REGIS.
A long center table with silver trays houses eggs and breakfast meats.
Fruit, bagels and a staff of servers cater to the business elite of Atlanta.
CHARLIE ANDERSON sits at a corner table with HUGH LANG, a young, well-dressed African American man.
CHARLIE and HUGH are chatting in jocular spirit when WHIP approaches, walking much more confidently with his cane.
CHARLIE Whip, hey buddy.
CHARLIE Glad you got my message.
CHARLIE Grab a seat.
WHIP studies HUGH as he pulls out his chair.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Whip this is Hugh Lang; he's an attorney from Chicago.
HUGH stands and shakes hands with WHIP.
HUGH Nice to meet you Captain Whitaker.
WHIP and HUGH remain standing, both feeling a little "alpha."
CHARLIE Siddown.
CHARLIE Coffee?
CHARLIE Miss, can we get some fresh coffee?
She smiles and nods.
She's off to get the coffee.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) We were just talking about your copilot's wife.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) She told a newspaper that "God landed that plane."
WHIP God landed the plane?
WHIP just stares at the two men who have large buffet plates surrounding them.
CHARLIE I too believe that God landed that plane.
CHARLIE The same way I believe that God should hit the buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent.
WHIP I'm good with coffee.
CHARLIE Len Caldwell was really trying to get here this morning.
CHARLIE Len is the president of the pilots' union and he wanted to be here with us and meet with you but they wanted him at the crash site.
CHARLIE So..
WHIP is quiet, anxious to hear the purpose of the meeting.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Whip, as you know, when a plane crashes, the NTSB sends a "go team" to the crash site immediately.
WHIP They find the flight data recorders?
CHARLIE Yes they found them, perfectly intact.
WHIP Great.
WHIP That solves everything.
WHIP The recorders will tell the story.
WHIP Why do we need a lawyer from Chicago?
CHARLIE Hugh's an attorney who specializes in criminal negligence-
WHIP Criminal negligence?
The WAITRESS returns with the coffee.
It's quiet as they wait for her to finish.
She does.
Death demands responsibility.
Six dead on that plane, someone has to pay.
The plane fell apart at 30 thousand feet.
The airline will try to prove equipment failure.
Which would make the manufacturer responsible.
The manufacturer of the plane will try to prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline.
Or pilot error.
I had to fly that plane inverted, that means upside down, Hugh.
Do you get the picture?
100 passengers hanging upside down, 500 feet off the ground.
Do you have any idea what that sounds like?
I do.
I heard the black box last night.
Are you a pilot?
No I'm not.
Then you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Hugh's on our team and it's the NTSB's ball game.
They run the investigation and they will ultimately rule on the cause.
They interview the entire flight crew and the passengers.
They hold
WHIP Charlie, what do I need to know?
WHIP I'm already tired of this guy.
HUGH The NTSB `go team' collects blood, skin and hair from the flight crew for a toxicology report.
WHIP studies the two men, trying to read their poker hands.
WHIP When did they do that?
HUGH In the hospital.
HUGH It's the first thing they do.
HUGH Do you remember having your blood drawn on the night of the crash?
WHIP looks at CHARLIE and then to HUGH...
WHIP Do they have the results of these blood tests?
HUGH Yeah, they do.
The WAITRESS checks in.
WAITRESS Anything else for you gentlemen?
WHIP Did I just see warm cinnamon rolls come out?
WAITRESS Yes sir.
WHIP Bring me one wouldya?
WHIP Actually bring me two, okay sweetie?
WAITRESS Comin' up.
An awkward silence as they wait for her to clear out.
HUGH An initial report shows alcohol in your bloodstream at a level of .24.
HUGH In the U.S.
71. -- one of the most lenient drunk driving countries in the world -- you go to jail for driving with a number over .08.
71. And by driving, I mean a car.
They all digest the information as the WAITRESS delivers the cinnamon rolls.
She leaves.
It's still quiet.
WHIP What does that mean?
WHIP I had a beer the night before I flew.
WHIP And what...That made the tail of the plane explode?
CHARLIE Separate issues Whip-
WHIP I need a lawyer.
CHARLIE Hugh is your lawyer.
WHIP I need a bigger lawyer.
WHIP A lawyer who understands that I flew a broken plane and without me at that stick there'd be 102 funerals, not
HUGH We're talking about prison not funerals.
HUGH Somebody has-
WHIP To write checks, well it's not me I promise you that.
WHIP And as long as they're writing checks, write me one because someone put me in a broken plane.
WHIP I'd love a check.
HUGH This tox report states that you were drunk and high on cocaine, felonies punishable by 24 years in jail.
HUGH And if your intoxication is proven to have caused the death of the 4 passengers you'll get 4 counts of manslaughter.
HUGH That could be life in prison.
72. Can I now do my job on your behalf and kill this tox report?
72. WHIP is listening.
72. CHARLIE tries to reign it in.
CHARLIE He'll get it done, Whip.
CHARLIE It's what his entire life is about.
CHARLIE Trust me, trust him.
CHARLIE Don't worry Whip, you're gonna walk away the hero you deserve to be.
WHIP I'm not worried, Charlie.
WHIP I promise you that.
WHIP No one could have landed that plane like I did, no one.
68 The WAITRESS returns with a coffee pot.
WHIP leaves.

INT. ST. REGIS HOTEL -- LOUNGE -- DAY Close on TV -- A SPLIT SCREEN -- CNN's PIERS MORGAN on one side of the screen asking questions of JIM TILMON, an aviation expert.
PIERS MORGAN Captain Tilmon, we wanna play a portion of the black box that all of the news outlets have grabbed hold of...
WHIP When I ask for power, push both of these forward.
WHIP Got it?
WHIP What's your son's name?
WIDER...WHIP STEPS UP TO THE BAR, GLANCING AROUND. The BARTENDER steps up to serve WHIP...
BARTENDER What'll you have?
WHIP Can I get an orange juice?
WHIP The BARTENDER leaves to grab the orange juice.
TELEVISION -- The transcription and AUDIO of the cockpit recording continues...
MARGARET Trevor.
WHIP Say "I love you Trevor."
MARGARET Why?
WHIP The black box.
MARGARET I love you Trevor.
MARGARET Be a good boy.
MARGARET Mommy loves you.
The BARTENDER returns with the orange juice.
BARTENDER That's it?
WHIP And a double shot of Stoli.
The BARTENDER nods and turns in acknowledgement of the order.
PIERS MORGAN Wow.
PIERS MORGAN That audio paints a strong picture.
PIERS MORGAN Captain Whitaker is surely a hero in my opinion.
JIM TILMON Absolutely.
JIM TILMON However, every incident is different.
JIM TILMON The actions of the pilots on SouthJet 227 will be heavily scrutinized.
JIM TILMON It's protocol for any investigation.
The BARTENDER returns with a frosted glass and pours two shots over the ice.
WHIP downs the vodka in a flash.
The OTHER BARTENDER has the remote and starts searching for more coverage of the crash.
He stops at a local report.
A REPORTER gives a lead in at the crash site.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #1 Kevin, it's still chaotic here at the site.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #1 Apparently a small ministry was conducting services near to where the plane came down.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #1 So the scene here is a mix of survivors and first responders, I was able to catch up with an actual passenger moments ago...
PASSENGER 1 We were in a nose dive and people were screaming and yelling and then the plane turned upside down and we had to hold on to our seat belts to keep from falling out of our chairs -- I saw one kid fall to the floor and this flight attendant picked him up and handed him to his dad...I didn't see her again.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #1 More details and more reports of the casualties are continuing to fly around.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #1 I can tell you that there appears to be many, many survivors.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #1 That's all I have for now.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #1 Kevin?
Another reporter has a passenger's account.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #2 Rebecca, surviving passengers are being put in ambulances, police cruisers and even first responder vehicles and they are being taken to local hospitals for treatment.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #2 Some of the injured appear serious and it's safe to assume at this point that there are at least a few fatalities.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #2 Let's roll the tape of the passenger I caught up with earlier.
A MAN with SHORT DARK HAIR explains his experience.
PASSENGER 2 We turned like a corkscrew and all I could think was, "this is really happening, I'm going to die" and then all of a sudden the plane was upside down but steady and the pilot must have known how to fly it that way.
PASSENGER 2 He flipped it back over and landed it hard.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #2 Obviously a harrowing ordeal for those on the troubled plane.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #2 This is Callie J Kenner for News 5.
A third Reporter gets a FEMALE NEIGHBOR's perspective.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #3 Folks in the houses that border this field came running from their houses...
NEIGHBOR I thought it was thunder at first.
NEIGHBOR But it shook the ground hard.
NEIGHBOR Thunder don't do like that.
NEIGHBOR I ran outside and I could hear people yelling and I could see a small fire at first.
NEIGHBOR I just took the dogs and headed down there.
NEIGHBOR Then I saw the plane crumpled on the ground.
NEIGHBOR I never seen nothing like that in my life.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #3 Just like that plane, this community is shattered.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #3 Folks here remain on edge as media trucks continue to line their small road and crowd the field where the plane still lies.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #3 Back to you, Tom.
A news light shines on a lone reporter who stands atop a small hill above the crash field.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #4 We're gonna take another look at the cell phone footage that captured the last moments of SouthJet's Flight 227.
WE SEE THE GRAINY CELL PHONE FOOTAGE OF THE PLANE After the PLANE levels off and smacks down in the field, we return to REPORTER #4 in the crash field.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #4 (CONT'D) Many hours have passed since the footage you just watched but the crash site remains active as investigators work through the night.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #4 (CONT'D) Using flood lights and miners' caps, teams continue to comb the crash field looking for the answers to the hard questions as to what brought down SouthJet's flight 227.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #4 (CONT'D) Those answers remain in darkness as do the broken pieces of the aircraft.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #4 (CONT'D) Hopefully sunlight will bring answers.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #4 (CONT'D) For now this is Kent Johnson reporting.

WHIP Whip rolls the Buick to a stop and scans the street.
P.O.V. THROUGH DRIVER SIDE WINDOW WHIP spots a SIGN: "Georgian Gardens Apartments" Suddenly, NICOLE flies into frame and tosses a box into the back of her Toyota.
P.O.V. THROUGH DRIVER SIDE WINDOW She hustles off leaving the hatchback open.
72 WHIP raises an eyebrow, and drives toward the building.
72
EXT. THREE STORY APARTMENT BUILDING -- ATLANTA -- DAY WHIP parks his car at a fire hydrant right in front of NICOLE's building and gets out with his cane.
EXT. THREE STORY APARTMENT BUILDING -- ATLANTA -- DAY He pops a fresh beer and looks at the building, looking for a proper entrance.

EXT. THREE STORY APARTMENT BUILDING -- ATLANTA -- DAY Whip thinks nothing of it and begins casually poking through the stuff in Nicole's car -- a random collection of junk including clothes and photographs -- mostly of rock bands performing.
EXT. THREE STORY APARTMENT BUILDING -- ATLANTA -- DAY Now, WHIP HEARS an argument escalating between Fran and
FRAN The guy in Unit 1 just told me you stayed here last night?!
NICOLE Franny relax, I'm just getting my shit outta here, okay?
FRAN What about the rent!
FRAN YOU OWE ME
MONEY! He heads off...
EXT. THREE STORY APARTMENT BUILDING -- STAIRCASE -- DAY WHIP does a decent job of making his way up the exterior staircase.
EXT. THREE STORY APARTMENT BUILDING -- STAIRCASE -- DAY That beer is making his leg feel a little better.
EXT. THREE STORY APARTMENT BUILDING -- STAIRCASE -- DAY WHIP moves more aggressively up the stairs as the ARGUMENT
FRAN Who do you think broke down this fucking door to let the paramedics in there?
FRAN Huh?!
FRAN -- You gotta pay for all this.
NICOLE I'm sorry.
NICOLE Just let me get my shit and get outta here.
NICOLE I will pay you when I can.
FRAN I know, just take a shower with me.
FRAN How hard is that?
FRAN C'mon.
NICOLE No.
NICOLE I'm not doin' that.
FRAN If I had a bag a dope you'd be on your knees in my shower right now, right?
FRAN Come on...
FRAN Gimme the camera, for collateral.
FRAN What's it worth?
NICOLE No fucking way!
NICOLE I will kill you if you touch this camera!
NICOLE I will pay for all of this!
NICOLE I will pay, okay!
WHIP crests the top of the staircase to see...
FRAN, the landlord, wielding a baseball bat as he berates NICOLE.
NICOLE has her full-bodied 35 MM camera hanging from a strap around her neck.
FRAN points the bat at her head.
Whip WHACKS Fran with his cane.
WHIP The fuck are you doin'!?
FRAN stumbles and falls as the bat goes flying to the ground and rolls away.
WHIP licks the foaming top of his excited beer.
FRAN (gives Whip a puzzled
LOOK) Hey, don't I know you?
Whip jabs him again with his cane.
WHIP Keep your fucking hands off her!
NICOLE who is crying, now laughs in relief.
She can't believe it.
"America's Hero" has just come to her rescue.
WHIP moves to comfort her..
WHIP (CONT'D) You okay?
WHIP (CONT'D) Is this all the stuff you want from here?
NICOLE Just this stuff.
She points to a camera tripod and a box of broken portfolios with photos dripping out.
WHIP Okay, start taking that stuff down.
FRAN has gotten up and stands a safe distance from WHIP...
FRAN She owes me 1100 bucks!
FRAN Plus damages!
WHIP You wanna spend a thousand bucks suing her and get jack shit?
WHIP Or do you want to make a cash deal with me?
FRAN Give me 700 in cash.
WHIP You're a creep...with your baseball bat bullshit...
Whip flings his beer at Fran's head, then pulls out his billfold.
WHIP (CONT'D) I'll give you 400 in cash.
Whip throws the money on the floor.
FRAN sorts the options...none...he tentatively bends down and picks up the cash.
Keeping a wary eye on Whip.
WHIP (CONT'D) Good boy.
WHIP (CONT'D) Now help her get that box in her car.
NICOLE Ah...my car doesn't run.
NICOLE It won't start.
NICOLE I'm taking this with me.
WHIP Your car doesn't run?
WHIP What were you gonna do?
NICOLE I don't...I...I was...
NICOLE I don't know what I was gonna do.
Fran smirks.
Whip drills Fran with his eyes...
WHIP Then put the fucking box in my car.
FRAN's smirk fades.
He relents and picks up the box as WHIP grabs the lighter shoulder bag and they head downstairs.
NICOLE stares out the window as the city disappears.
WHIP pulls a beer from the box and offers it to Nicole.
NICOLE smiles, thinks about it...she shakes her head, "no."
WHIP pops the top and takes a drink.
NICOLE What's your name?
WHIP looks to her, she to him.
They begin to laugh at the absurdity.
When it subsides...
WHIP Whip.
NICOLE nods.
A long moment quietly passes.
NICOLE Thank you, Captain Whip.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' "You Really Got a Hold on Me" plays as WHIP eases himself into a recliner using his cane.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT On the small table next to him rests his beer and an unopened bottle of bourbon with a glass of ice.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT WHIP cracks the seal on the bourbon bottle and pours a drink.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT He takes a sip and chases it with his beer.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT WHIP now starts to remove the brace that we clearly see under his basketball shorts.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT As he takes it off he tries to massage his aching leg.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT NICOLE enters the living room, fresh from a shower.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT WHIP studies her -- she's beautiful and innocent.
WHIP You okay?
NICOLE I was gonna lay down, get some rest.
WHIP Okay.
WHIP WHIP takes another sip before returning to massaging his leg.
NICOLE Is it really okay that I stay here?
WHIP Yea.
WHIP I want you to stay.
WHIP NICOLE walks over to WHIP and kneels down and gently takes over massaging his leg.
WHIP WHIP exhales.
WHIP (CONT'D) That feels better.
NICOLE It's throbbing because the blood is having a hard time getting back to your heart.
78 NICOLE continues to soothe his aching leg.
After a moment, 78 NICOLE stands and takes the drink out of WHIP's hand and sets it down.
She now bends down and kisses him softly.
She now stands and takes his hand, leading him in to the bedroom.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- DAY WHIP's been awake for hours as he sits at the foot of the bed.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- DAY Whip's wearing a long sleeve tee shirt and sweat pants and no shoes.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- DAY He looks at NICOLE -- sleeping angelically on her side of the bed.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- DAY Whip watches her sleep for a long moment, until...
80 He hears something.
He gets up and goes to the window.
It's a
80 car pulling up the driveway.
INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN DOOR -- DAY WHIP opens the door to find HUGH in his driveway.
INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN DOOR -- DAY WHIP casts a strange figure with his bare chest, boxers and brandishing a shotgun.
INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN DOOR -- DAY They stare at each other.
HUGH Do you wanna shoot me or can I come inside?
WHIP C'mon in.
WHIP I'll shoot you inside.
WHIP HUGH walks closer to the porch.
WHIP WHIP questions him.
WHIP (CONT'D) You just decided to drop by?
HUGH Your voice mail is full and you never answer your cell phone.
HUGH I called your cell 10 times.
WHIP I turned it off.
WHIP HUGH nods as the explanation lands.
HUGH I thought we'd take a ride.
HUGH WHIP measures HUGH's intention...
WHIP Okay, gimme a minute.
WHIP Wait here.
82 HUGH nods and recedes from the door as WHIP goes to get 82 dressed.
WHIP joins HUGH on a rectangular platform on top of a two- story scaffolding frame.
The platform provides a perfect view of flight 227's final resting area.
We see the awesome devastation that 50 tons of metal flying at 140 miles an hour can do to a hillside.
HUGH You can see the initial impact sheared the right wing clean off.
HUGH If only the left wing had come off at impact, I think everyone would have walked off that plane.
WHIP The left wing partially pulled away-
HUGH It snapped but stayed connected to the airframe.
HUGH So it whipped back towards the plane, hit the fuselage in front of the tail.
HUGH If you were sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on the left side, it was like being hit by a train.
WHIP I drank a lot the night before that flight.
WHIP I drank that morning too and I used coke to straighten up.
HUGH I know, it's in the toxicology report.
WHIP But that's not the reason this happened.
HUGH I know.
WHIP looks at HUGH expecting him to finish his thought.
HUGH holds his look for a beat before changing thoughts.
HUGH (CONT'D) The John the Baptist Pentecostal Mission.
We hear voices; a low murmur that gets louder, chanting.
WHIP looks to the top of the hill to see...
A MINISTER in a dark purple cloak calls from the new testament as the CONGREGATION responds in unison.
MINISTER "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away."
MINISTER -- Revelation 21:4
There are at least 50 people sitting in white folding chairs at the foot of the hill.
A small brook babbles behind them.
WHIP continues to take in the bizarre scene.
HUGH They helped pull survivors out of the wreckage.
HUGH Now they come out here every day and have a mass 30 minutes prior to the crash.
HUGH And then they sit in silent prayer for 10 minutes at 9:42...which is when you went down.
WHIP is overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crash field and the WORSHIPPERS.
WHIP looks back at the crash site to see...
Inside the crash site, a small group of INVESTIGATORS with NTSB jackets following the lead of a CONFIDENT WOMAN.
HUGH answers the question in WHIP's mind...
HUGH (CONT'D) Ellen Block, she's the head of the investigation for the NTSB.
HUGH (CONT'D) She's the one that's gonna ask the tough questions.
WHIP Why'd you bring me here?
HUGH I needed you to see this.
WHIP You trying to scare me?
HUGH I need to know that you can handle all this.
WHIP continues to stare at the awesome dent in the earth.
HUGH (CONT'D) Listen clearly.
HUGH (CONT'D) There was a mechanical issue with the plane, but what you and I know?
HUGH (CONT'D) Is that this was an act of God.
HUGH (CONT'D) I'm gonna fight to get the NTSB to place "act of God" on the probable causes list.
WHIP Who's God would do this?
It's quiet before HUGH makes his case.
HUGH So here's the deal.
HUGH Avington Carr, the owner of the airline, is on our side...and he's got big friends in Washington.
HUGH He wants to sit down with us.
HUGH 10 O'clock tomorrow morning.
WHIP's had enough.
He starts to walk away.
HUGH stops him.
HUGH (CONT'D) You can't drink.
HUGH (CONT'D) You're under the microscope.
HUGH (CONT'D) You can't be out buying liquor.
HUGH (CONT'D) No bars, no drugs.
WHIP I'll stop.
WHIP I can stop.
WHIP I told you I can stop.
WHIP I won't drink.
HUGH 10 O'clock tomorrow morning with Mr. Carr, the owner of the airline.
A huge office with a glass wall that looks out over the diamond.
We are high above the outfield; if GOD was a baseball fan, this would be his office.
We now meet AVINGTON CARR, a very righteous and self-satisfied, wealthy, southern gentlemen.
MR. CARR I never wanted that fuckin' airline.
MR. CARR Neither did my brother.
CARR scans the room, reading faces, holding court.
MR. CARR (CONT'D) It was my father that wanted it.
MR. CARR (CONT'D) I like baseball.
Ornate, wood furniture helps to announce the political feel of MR.
CARR's world.
Presidential photos and commendations pepper the walls.
It's quiet...
HUGH LANG I like baseball.
Everyone looks to HUGH as it gets oddly silent...
We get our first look at LEN CALDWELL, the president of the pilots' union.
LEN tries to wrest some control and exude some confidence.
LEN CALDWELL Everyone in Georgia likes baseball.
MR. CARR Yeah...so what's the deal Lenny?
MR. CARR Is your union gonna survive this one?
MR. CARR More importantly?
MR. CARR How big a check you think I'm gonna have to write?
LEN CALDWELL There were 6 fatalities on the
HUGH LANG The 2 crew members don't get settlements like the passengers.
HUGH LANG That's a workman's comp claim, part of the union contract -- they do a dangerous job and they know it.
MR. CARR You're the lawyer for the pilots' union?
LEN CALDWELL No, this is Hugh Lang, the attorney we brought in to handle the criminal side of Captain Whitaker's situation.
MR. CARR Yes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's situation?
MR. CARR NTSB is up my ass with a flashlight.
MR. CARR We had to give them access to everything.
87. And everyone is curious about Captain Whitaker.
Through a glass wall we see...
CHARLIE I flew with him.
CHARLIE He's a great pilot.
MR. CARR Is he a drunk?
CHARLIE He's a heavy drinker.
CHARLIE Should I bring him in?
Everyone steals glances at WHIP as CARR continues to dominate.
MR. CARR In a minute.
MR. CARR Alright, so let's get down to it, Lenny.
MR. CARR What does the union plan to do about this blood test that says Whitaker was high on booze and coke?
MR. CARR This guy's a real peach.
HUGH I'm gonna kill the toxicology report.
HUGH It was done incompetently.
HUGH The last time the toxicology equipment they used was calibrated was in June of 2009, which is 18 months past code.
HUGH Their log that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials and when, is very incomplete.
HUGH And they aren't sure who stored them.
HUGH They used a preservative in the vials that has in some cases caused blood to ferment and register higher in an alcohol test.
HUGH That's what I've done so far.
HUGH I can handle this.
MR. CARR I like this guy Lenny.
MR. CARR He makes me wanna go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet.
LEN CALDWELL Mr. Carr, we're gonna fight to push all the fault on Jackson Ridgefield, the manufacturer.
MR. CARR Oh and you think they're gonna just open their check book and buy us all lunch?
MR. CARR Good fucking luck.
MR. CARR What's my exposure Jim?
CARR'S BUSINESS GUY The awards to the families could kill the airline.
MR. CARR Fuck the airline.
MR. CARR The insurance companies can have the goddamm airline.
MR. CARR I just don't want them to come sniffing in my other pockets.
LEN CALDWELL Speaking for the pilots' union?
LEN CALDWELL We don't want your airline to go away.
LEN CALDWELL We enjoy your contract with us and we will protect Captain Whitaker and in turn protect your airline.
MR. CARR That's sweet Mr. Caldwell, but if the NTSB leaks that toxicology report showing my pilot was flying that plane drunk?
MR. CARR We're all fucked.
CHARLIE So far we've been lucky.
MR. CARR Lucky?!
MR. CARR Are you that goddammed dumb?!
MR. CARR You think they're waiting for a light news day to splash the headline, "Drunk, coke-addled pilot crashes a plane?!"
EVERYONE goes quiet as CARR's anger commands silence.
MR. CARR (CONT'D) My brother's in DC on his knees at the foot of the throne begging for forgiveness.
MR. CARR (CONT'D) And so far it's working.
89. They've got their boot on the neck of this girl Ellen Block runnin' the show for the NTSB and she is pissed.
89. Can you handle that?
HUGH can't stifle a laugh.
They look to him.
HUGH LANG Trust me, I'm gonna kill the toxicology report.
HUGH LANG That's my job.
CARR looks to his lawyer who nods...
CARR'S ATTORNEY I wish you luck, but we're still sorting out the best way to go forward legally.
CARR'S ATTORNEY We might split from you and go it alone.
CARR stands to signal the end of the meeting.
HUGH stands to stop him.
HUGH LANG To go it alone?
HUGH LANG Without us?
HUGH LANG That would be what the French call "a big fucking mistake."
MR. CARR Does Whitaker know he's going to jail?
HUGH LANG I haven't had a client go to jail yet.
MR. CARR He's going to jail.
MR. CARR He belongs in jail.
MR. CARR You bet your ass he's going to jail, the question is...is he gonna die in jail?
HUGH LANG You're wrong, Mr. Carr.
CARR'S ATTORNEY Last time I checked, 6 counts of manslaughter is life in prison.
MR. CARR Life in prison, what we in Georgia call "all day long."
It goes quiet as everyone reflects on that reality.
INT. CARR'S OFFICE -- WAITING ROOM -- DAY WHIP stands up as the meeting spills into the waiting room.
INT. CARR'S OFFICE -- WAITING ROOM -- DAY Handshakes are exchanged as CARR walks to WHIP and offers his hand to shake.
MR. CARR They tell me you're some kind of pilot.
86 CARR nods, sizing WHIP up.
WHIP returns the nod as HUGH 86 quickly puts a hand on WHIP's back and leads him away like a heavyweight being returned to his corner after pre-fight instructions.
THE TELEVISION IN WHIP'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT We are now in WHIP's living room watching HOME MOVIES...
WHIP'S VOICE Get up!
WHIP'S VOICE What?
WHIP'S VOICE You can't get up?!
WHIP'S VOICE C'mon, Knuckles Whitaker drags himself up and goes long...go.
WHIP'S VOICE We watch an 8 year-old WILL WHITAKER run long as the ball flies to him.
WHIP'S VOICE He catches it and on-screen WHIP hollers.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) Touchdown Whitaker!
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) Atta boy!
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) C'mon back.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) What?
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) Come back and do it again.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) Tired?
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) Junior, you don't know tired.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) I'm not going out.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) You go out.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) Keep running.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) We pull away from the screen to find WHIP who sits on the couch.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) A large bottle of vodka appears empty amidst many dead beers and an ashtray that overflows.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) WHIP moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a cigarette from the pack and light it.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) He freezes at one point and places his hands straight out in front of himself, a strange, involuntary, drunken reset.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) His stare is a 1000 miles offshore; he is anywhere but on this planet.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) Oblivion.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) The light from the HEADLIGHTS of a car in the driveway wash across the walls of the living room.
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) We hear a car door open and women exchange good byes.
SHEILA Keep coming back, Nicole.
SHEILA One day at a time.
NICOLE I know, one day at a time.
87A We hear them laugh as WHIP still stares in to space.
87A
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- DOOR -- NIGHT The door pushes open and NICOLE comes in with the Big Book of AA in her hand.
NICOLE Hey.
NICOLE Sorry I'm a little late, but we went for coffee after the meeting...
NICOLE Whip?
NICOLE NICOLE goes close to see WHIP look at her with a non-focused stare.
NICOLE She sees the table and reads the situation.
NICOLE NICOLE watches as WHIP stands up.
NICOLE In his oblivion he tries to focus.
WHIP Don't, don't, don't!
WHIP I'll get him.
WHIP Knuckles, junior.
WHIP See him.
WHIP Yeah.
WHIP I'm not calling again.
WHIP Fuck him.
WHIP He didn't call.
WHIP Not back.
WHIP Not calling back.
WHIP NICOLE backs away as she watches the blacked-out ballet play itself out in slow, tragic fashion.
WHIP WHIP motions to his lips as if he is smoking.
WHIP He freezes and then steps forward and trips in to the coffee table.
WHIP Whip falls to the ground.
WHIP NICOLE checks WHIP's face to see his eyes partially opened but passed out.
WHIP NICOLE goes to the bedroom and returns with a blanket that she covers WHIP with.
WHIP She also places a pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to the side so he doesn't choke.
WHIP NICOLE looks around the room.
WHIP She begins to collect the bottles and straighten up.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BEDROOM -- MORNING CLOSE ON WHIP's FACE as he struggles with a thick hangover.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BEDROOM -- MORNING He rubs his face and smacks his lips, he's dry as a bone.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BEDROOM -- MORNING WHIP shakes his head as he tries to focus his look through the bedroom window.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BEDROOM -- MORNING He looks out to see NICOLE sitting on a chair enjoying the landscape.
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BEDROOM -- MORNING WHIP rubs his head before walking to the kitchen.
WHIP pulls open the door to the fridge and pulls out a gallon of water in a plastic jug.
WHIP stands and takes a long pull of the cold water.
NICOLE sits with her camera staring at a candle on the table in front of her.
An AA Book rests on the table.
She snaps a picture of the flame and then focuses out to the grassy landing strip and the rolling hills.
WHIP enters carrying the large plastic bottle of water from the kitchen.
WHIP Morning.
WHIP coughs and rubs his eyes.
NICOLE Are you okay?
NICOLE You were in bad shape when I got home.
WHIP Tired.
WHIP Guess I drank a bit.
NICOLE A bit?
WHIP You wanna count the fuckin' beers?
WHIP They're still in the garbage.
WHIP Vodka too, is that okay with you?
NICOLE It's more than okay, Whip.
WHIP Good.
It's quiet as they let the awkward exchange pass.
NICOLE I've been watching the sky change as the sun rises.
NICOLE Beautiful.
NICOLE Perfect light, I went out and took some great shots.
WHIP reaches for the camera.
She hands it to him.
WHIP Lemme see that camera.
NICOLE My mom got it for me.
NICOLE Towards the end, when she knew she wasn't gonna recover.
NICOLE She maxed out her credit card to buy me that camera and a lighting kit.
NICOLE takes a moment to tamp down some emotions.
NICOLE (CONT'D) It's just so beautiful here.
NICOLE (CONT'D) Did you grow up here?
WHIP still holds the camera as he sits down.
WHIP It was my grandfather's farm, my dad grew up here.
WHIP He was a pilot in World War II, flew with the 332nd.
WHIP See the landing strip out there?
WHIP He built that.
WHIP He ran a crop duster outta here until the EPA put an end to that.
WHIP He traded the crop duster for a used Cessna.
WHIP He flew that damn thing all over.
WHIP It's still in the barn.
WHIP I was gonna sell this place after my dad died.
WHIP Then I got divorced...
NICOLE And your mom?
WHIP Dead...she's dead.
WHIP Your dad still alive?
NICOLE I'm pretty sure my father lives in Colorado.
WHIP You got no relationship with him.
NICOLE He drank.
NICOLE It was my mom that raised me.
NICOLE She was incredible.
NICOLE lights a cigarette as the memories are tough.
NICOLE (CONT'D) She held it together for so long, I couldn't tell how sick she was.
NICOLE (CONT'D) Even through chemo she looked beautiful.
NICOLE (CONT'D) NICOLE leans over and blows out the candle.
NICOLE (CONT'D) They gave her very heavy meds for pain.
NICOLE (CONT'D) Dilauded, morphine, oxycontin.
NICOLE (CONT'D) I started taking them with her.
NICOLE (CONT'D) We would get all medicated and sit in our back yard and talk and talk and watch the sun go down.
NICOLE (CONT'D) We'd be so stoned that we couldn't get up to go inside when it got dark.
NICOLE (CONT'D) I know it sounds crazy to get hooked on dope with your mom, but she was dying and we spent her last seven months together like teenagers, trading stories about boys and whatever.
NICOLE (CONT'D) She loved me.
NICOLE (CONT'D) WHIP lifts the camera and points it at NICOLE.
NICOLE (CONT'D) She contorts her face into a sly smile.
NICOLE (CONT'D) WHIP snaps it...she laughs.
The blue sky is the perfect backdrop as we reveal...
INT. ST. THOMAS AQUINAS CATHOLIC CHURCH -- DAY WHIP in a dark suit walks amidst mourners who file out of the church.
INT. ST. THOMAS AQUINAS CATHOLIC CHURCH -- DAY The center of attention is a large, distraught woman in her 60's being consoled by what appears to be her son and his wife.
INT. ST. THOMAS AQUINAS CATHOLIC CHURCH -- DAY The WOMAN wears a pin that holds a photo of TRINA.
INT. ST. THOMAS AQUINAS CATHOLIC CHURCH -- DAY WHIP stands at the bottom of the steps, watching folks, looking for someone.
INT. ST. THOMAS AQUINAS CATHOLIC CHURCH -- DAY Suddenly, a 9 year-old BOY stands in front of him.
INT. ST. THOMAS AQUINAS CATHOLIC CHURCH -- DAY The BOY locks eyes with him.
BOY I'm Trevor.
BOY You saved my mom.
BOY WHIP looks up to see MARGARET THOMASON walking towards him.
BOY She has her left arm in a sling underneath her jacket.
BOY We can see a bandage along her hairline.
BOY WHIP smiles, obviously uncomfortable.
BOY MARGARET hugs him.
MARGARET It's great to see you, Whip.
WHIP You too Margaret.
WHIP Broken collar bone?
MARGARET Yeah, and some stitches but I'm fine.
MARGARET I really am.
MARGARET It was a nice service.
MARGARET I mean, look at all these people that wanted to say goodbye.
MARGARET She looked beautiful in there.
MARGARET Didn't you think so, Whip?
MARGARET Like she was gonna wake up and smile.
WHIP I didn't go in.
WHIP I couldn't.
MARGARET is sensing WHIP's struggle.
MARGARET Trevor, find Dad.
MARGARET He's by Mr.
MARGARET Benton, there.
MARGARET Are you okay?
MARGARET You should come to the counseling group.
MARGARET The union has great people for us to talk to.
WHIP No.
WHIP I can't, really.
WHIP I will, but just not now.
It's quiet.
MARGARET smiles and leans in and kisses WHIP on the cheek.
MARGARET Take care Whip, okay?
She starts to leave...WHIP stops her with...
WHIP Yeah...y'know...I'm in the middle of this investigation.
WHIP The NTSB is investigating the crash-
MARGARET I know.
MARGARET I'm going in to see them next week.
WHIP I'm nervous because I was out the night before the crash at dinner-
MARGARET With Trina...
WHIP Yeah and I had two glasses of wine.
WHIP And they might ask you about my condition that morning and if you thought I had anything to drink.
MARGARET appears speechless...
WHIP (CONT'D) What?
MARGARET I've known you 11 years and you're gonna stand here and tell me you and Trina went to dinner and you drank two glasses of wine?
MARGARET Sounds like a nice restaurant Whip, which one was it?
WHIP You have to tell them it was an ordinary day.
WHIP I mean it was an ordinary day.
WHIP You know I was in shape to fly.
WHIP You have a problem with saying that?
MARGARET It's a lie.
MARGARET Whip, it's a lie.
MARGARET Trina told me you two hadn't been to sleep.
WHIP My lack of sleep made the plane fall apart, huh Margaret?
WHIP I'm just trying to get it straight.
WHIP You think that another pilot would have been able to land that plane and save more lives?
MARGARET I didn't say that Whip.
MARGARET I can't imagine another pilot doing-
WHIP Well can you imagine Trevor at this same church looking at you in that box in there?
WHIP Or my son having to come and see me in prison?
MARGARET fights tears as WHIP has struck a blow.
MARGARET Please Whip, enough.
MARGARET Don't you think we've all had enough.
MARGARET What do you want me to say?
WHIP It was an ordinary day.
WHIP The storm right after we took off was very severe, but as far as the flight crew was concerned it was a perfectly ordinary day.
The tears flow now as MARGARET can't hold them in.
WHIP realizes he's gone too far.
Not knowing what to do, WHIP walks away.
WHIP watches an airliner fly over head as he stands by his car smoking a cigarette.
He wears his suit from the funeral.
NICOLE approaches.
She's in a great mood.
NICOLE Are you okay?
NICOLE How was it?
WHIP It was okay, okay.
WHIP How're you doin'?
A beat.
NICOLE Well, I got through my first day.
NICOLE They haven't fired me.
WHIP That's good.
WHIP Cause for a celebration.
NICOLE They needed someone to work the night shift.
NICOLE They asked me and it's time and a half so...
She sorts through her shoulder bag...
NICOLE (CONT'D) I gotta vest and here's my name tag.
NICOLE (CONT'D) Oh oh oh....I got you something..
NICOLE (CONT'D) It's a P-51 mustang on there...
NICOLE (CONT'D) (flies her arms like
WINGS) You're dad flew a P-51, right?
WHIP He did.
WHIP So should we get some dinner?
NICOLE I promised Sheila I would be at the meeting tonight.
NICOLE She's the one that's been helping me, my sponsor.
NICOLE Can we do it tomorrow night?
NICOLE And Please, Whip don't make me choose between dinner with you and the meeting.
WHIP nods, playing with the lighter.
WHIP No, it's okay.
WHIP You should go.
NICOLE Why don't you come with me?
NICOLE We'll eat after.
NICOLE It's an open meeting.
WHIP Open meeting?
NICOLE That means anybody can come.
NICOLE Anybody.
WHIP Even me?
She is bubbling with happy spirit; she's hot.
She's hard to deny as WHIP can't help but smile at her.
A MAN stands at a podium wearing a coat and tie.
He is lost in the energized retell of a story.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 The cop is shining his flashlight on me.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 I'm standing there behind the dumpster, wearing nothing but my girlfriend's panties, vomit on my chest and I say to the cop...about two beers.
The room erupts with laughter.
NICOLE is really taken by the candor of the speaker as she joins the room in laughter.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) That's why they call me "Two-Beer" Barry.
BARRY makes eye contact with a STERN LOOKING OLD TIMER.
BARRY holds up a loose leaf binder and addresses the man...
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) Don't worry Ed, I got the format right here.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Ed's giving me the stink eye.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) Let me get back to the format...
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) I'm Barry.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) I'm an alcoholic.
THE ASSEMBLY Hi Barry.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 Are there any other alcoholics present?
WHIP glances around to find himself in a sea of raised-handed alcoholics.
A few look at WHIP with no judgement.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) I like meetings that have us all identify.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) Because it makes me tell the truth about who I am.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) It reminds that I never ever told the truth.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) I lied about everything.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) My whole life had been a lie.
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) And I was told that I would never get sober if I kept lying.
WHIP is very reserved, poker-faced.
A.A. SPEAKER #1 I mean, lying's what I'm good at.
A.A. SPEAKER #1 If I know anything in this life it's how to lie, especially about my drinking.
100. We pan the faces and everyone seems immediately connected.
100. Except WHIP who leans over to NICOLE.
WHIP I gotta go.
WHIP Okay?
WHIP Can uh...
NICOLE Yeah, Sheila.
NICOLE She can take me back to work.
SHEILA I'm Sheila.
SHEILA WHIP shakes her hand before quickly escaping as if from a fire.
SHEILA We stay close on WHIP's face as he walks out.
SHEILA BARRY continues his pitch.
A.A. SPEAKER #1 Like I said, I would lie about everything.
A.A. SPEAKER #1 It didn't matter what it was.
A.A. SPEAKER #1 My whole life had been a lie.
A.A. SPEAKER #1 A series of lies strung together by me.
A.A. SPEAKER #1 And when I drank?
A.A. SPEAKER #1 It was worse.
A.A. SPEAKER #1 What I came to understand was that, my lies were killing me.
A.A. SPEAKER #1 And that remains the great fact for me...My lies will kill me.
93 WHIP is gone.
93
INT. ROUND TABLE RESTAURANT -- BAR -- MINUTES LATER WHIP enters the bar and we hear off camera a voice coming from the TV above the bar.
PIERS MORGAN The NTSB is focusing their investigation on the flight crew, specifically Captain Whitaker.
KEN EVANS Sir, I am not at liberty to discuss Captain Whitaker or any of the flight crew.
KEN EVANS WHIP looks up to the TV.
KEN EVANS And in truth, I don't have much to say about him.
PIERS MORGAN So, safe to say that he remains a mystery.
KEN EVANS Sir, those are your words not mine.
WHIP exits as fast as he arrived.
He's gone.
PIERS MORGAN continues from the TV...
PIERS MORGAN I've been speaking to some people who are very close to the NTSB investigation and they are very confident that they will be able to determine exactly what brought this plane down.
KEN EVANS I'm sure they will sir.
PIERS MORGAN Thank you, Ken and Vicki Evans.
KEN EVANS Thank you, and God bless.
WHIP steps off an elevator and walks down the quiet hospital hallway toward a room where a few TECHNICIANS are packing up the last bits of TV equipment.
WHIP stands in the doorway and addresses EVANS...
WHIP How're you feeling, Ken?
EVANS stares at WHIP with a blank look.
EVANS Happy to be alive.
VICKI EVANS Blessed to be alive.
WHIP I'm Captain Whitaker, I was flying-
VICKI EVANS I know who you are.
WHIP senses an unwelcome undercurrent.
He locks eyes with EVANS trying to read him.
Silence before EVANS speaks to the
EVANS Ma'am can you give us some privacy?
EVANS Thank you.
EVANS Come on in sir.
EVANS Shut the door.
The ATTENDING NURSE files out placing a chair next to the bed as she leaves.
WHIP enters.
It's again quiet.
WHIP Listen, how long have you been...
EVANS Outta the coma?
EVANS Two days.
WHIP I didn't mean to disrupt your whole day.
WHIP I know they been swamping you with interviews.
WHIP You were great on
EVANS smiles at WHIP.
EVANS Both my legs were crushed and my pelvis snapped.
EVANS I'll probably never walk again, least not without a walker or braces.
EVANS I'll certainly never fly again.
WHIP I'm sorry Ken.
EVANS That plane was doomed the second you sat in the chair.
EVANS You reeked like gin or somethin'.
EVANS I called Vicki from the plane before we took off.
EVANS That's when the rain kicked up.
VICKI nods, holding her cross with the chain across her lips.
WHIP I don't know how much you remember, but the plane started to fall apart.
EVANS I remember everything until we crashed.
EVANS I know what went on.
WHIP What are we talking about?
EVANS I don't know Captain Whitaker, what are we talking about?
WHIP I just wanted to get a sense from you what you thought caused the crash.
EVANS Was it the fact that you got on the plane drunk from the night before?
WHIP goes white and drops his head.
EVANS (CONT'D) The NTSB is coming back tomorrow to finish taking a deposition from me about the events on the flight.
WHIP You think you'd be alive without me on that plane?
EVANS No, we'd all be dead.
EVANS But are you gonna argue that your physical state was tip top?
WHIP I'm not gonna argue anything with you.
WHIP gets up.
EVANS Sit, please sit.
EVANS I never shared my opinion about your physical state the morning of the flight.
EVANS I've never said word.
WHIP sits and studies EVANS.
EVANS (CONT'D) The flight was pre-ordained.
EVANS (CONT'D) I've prayed on it Captain.
EVANS (CONT'D) Vicki and I have prayed on it.
EVANS (CONT'D) There's only one judge --
VICKI EVANS Praise Jesus.
EVANS And he has a higher plan for you sir.
EVANS This event although tragic in its loss of life is also a celebration of life.
EVANS begins to mist up with sincere inspiration.
EVANS (CONT'D) Nothing happens in the Kingdom of the Lord by mistake.
VICKI EVANS Praise Jesus.
EVANS Captain, will you pray with me?
WHIP stares into EVANS' eyes and sees a believer's conviction.
EVANS reaches out his hand to WHIP.
WHIP slowly moves out of his chair and kneels at the side of EVANS' bed.
WHIP takes EVANS' hand and bows his head as he reaches for VICKI's at the same time.
It's quiet before...
EVANS (CONT'D) Jesus our Lord and savior we thank you for blessing Captain Whitaker with courage and wisdom.
EVANS (CONT'D) For guiding his hand on that fateful morning.
EVANS (CONT'D) In his divine light we were saved.
EVANS (CONT'D) Praise Jesus.
VICKI EVANS Praise Jesus.
VICKI EVANS It is quiet for an extended beat.
VICKI EVANS Finally...
WHIP Praise Jesus.
97 WHIP looks at EVANS and his WIFE whose heads are bowed with 97 reverence.
EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT A small pickup truck rambles to a stop in the driveway.
EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT We hear music and laughter as NICOLE gets out.
NICOLE Thanks for the ride guys.
NICOLE I'll see you tomorrow.
COWORKER Keep it up Nicole, you could be employee of the year.
COWORKER They all laugh; Nicole waves as they drive off.
COWORKER She walks towards the house which is dark.
COWORKER She hears music and looks towards the barn to see bright light escaping through the sagging doors and split wood walls.
EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT NICOLE slowly approaches the almost glowing barn door.
EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT Her curiosity compels her to pull it open.
INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT The door swings open to find the plane pointed towards the driveway with an aged patina but revitalized shine.
INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT Lenny Kravitz, "Fly Away" blares from the stereo...
INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT WHIP emerges from the cockpit.
INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT He's still in his suit but with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up.
INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT He's energized like an excited kid.
INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT He runs up and kisses her.
INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- NIGHT NICOLE notes the cloud of smoke hanging in the air and the burning cigarette in the ashtray, empty beers.
WHIP Looks great right?
NICOLE It's kind of...beautiful.
WHIP wipes at his nose.
WHIP It's a Cessna 172, it was my dad's.
WHIP He kept it perfect.
NICOLE takes in this cool trinket of aviation history.
NICOLE Does it work...
WHIP Yeah, he flew this plane a few months before he died.
WHIP I learned to fly in this plane.
WHIP You can land it anywhere.
WHIP laughs, remembering...
WHIP (CONT'D) My friend Harling and I flew it to Jamaica.
NICOLE Jamaica?
NICOLE In this?
WHIP We set off for an overnight fishing trip two hours south of here.
WHIP We ended up in Bethel, Jamaica.
NICOLE You're insane.
WHIP It was like a picture on a post card.
WHIP The white sand and sky blue water.
WHIP Most beautiful place I've ever been.
NICOLE Was the water warm?
WHIP Yeah, really warm.
NICOLE That's my kind of place.
WHIP Let's go.
NICOLE Sure, why not.
NICOLE laughs thinking they're playing a game.
WHIP Let's go tomorrow.
NICOLE You're serious?
WHIP We'll leave in the morning...we'll just go.
WHIP Start over.
NICOLE realizes he's serious as he opens another beer.
NICOLE Whip, we can't.
WHIP It's a beautiful beach, it's paradise.
NICOLE I'm worried about you.
WHIP I'm fine thanks.
NICOLE No you're not, you're really not.
NICOLE You need help, Whip.
NICOLE I think you need rehab.
WHIP You go to a couple of AA meetings and all of a sudden you think you're Jesus Christ?
WHIP Worry about yourself.
NICOLE We're the same Whip, you and me, we're the same-
WHIP I didn't suck dick to get high.
WHIP And don't give me a whole...
NICOLE Never Whip, I never in my life-
WHIP Your mom died and dad drank and bullshit, bullshit, bullshit --
NICOLE Stop.
NICOLE Please stop.
WHIP Is that why you shot dope?
NICOLE That's not fair-
WHIP Well there's a lot of people out there who lost their mom who've never had a drink in their life.
NICOLE You're sick, Whip.
NICOLE walks away, leaving WHIP with his plane and his dream of freedom.
WHIP calls after her.
WHIP I choose to drink.
NICOLE Do you?
NICOLE You choose it?
NICOLE I don't see a lot of choice goin' on.
WHIP I choose to drink!
WHIP And I blame it on me.
WHIP I'm happy to.
WHIP I've got an ex-wife and a son I don't see.
WHIP Why?
WHIP Because I choose to drink!
We follow WHIP as he enters the house and approaches the doorway of the bedroom.
WHIP sees NICOLE sitting on the bed.
She quickly tucks her cell phone away as WHIP holds up his hand to signal a truce.
WHIP Alright look, I was loaded when I crashed that plane.
WHIP With this investigation going on, I don't know what's gonna happen.
WHIP Come to Jamaica with me.
NICOLE Whip.
NICOLE I'm afraid I'll use again.
WHIP Come with me.
WHIP I need help, I do.
NICOLE I'd love for you to get help, Whip.
WHIP When we get to Jamaica we can go to the local hospital.
WHIP I'll do it for you.
WHIP Anything you want.
NICOLE looks at the sincere love in his eyes.
NICOLE I don't wanna use again.
NICOLE I can't.
NICOLE I won't make it back.
WHIP I'll be sober.
WHIP I won't force you to stay.
WHIP I promise if you don't like it or if I don't clean up?
WHIP You can leave.
This is the most sincere plea she's ever heard.
WHIP (CONT'D) It's so beautiful there.
WHIP (CONT'D) We'll leave before noon.
WHIP (CONT'D) I'm a great pilot.
WHIP (CONT'D) You'll get to see so much.
WHIP wraps his arms around her.
We stay on NICOLE's face as he holds her tighter and tighter.
NICOLE is dressed and sitting at the kitchen table.
Past NICOLE we can see WHIP lying in bed.
She has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at her feet.
She finishes a handwritten note and places it down.
NICOLE picks up the note and begins to reread it.
She hears a car in the driveway -- she picks up her stuff and takes one last look at the sleeping WHIP.
She leaves, careful not to make a sound.
NICOLE quietly exits the house, carrying a crate of her stuff.
She has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as she makes her way to SHEILA's car that we see parked at the top of the driveway, far from the house.
WHIP stirs, wakes up and looks around.
WHIP walks around looking for NICOLE.
He finds the note and reads it.
The reality of her disappearance sets in and he moves to the window and stares out at the barn.
WHIP returns his look inside the house and he sees the big book of AA on the table near where the letter was left.
WHIP picks it up and throws it across the room.
He then grabs the back of a chair and tosses it against the wall.
After wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall.
The bottle explodes and WHIP stops as he realizes he came within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his son.
We hear the antiquated ring of the OLD HOUSE PHONE.
WHIP relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him.
Whip is now drawing heavy breaths as the ringing phone is answered by the old machine...
WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides.
WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE Please leave a message and it will be returned.
WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE Thank you.
The beep concludes...
CHARLIE Hey Whip, if you're there pickup...I got some good news...
WHIP snatches the phone of the hook.
WHIP Yeah, I'm here.
WHIP What's goin' on?
104 WHIP listens as CHARLIE talks...
104
EXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY WHIP sits in his car.
EXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY Rain pounds the windshield as we watch him expertly add vodka to a half-full bottle of orange juice.
EXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY WHIP gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink.
EXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY WHIP takes another drink before re-capping the bottle and stowing it in the glove box.
EXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY WHIP gets out and we watch him walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar.
EXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY A SECURITY GUARD meets him and takes him inside.
INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY WHIP is now alone in the huge, brightly lit hangar.
INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY He sees the plane.
INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY The JR-88 has all of its pieces laying as close together as possible.
INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY Like the skeleton of a T-Rex in a museum.
INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY The sight is awesome, breathtaking.
INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY WHIP walks closer to the twisted wreck and stops.
INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY WHIP is overwhelmed by the sight and as he is about to leave...
INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY CHARLIE steps out of the passenger door and calls down to
CHARLIE Here's our guy.
CHARLIE C'mon.
CHARLIE WHIP walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the plane where the door used to be.
CHARLIE CHARLIE stands at the top of the ramp.
CHARLIE Suddenly HUGH steps out of the plane...
HUGH Captain Whitaker, we've won.
HUGH WHIP doesn't move as HUGH starts down the ramp.
HUGH (CONT'D) This is what we call in my profession a "walk over."
CHARLIE They've scheduled the hearing.
CHARLIE It's in 10 days.
CHARLIE CHARLIE and HUGH reach the bottom of the ramp.
HUGH But these hearings can be tough.
HUGH You just need to stay sharp and on course and answer the questions correctly.
HUGH It's no longer a question of your condition but the condition of the plane.
This picks directly at the scab of WHIP's guilt.
HUGH (CONT'D) I've had an "Act of God" successfully added to the list of probable causes.
WHIP Look, it's simple.
WHIP I flew a broken plane.
CHARLIE You got it.
CHARLIE That's right.
WHIP And what about my toxicology report?
HUGH I killed it.
HUGH They have no physical proof that you were intoxicated on that plane.
HUGH And no eye witness claims.
HUGH But there's a problem.
This stops WHIP cold.
HUGH (CONT'D) Because of the turbulence at the beginning of the flight and then the crash, there was never any drink service on the flight.
HUGH (CONT'D) But, they found two little vodka bottles in the galley trash bin.
HUGH (CONT'D) There was no physical evidence found on the bottles, no DNA, no finger prints.
HUGH (CONT'D) But both the bottles were uncapped and empty.
HUGH (CONT'D) The only people who had access to those bottles and could have drank them were the flight crew.
HUGH (CONT'D) Margaret, Evans and Camelia Satou all had clean tox reports.
HUGH (CONT'D) That leaves you and Trina Marquez.
They let that land.
WHIP nods.
WHIP Okay.
WHIP I see...where this is going.
WHIP That's funny that they found two bottles.
HUGH Why?
WHIP Because I drank three.
WHIP One's missing.
HUGH explodes in frustration.
HUGH LANG When I met you I couldn't believe what a flip, drunk, arrogant scumbag you were.
WHIP Fuck you too, Hugh.
HUGH LANG But I did the research and heard the analysis from the experts.
HUGH LANG I'm in awe of what you did.
WHIP Can I go now?
HUGH gets big as he has to add the final piece of credence to the coronation.
HUGH is so loud and emotional even WHIP lends focus.
HUGH LANG (CONT'D) Do you know how many were able to safely land these broken planes?
Everyone waits for the response as HUGH acknowledges the debris around them...
HUGH LANG (CONT'D) Not one.
HUGH LANG (CONT'D) Every pilot crashed and killed everyone on board.
WHIP Yeah.
WHIP So?
HUGH You have no capacity to accept the responsibility for the miracle you performed and the lives you saved.
WHIP Great.
WHIP I'm going home.
WHIP pulls out his cigarettes and frees a smoke from the pack.
HUGH LANG Do you want to go to prison?
HUGH LANG I'm trying to save your life!
CHARLIE steps between them as this exchange spirals.
WHIP What fucking life?!
WHIP Don't kill yourself on my account, Hugh.
WHIP starts to walk away.
HUGH Okay, I'm done here.
HUGH I'm running out a faith that this guy's gonna make it, Charlie.
WHIP You wanna talk about me like I'm not here?
WHIP Like I'm fucking dead?
HUGH This NTSB hearing is a Federal Agency Hearing.
HUGH Do you understand that?
HUGH It's in 10 days and if I show up with you like this?!
WHIP turns and walks.
HUGH wheels on CHARLIE and lights him up.
HUGH (CONT'D) Everything we've done?
HUGH (CONT'D) Everything I've done?
HUGH (CONT'D) Goes out the window.
HUGH (CONT'D) That's not on me.
HUGH (CONT'D) I did my job.
HUGH (CONT'D) It's your job, Charlie, to get him straight and get him to the church on time.
WHIP Yeah Charlie just get him home.
WHIP Sober him up long enough to save the union's contract and that fat fuck's airline.
WHIP Fuck you.
WHIP I shoulda died on that plane.
106 WHIP walks away from them -- away from the bright, clean, 106 shiny floor of the hangar and into the growing rain storm.
EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE THE WHITAKER FARM -- DAY The rain has subsided as WHIP pulls up to his driveway.
EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE THE WHITAKER FARM -- DAY Whip turns into the driveway and spots a NEWS VAN in front of his house.
EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE THE WHITAKER FARM -- DAY He makes a U-turn and speeds away.
EXT. NICE MODEST SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAY The rain has completely stopped but everything remains wet as WHIP bangs his front tire in to the curb as he attempts to park in front of a well-maintained house.
111 WHIP checks the mirrors before taking a long drink from a 111 large orange juice bottle.
EXT. NICE MODERN SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- MOMENTS LATER WHIP gets out of his car and makes his way across the street and towards the house.
EXT. NICE MODERN SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- MOMENTS LATER We notice...
EXT. NICE MODERN SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- MOMENTS LATER The DRIVER OF A BLACK PRIUS that has been parked farther down the street gets out of his car, talking on a cell phone.
EXT. FRONT DOOR -- NICE SUBURBAN HOME -- SAME TIME WHIP walks up the steps and knocks on the door.
EXT. FRONT DOOR -- NICE SUBURBAN HOME -- SAME TIME He waits a beat and knocks again.
EXT. FRONT DOOR -- NICE SUBURBAN HOME -- SAME TIME Finally, it opens -- DEANA, an attractive, well-dressed woman in her 40's, stands there staring.
DEANA What are you doing here?
WHIP It's lovely to see you too Deana.
WHIP May I come in?
DEANA takes a moment before stepping aside to allow WHIP in.
WHIP glides into the kitchen of this fastidiously kept home.
WHIP Thought I`d come see you and Will.
KNUCKLES! YOU HERE? We haven't talked at all since this whole thing happened and I just thought we should talk.
DEANA You know that I prefer that you call us.
WHIP Call you?
WHIP Like anyone in this house has called me in the last three years to say anything other than "Where's the money?"
DEANA Have you been drinking?
WHIP Well that took...what?
WHIP 17 seconds?
WHIP It took 17 seconds for you-
DEANA I'm gonna ask you to step outside of the house, please.
WHIP LADIES and GENTLEMEN it took
EXACTLY 17 SECONDS FOR DEANA COLEMAN to ask me if I have been drinking!
EXACTLY 17 SECONDS FOR DEANA A NEW WORLD RECORD!
DEANA I'm calling the police.
WHIP You're asking me to leave the house I bought for you?!
WHIP Very good.
WILL I'm telling you to leave.
WHIP turns to see his 16 year old son, WILL, standing at the foot of the stairs near the door.
WHIP William Whitaker, junior.
WHIP The man of the house.
WHIP Nice of you to call me back.
WILL I'm telling you to leave.
WHIP You are?
WHIP Are you the man of the house?
WILL You upset my mother.
WILL You gotta go.
WHIP I'm your father, tough guy.
WILL You're a drunk.
WILL Now get the fuck out!
WHIP You don't know who the fuck I am!
WILL I sure don't.
WHIP What did you say?
WILL I said, "I sure don't."
WILL Why don't you tell me?
WILL Who the fuck are you?!
WILL Who are you?
WILL Huh?
WILL WHO ARE
DEANA now steps between them and pushes WILL towards the stairs as she puts her hand on the doorknob.
WHIP I'm outta here.
WHIP I'm outta here.
WHIP I know where I'm not wanted.
WHIP turns quietly.
He opens the door and walks outside to find...
WHIP is completely caught off guard.
They step right onto the tiny landing with him.
Through the fracas we hear a variety of questions lobbed at
DEANA'S PORCH REPORTER #1 How come you won't talk to the press?
DEANA'S PORCH REPORTER #2 A lot of people are going out of their way to keep you out of the media, are you hiding something?
We hear the squelch of a police siren as a COP CAR lands on the scene.
DEANA'S PORCH REPORTER #3 Do you still live here, Captain Whitaker?
DEANA'S PORCH REPORTER #1 How well did you know Katerina Marquez, the flight attendant that died?
A REPORTER trips down the stairs.
WHIP grabs one of these news rats and just before pounding him, he breaks in to a relaxed smile.
WHIP Folks, please give us some room.
WHIP At the appropriate time I will tell my story.
WHIP Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured.
WHIP Thank you.
WHIP I appreciate your interest in me but I ask that you leave my family in peace.
The GALLERY quiets to listen and record his words.
WHIP again is incredibly smooth and intuitive while drunk and under pressure.
We can hear the squawking of POLICE SIRENS approaching.
WHIP starts to head down the porch and the frenzy erupts again.
119. The POLICE begin to disperse the NEWS RATS.
119. WHIP pulls an officer aside.
WHIP I'm Captain Whitaker, I was-
YOUNG COP Yes sir, I know who you are.
WHIP Can you get me to my car?
YOUNG COP Anything you need, sir.
YOUNG COP WHIP walks with the YOUNG COP who shields him from the fray.
INT. WHIP'S BUICK -- DEANA'S STREET -- MINUTES LATER We can see the YOUNG COP standing in front of the driver side door, shielding WHIP from the press who stay away.
116 WHIP exhales, trying to slow his racing heart and head.
He's
116 drunk but controlled.
116 He looks at his hands.
116 They are shaking.
INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -- OFFICE - CLOSE ON TELEVISION - NIGHT We see WHIP on the TV repeating the speech he gave reporters on DEANA's front lawn...
WHIP Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured.
WHIP Thank you.
WHIP I appreciate your interest in me but I ask that you leave my family in peace.
WHIP A REPORTER now wraps up the piece...
TELEVISION A reasonable request from a quiet, heroic man who's been through so much.
TELEVISION This is Tilda Banden reporting from Devonwood.
TELEVISION Now a DESK ANCHOR changes stories...
DESK ANCHOR In a related story, tonight at 10 Cale Rawson talks with aviation experts to see if the tragedy of flight 227 could have been avoided.
We boom down to find WHIP who looks drained as he sits on CHARLIE's couch in the fastidiously neat office.
WHIP holds an unlit smoke.
The WOODEN POCKET DOORS SLIDE OPEN and CHARLIE's WIFE gestures towards WHIP.
WHIP stands as CHARLIE enters.
WHIP Hey, Charlie.
WHIP Thank you.
WHIP Amanda was so nice to let me in.
WHIP It's just...I couldn't find a safe place.
AMANDA slides the door shut as CHARLIE throws his bag and his coat down with gusto.
He reaches up and pushes a button on the TV and it goes off.
CHARLIE What the hell is wrong with you?
CHARLIE I spoke to Hugh, he told me that you went to your ex-wife's house?
CHARLIE Drunk as a skunk and the news crews showed up?
CHARLIE And the police escorted you out?
WHIP I think it's okay.
WHIP I've been watching and I think it's okay.
CHARLIE Hugh checked every media outlet that covered it and it looks like we're good.
CHARLIE You come off fine.
WHIP Okay.
WHIP Good then.
WHIP Listen Charlie, here's the deal-
CHARLIE No Whip.
CHARLIE No deals.
CHARLIE Look at you.
CHARLIE I have no idea what you're gonna do or say, ever.
CHARLIE You're all over the place.
CHARLIE I was the one guy in your court.
CHARLIE I was your apologist, your defender.
CHARLIE But not anymore.
WHIP No.
WHIP I can do this.
CHARLIE You're about to be questioned by a Federal Agency about piloting an airliner drunk...an airliner that crashed.
CHARLIE And you continue to drink and stumble around.
CHARLIE What kind of crazy do you have to be to do that?
CHARLIE I'm scared of you.
WHIP Let's just stick to the plan.
CHARLIE You can't stick to anything.
WHIP This whole thing has just been so heavy, it's killing me.
WHIP Tell Hugh, I can do it.
WHIP Look, I really wanna fly again, get back to my life and be done with all this shit.
CHARLIE This hearing is 10 days away.
CHARLIE Hugh busted his ass to try to get you excused, but there's no way.
CHARLIE You have to appear.
WHIP Let me stay here.
WHIP They have my houses all staked out now.
WHIP Let me stay here until the hearing, Charlie.
WHIP I won't leave the house.
WHIP CHARLIE takes a long look at his old, troubled friend.
CHARLIE You can't drink here, Whip.
CHARLIE You can't drink in my house.
CHARLIE Can you do that?
WHIP I won't drink.
118 CHARLIE nods, hoping that WHIP can deliver on that promise 118
We watch a can of Coca Cola swing in WHIP's hand.
We pull out to find WHIP walking with CHARLIE down a hallway of THE ST.
JEROME HOTEL.
Time has passed as WHIP looks the best we've ever seen him look.
He is well rested, well dressed and carrying a suit in a wardrobe bag.
As we approach the open door to a guest room, HUGH pops out.
A plain clothes SECURITY GUARD follows HUGH out of the room and stands behind him.
HUGH You look great, Whip.
HUGH I mean that.
WHIP Thank you.
WHIP I feel really good.
HUGH I heard you haven't had a drink in 8 days.
WHIP 9 days...
WHIP Two hours and 26 minutes...but who's counting?
CHARLIE addresses the SECURITY GUARD.
CHARLIE Officer Edmonds?
OFFICER EDMONDS Yes sir.
CHARLIE Whip, Officer Edmonds will be staying here tonight.
CHARLIE Any problems he'll handle it.
HUGH stands by the open door and gestures CHARLIE and WHIP inside...
HUGH walks in to the center of the room and turns to WHIP.
HUGH Well, Whip we just wanted to make this as easy for you as possible.
WHIP puts his wardrobe bag down on the bed.
CHARLIE Just get a good night's rest.
CHARLIE Relax, order up a steak, get a movie.
WHIP is checking his phone.
HUGH gestures to CHARLIE for him to leave so they can be alone.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Okay, cowboy, I'm out.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) The hearing starts at 10, so we should plan on 9 for breakfast here in the room.
WHIP Wait, Charlie, thanks for letting me stay with you.
WHIP I needed it.
CHARLIE You did great cowboy.
WHIP You've got a beautiful family.
CHARLIE I'm very blessed.
CHARLIE leaves and HUGH joins WHIP at the window.
HUGH hands WHIP a thick folder.
HUGH LANG I made you a copy of my entire file on you and the investigation.
HUGH LANG I also tried to anticipate what you might be asked under oath and I wrote out some non-damaging responses.
HUGH LANG It's all in there; photos, testimony, interviews...I called Ellen Block let her know that you're here and all tucked in.
WHIP So does she have the knife out for me?
HUGH LANG Remember she's limited in what she can ask you.
HUGH LANG You're not on trial but you are under oath.
HUGH LANG She's probably not happy that I killed the tox report, but you'll be fine.
WHIP laughs a little.
HUGH LANG (CONT'D) I'll see you in the morning.
The two respectfully nod.
HUGH leaves and the door shuts behind him.
WHIP puts the folder on the table and steps to the mini-bar.
He bends down and opens the fridge...
WHIP sees the fridge is overly stocked with soda and juices.
Every soft drink you can imagine.
No booze, anywhere.
WHIP chuckles about the alcohol removal as he grabs a coke.
WHIP unbuttons his shirt and pulls it out of his waist line.
Whip sits on the edge of the bed eating a room service steak.
The File Folder sits on the table.
Now in his undershirt and shorts, Whip lies propped up on the bed watching television.
The File Folder now rests on the bed.
Whip is meticulously shaving.
He stares a long while at the disposable razor as the water runs over its blade.
After a moment he goes back to shaving.
Whip sits at the small table looking through the file.
He leafs through photos, with no recognizable emotion.
He looks to the clock radio -- 12:37.
We hear the shower running and steam fogs the mirrors.
WHIP wears boxers and a tee shirt with a towel around his neck.
He looks to the clock -- 2:07
WHIP lays the suit out neatly on the couch, separating the shirt which he hangs from a light fixture to relax any creases.
The room is dark.
A soft wind RATTLES the window sash.
WHIP lies on the bed.
He sighs, sleep is alluding him and the anxiety of tomorrow's events on no sleep has his head spinning.
He hears a metallic click.
He stays quiet to listen for it...there it is again.
An annoying click.
The clock reads "3:43"--
He sits up and switches on the LIGHT.
He rubs his eyes and goes to the table and sees the file folder laying there.
As he is about to pick it up he hears the metallic click again.
He goes to investigate.
The connecting door is unlocked.
WHIP arrives and waits.
He now watches as the connecting lock-bolt CLICKS against the frame -- the door swinging in a draft.
He looks up to see the culprit -- a heating vent.
WHIP flips the vent closed.
Whip now pushes the door with his finger, opening it a few inches.
Nothing.
Darkness.
WHIP Hello?
WHIP Anyone?
Whip enters.
The room is vacant.
The bed is made.
The drapes are pulled open.
WHIP walks quietly on the carpet towards the window.
The night is clear.
Quiet.
Whip takes in the city lights.
Among the glass and steel office buildings, Whip spots a church spire.
A simple cross is perched on top.
Whip looks at the church, deep in thought.
Then suddenly...
We HEAR A HUM.
THE GENTLE HUM OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR.
WHIP turns from the window and scans the room...
It's the MINI-BAR refrigerator -- HUMMING to life.
Whip stares at the gleaming black box.
The WHIR of the motor seems to get LOUDER.
Calling Whip.
Beckoning him...
Whip looks at the fridge.
His face is blank, His eyes tell us nothing.
Then...
Whip steps toward the box.
CLOSE ON THE MINI-BAR.
Whip swings open the door.
COLORS SPARKLE as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles GLOW like jewels in a chest.
WHIP stares at the "glimmering gems" for a long, long time -- vodka, gin, wine, bourbon.
The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER,
WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the fridge.
He holds up the mini vodka and considers it.
Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White Whiskey.
He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists the tiny cap back on.
With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away.
WE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE.
The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side -- ever so slowly, slowly.
Then suddenly...
WHAP!!!
In a flash, WHIP SCOOPS THE VODKA OUT OF FRAME!!
The ELEVATOR DOORS open and HUGH and CHARLIE step out and head down the hallway.
We follow our guys as they approach WHIP's room, finding OFFICER EDMONDS exactly where we left him -- in front of WHIP's door.
OFFICER EDMONDS stands up as CHARLIE and HUGH approach carrying coffees.
CHARLIE Good morning, how's our man?
OFFICER EDMONDS Not a peep.
CHARLIE knocks on the door and checks his watch as he waits for WHIP to answer.
CHARLIE cocks his head, knocks again.
CHARLIE I think your pilot overslept.
HUGH You didn't let any girls in there last night did you?
OFFICER EDMONDS No sir, not a soul.
OFFICER EDMONDS No one came in or out.
They all wait awkwardly as HUGH checks his watch and knocks on the door.
More silence...
OFFICER EDMONDS (CONT'D) I have a room key.
CHARLIE takes the room key and lets himself in.
CHARLIE carefully enters WHIP's room.
He is spooked by the silence.
HUGH joins him as they take in the room.
The bed looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests politely on the dining table but WHIP is nowhere to be found.
HUGH LANG Did he disappear?
CHARLIE tentatively walks around the empty room, the bathroom, the closet, until he finally sees the adjoining room door.
He turns to HUGH with a surprised look.
CHARLIE Whip?
CHARLIE Hello?
CHARLIE knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door.
No response, so CHARLIE lightly tosses the door open.
CHARLIE looks in to find the scene of the crime.
Smoke still hangs in the air and empty bottles and cans cover every surface in the room.
HUGH joins him...
HUGH Where is he?
CHARLIE Whip?
CHARLIE WHIP!
CHARLIE closes his eyes and says a silent prayer as he heads for the bathroom...
CHARLIE is stopped by the sight of WHIP's lifeless body wedged between the tub and the toilet.
CHARLIE turns WHIP over to see his non-responsive face.
HUGH arrives and freaks out.
HUGH Is he dead?
WHIP Yes!!!
WHIP I'm dead!!!
CHARLIE shows immediate relief that WHIP is breathing.
OFFICER EDMONDS has joined them.
OFFICER EDMONDS Should I get an ambulance?
CHARLIE Yes!
HUGH Wait!...just wait, Charlie...let's think about this.
The two stare at each other and realize they are both breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their predicament.
CHARLIE Get him to the bed...
129. Can you wait outside and don't let anyone in here?
129. Thank you.
EDMONDS leaves.
CHARLIE and HUGH drag WHIP out of the bathroom and flop him on the bed.
HUGH explodes.
HUGH Son of a bitch!
HUGH You worthless motherfucker, what a waste!
HUGH I cleared the decks for you...you piece of shit.
HUGH You just fucked it all up like the piss drunk you are!
HUGH grabs at WHIP's collar and WHIP actually sits up and reaches for HUGH, a nice sign of life from WHIP.
CHARLIE WOAH!!!
CHARLIE WOAH!!!
CHARLIE WOAH!!!
CHARLIE Enough!
CHARLIE pulls HUGH away from WHIP who falls back on the bed.
CHARLIE (CONT'D) What time is it?
HUGH 9:14, the hearing is in 46 minutes.
CHARLIE How much grace do you think we got?
WHIP Amazing grace...how sweet the sound...that saved a wretch like me-
HUGH Shut the fuck up you drunk...
WHIP I once was lost and now I'm found was blind but...now...well I'm still kinda blind.
CHARLIE We probably have an hour before we really need to get him to the hearing and it's just downstairs.
HUGH We need a wheel chair.
WHIP Call Harling Mays.
CHARLIE Harling's got a wheel chair?
WHIP Harling's got cocaine.
HUGH Cocaine?
HUGH Cocaine?!
HUGH HUGH and CHARLIE exchange a desperate look...
HUGH This is fucking insane.
HUGH And criminal.
WHIP 609-237-1184.
WHIP We're in 609 so just...
129 Tell him I need bananas...
129
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING CHARLIE prays for a voice on the other end...it appears...
CHARLIE Harling?
CHARLIE Harling this is Charlie.
CHARLIE I'm a friend of Whip's...yeah.
CHARLIE We need you to do a very early, very discreet...uhm...Whip needs bananas and you need to bring them to The St.
CHARLIE Jerome Hotel downtown...how many bunches of bananas?
CHARLIE 3 is the answer I'm getting -- you will be well compensated...the The St.
CHARLIE Jerome Hotel room 1027...
CHARLIE CHARLIE hangs up and looks at WHIP who is mostly passed out again.
CHARLIE CHARLIE looks to HUGH.
The elevator opens and we see HARLING step from the elevator with his knapsack over his shoulder.
Teva sandals, sunglasses.
WHIP has a towel around his neck as he tries to sip coffee.
CHARLIE sits opposite him at the small table by the window.
The door bursts open, and HARLING storms in.
HARLING MAYS Come mista tally man tally me banana...Whip, what's the deal man you look like you're hurtin' for certain...shut the door, interior lock!
HARLING places a leather doctor's bag on the table.
An anxious CHARLIE reaches for the bag which sets HARLING into a frenzy.
It's quiet as HARLING gives orders.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Everyone except Whip and myself take three steps away from the table.
As they step away, HARLING now pulls a beautiful silver- framed mirror from his bag and a blue coke grinder, he calmly but sternly delivers orders...
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) I need three things.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Two glasses of water, a credit card and a hundred dollar bill.
CHARLIE All I have is a twenty.
HARLING MAYS That'll do.
HARLING MAYS And I need to make a coco puff.
HARLING Tosses a pack of smokes to CHARLIE.
CHARLIE A what?
HUGH takes the smokes from CHARLIE and pulls out a cigarette.
HARLING stops grinding, opens the lid and pours out a nice smooth pile of coke.
He begins a masterful ballet of cocaine manipulation.
HUGH Millions of dollars hang in the balance.
HUGH is removing the last quarter of an inch of tobacco from the end of the cigarette.
CHARLIE They hang on the consumption of a 300 dollar bag of cocaine.
HARLING uses the credit card to groom the coke into neat piles and lines.
He has a system.
WHIP's head sags as he again appears ready to pass out.
HARLING MAYS Okay Whip, just two small whiffs first...one on each side...just a primer.
Using the mirror as a tray, HARLING holds the rolled up 20 dollar bill just above the line of coke.
WHIP slowly manages to place his face in position to ingest the coke.
It's tense as his head wobbles.
He finally zeroes in and snorts the first line.
HARLING quickly switches nostrils.
WHIP sniffs the other side.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Atta boy, head back now.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Swallow.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Water, chief, you!
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Water.
CHARLIE puts the glass of water to WHIP's mouth.
WHIP drinks.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Coco puff...
HUGH hands HARLING the cigarette with a slightly hollowed out tip.
HARLING leans over the coke with the cigarette in his mouth and hoovers up a small pile, sucking the coke through the cigarette.
HARLING sits up, careful to keep the cocaine in the end of the cigarette.
He tips it up and lights it.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Little coco puff buddy.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) C'mon banana man.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Who's the banana man?
WHIP's head levels a look to Harling with a smile that leads us to believe that he is actually making a rally.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Good man, focus up big dog.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Here's the train comin' to you.
HARLING takes a puff and holds it as he extends the cocaine cigarette to WHIP.
WHIP is more nimble now as he cocks his head in acceptance of the cigarette.
WHIP takes a drag and holds it.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Keep it down big dog, banana boat's comin' tell me the banana boat's comin'...
WHIP finally exhales the smoke, HARLING does too.
WHIP smiles.
WHIP The banana boat is here.
HARLING MAYS Nothing can keep you down dog.
HARLING MAYS Nothing keeps the big dog down.
CHARLIE Okay, we gotta go.
HARLING has crafted 4 big lines now, he snorts one himself in record time.
Looks to HUGH and CHARLIE.
HARLING MAYS You guys are up.
HUGH No, I'm good.
HUGH Charlie?
CHARLIE Are you fucking crazy?
WHIP jumps in and sniffs 2 huge lines.
He looks to HARLING.
WHIP Thanks brother, I'm back.
134. HARLING gathers his things, stands and hugs WHIP.
HARLING MAYS I love you man.
WHIP I love you too.
WHIP HUGH and CHARLIE are quiet as they watch the strange but sincere drug-fueled emotion pass between two old friends.
WHIP HARLING eyes CHARLIE before handing him a baggie.
HARLING MAYS There's a gram in here, you paid for it and he might need it.
HARLING MAYS My work here is done.
HARLING MAYS See you all on the dark side of the moon.
HARLING MAYS HARLING leaves and our TRIO exchange looks, "Did that just happen?"
133 The opening bars of Joe Cocker's "Feelin' Alright" crackle 133 just before we see WHIP step out of the hotel room and begin a relatively steady strut down the hallway.
Deja Vu.
Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank him from a few steps behind.
Further back we can see that OFFICER EDWARDS also exits the room wearing latex gloves, carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds any evidence of the debauched night or the morning's resurrection.
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR -- DAY WHIP, HUGH and CHARLIE ride the elevator.
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR -- DAY WHIP is buttoning his shirt and fixing his tie.
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR -- DAY It is miraculous how the coke has revived him.
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR -- DAY A MOM and her 8 year old DAUGHTER get on the elevator.
CHARLIE Morning.
CHARLIE We watch as a small trickle of blood escapes from WHIP's left nostril.
CHARLIE HUGH pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, hands it to WHIP.
HUGH Your nose...
HUGH WHIP accepts the handkerchief and wipes his nose.
HUGH WHIP sees blood on the cloth and tilts his head back.
We now see that there is a mirrored ceiling to the elevator.
WHIP tries to study his reflection in the ceiling as he holds the hankie to his nose.
WHIP begins to wobble and CHARLIE helps him regain his balance.
Our TRIO walk as tall as they can towards the hearing room.
HUGH I'm gonna head in and tell Ellen Block that we're here.
HUGH hustles off as CHARLIE pulls close to WHIP.
CHARLIE You're gonna make it.
CHARLIE Remember, if they ask about your drinking, it's totally acceptable to say, "I don't recall."
WHIP wheels on CHARLIE and unloads with focused anger...
WHIP Do not tell me how to lie about my drinking.
WHIP I've been lying about my drinking my whole life.
As we disappear in to WHIP's weary eyes we hear the distinctive sound of a jetliner screaming through the air.
On TWO LARGE SCREENS we watch the grainy cell phone footage shot by a witness of SOUTHJET FLIGHT 227's final moments in the sky.
ACCOMPANYING the Video is the REAL AUDIO of the cockpit voice recording...
The room has a dais where the NTSB board members sit.
A large blue curtain is the backing for the round NTSB shield that hangs above the proceedings.
A large drop down screen will show images, graph and text as needed by the NTSB.
A confident woman, ELLEN BLOCK, approaches carrying a file which she lays on the podium.
ELLEN BLOCK Those are difficult images to watch.
ELLEN BLOCK For the record, I'm Ellen Block, Hearing Officer for this hearing.
ELLEN BLOCK Captain Whitaker, good morning.
We see WHIP who looks rough but stable in his witness chair.
WHIP Morning.
ELLEN BLOCK What was captured on that video is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact.
ELLEN BLOCK However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute in what is considered a "full pitch nose down" attitude.
ELLEN BLOCK Then at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft.
ELLEN BLOCK The NTSB has created animated simulation that I would like to play at this point.
ELLEN points to the screen...
An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the real audio of the flight crew.
The animation has a split screen that also shows the instruments and printed text of what's being said.
We hear..."
What's your son's name?" "Why?" "The black box" "I love you, Trevor.
Be a good boy, Mommy loves you."
"What are we doing?!
Why would I trim down?!" "We're gonna roll it.
Ready?
Here we go.
I've got control."
That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops and the lights come back up.
We return to the hearing in progress.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) That audio is tragic and compelling.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) I chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment aboard flight 227, wherein you say "We're gonna roll it, here we go, I've got control."
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) You made a very conscious decision to invert the airplane, to roll the plane upside down.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) Is that correct?
WHIP I'm not sure it was conscious.
WHIP It was more of an instinct.
ELLEN BLOCK What led to that decision?
WHIP is clearly struggling in his chair.
The coke got him there but it may start to fail him soon.
WHIP I don't recall.
ELLEN BLOCK Let me quote from an investigative summary..."
ELLEN BLOCK From 9:34 until 9:42 the events on the aircraft are"...again I quote, "bold and remarkable"...
ELLEN BLOCK "By inverting the plane, Captain Whitaker arrested the descent and allowed the aircraft to level off enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field.
We hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions are remarkable.
WHIP I heard a metallic bang.
WHIP We pitched nose down.
WHIP No control.
WHIP looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still coursing through his exhausted frame.
ELLEN BLOCK You had no idea what was wrong with the aircraft?
WHIP There was a lot of things wrong with that aircraft.
WHIP glances towards HUGH and CHARLIE who are poker-faced.
ELLEN BLOCK As I said before you can add any details you like to any comments I make.
ELLEN BLOCK Do you remember any thing else that was out of the ordinary?
ELLEN BLOCK Did you feel the flight crew was in their best shape?
WHIP takes a minute to digest this question.
WHIP Yes.
ELLEN BLOCK It was raining very hard the morning you took off, wasn't it?
WHIP There was some convective activity in the area.
WHIP However, my first officer and I discussed the conditions on the field and determined that we were safely within our visibility and crosswind minimums.
ELLEN BLOCK Yes, first officer Evans' testimony confirms the same.
WHIP goes quiet as ELLEN BLOCK looks at him over her glasses, seeing if he has any reaction.
WHIP smiles.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) I want to show you something.
HUGH is frozen in a steely gaze; CHARLIE seems to hold his breath.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) Nothing's happening.
ELLEN points her remote at the projector but it doesn't work.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) This remote is not working.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) Apologies.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) I can do it manually.
She shrugs and heads down onto the stage closer to WHIP where she can advance the slides by touching the projector.
We now see a screen where a slide is showing a long metal screw the size of a trombone.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) This is the jackscrew on the tail assembly which articulates the horizontal stabilizer--also known as the elevator.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) As you can see, the threads on this screw are almost entirely gone.
139. Substandard thread life" is how we reported it.
139. This part was suggested as a maintenance replacement in January of 2010.
139. It was never replaced.
139. This had 1200 additional hours of flight on it.
139. It finally failed.
We watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) Our investigators have concluded that the jackscrew snapped and the elevator was frozen in a fixed position, locking the elevator in a down position which forced the plane into a dive.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) The loss of the elevator was, and I quote our report, a "catastrophic event, from which recovery was improbable and stable flight impossible."
Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate.
ELLEN's tone changes as she understands how hard this is for some people to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last living minutes on this earth in sheer terror.
It is deathly quiet in the ballroom.
Even the PRESS are silent.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) Again I quote..."
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) From 9:34 until 9:42 the piloting decisions made by Captain Whitaker were bold and remarkable.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) The fact that Captain Whitaker commanded that the aircraft stay inverted while descending to an extremely low altitude shows a miraculous intuition that in this instance saved 96 lives."
A genuine applause spreads from the hearing room.
ELLEN BLOCK allows this moment to happen.
WHIP is fading, dazed and uncomfortable with the unexpected adulation.
He stands up.
WHIP I appreciate that.
The room gets quiet as WHIP's demeanor seems terse.
WHIP stares at ELLEN, white with sweat and chemicals.
We see HUGH grind his jaw as this line of questioning has him on tilt.
ELLEN BLOCK Mr. Whitaker, I want to talk about the days leading and hours leading up to the accident.
ELLEN BLOCK But before I do, I want to remind you that you are under oath and any testimony that you give here today will be considered admissable in any subsequent hearings or criminal proceedings, do you understand what that means?
WHIP nods.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) Captain Whitaker, for the record I need you to verbalize your answer.
WHIP Yes, I understand.
ELLEN BLOCK On the three days leading up to the day of the accident -- Tuesday, October 11th, Wednesday, October 12th or Thursday, October 13th of 2011 -- did you consume any alcohol or other intoxicating elements?
WHIP takes his time.
WHIP No.
WHIP I did not.
Sit stone faced in the second row feeling the relief of months of hard work.
ELLEN BLOCK continues with a rote posture...
ELLEN BLOCK On the morning of the accident, Friday, October 14th, did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job?
WHIP No.
WHIP I did not.
ELLEN wraps up this line of questions...
ELLEN BLOCK Mr. Whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug addiction?
WHIP waits for her to look at him...this takes a while...
WHIP No.
HUGH maintains a poker face; CHARLIE appears relieved.
ELLEN sorts through her notes one last time.
ELLEN BLOCK Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done.
ELLEN BLOCK Due to the severe turbulence during the early part of the flight, you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane.
ELLEN BLOCK Is that correct?
WHIP Yes.
WHIP I suspended the drink service.
ELLEN BLOCK Are you aware that our investigators found two single- service Vodka bottles in the galley trash bin?
Slides now show the TWO SMALL VODKA BOTTLES in evidence.
WHIP Yes.
ELLEN BLOCK There were 5 crew members on board the flight who would have had access to the beverage trolley.
ELLEN BLOCK Less than an hour after the accident, blood was taken from each of the crew members.
ELLEN BLOCK Yourself...
A SOUTHJET CORPORATE PHOTO OF WHIP pops on to the large monitors.
After ELLEN references a member of the flight crew, their photo pops on to the monitors...
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) First Officer Evans, flight attendant Margaret Thomason and posthumously from Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez.
KATERINA MARQUEZ PHOTO does not pop up on the screen...yet.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) A toxicology analysis was performed and three of these tests came back negative, one was disqualified for technical reasons...
Hugh smiles -- satisfied.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) And one tested positive for alcohol.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) It registered a .17 blood alcohol level.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) Are you aware of that?
WHIP I am now.
ELLEN BLOCK Miss Marquez was not only a colleague, but you knew her outside of work?
ELLEN BLOCK Correct?
WHIP Outside of work?
WHIP Not really.
ELLEN BLOCK Did you know Miss Marquez had a drinking problem?
WHIP No.
WHIP I did not.
ELLEN BLOCK Did you ever see her drink to excess?
WHIP No.
WHIP I did not.
ELLEN BLOCK Did you know that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction?
ELLEN BLOCK The last time was 16 months ago and paid for by SouthJet Airlines?
WHIP No.
WHIP I did not.
A picture of Trina's beautiful smiling face FLASHES UP ON THE
ELLEN BLOCK Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank the vodka on the plane?
WHIP smiles at the photo of TRINA as if she can see him.
He then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great spirit.
He gets serious as he bears his look down on ELLEN.
WHIP Can you repeat the question?
ELLEN BLOCK Your opinion Captain.
ELLEN BLOCK Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight?
Whip shakes.
He runs his trembling hand through his hair.
WHIP I'm sorry.
WHIP My what...
ELLEN BLOCK Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissable in this hearing, and she in fact tested positive for alcohol, is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those 2 bottles of vodka on the flight?
Whip drops his head and MUTTERS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) I'm sorry Mr. Whitaker, I couldn't hear you.
ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D) What did you say?
WHIP I SAID...God help me...
A confused MUMBLE rises in the room.
Whip's response flusters ELLEN for a moment, but she recovers quickly.
ELLEN BLOCK Yes, well.
ELLEN BLOCK However, is it your opinion...
Whip cuts her off...
IT'S MY OPINION... It's my opinion...
IT'S MY OPINION... Trina DID NOT...drink the vodka.
ELLEN BLOCK Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker...
WHIP She saved that boy's life...
ELLEN BLOCK Captain Whitaker can you speak
Whip stops.
His whole body trembles, his face tightens.
He looks right at ELLEN...
WHIP (CONT'D) ...because I did.
WHIP (CONT'D) I drank the vodka.
The crowd gasps, unsure of what they just heard...
CHARLIE rockets out of his chair.
NTSB OFFICER #2 Please be seated sir.
NTSB OFFICER #2 This is not a court room.
Now CHARLIE returns to his chair to find that HUGH is gone.
CHARLIE looks around for HUGH, no sign.
He's vanished.
WHIP leans close to the microphone.
WHIP I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.
ELLEN BLOCK Mr. Whitaker, in light of that remark, would you like to readdress...
WHIP You don't have to readdress anything.
WHIP I DRANK THE VODKA!
ELLEN BLOCK On the three nights before the accident, October 11th-
WHIP On October 11th, 12th and 13th and 14th I was intoxicated.
WHIP I drank alcohol on all of those days.
WHIP I drank to excess.
Chaos erupts further as REPORTERS outnumber SECURITY.
Flash bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee.
ELLEN BLOCK Mr. Whitaker, on the morning of
WHIP I was drunk.
WHIP I'm drunk right now, Miss Block...I'm drunk right...
WHIP I'm drunk now, because...
WHIP Because I'm an alcoholic.
We have pushed into a tight shot on WHIP's face as the sound in the room fades away.
We stay tight on WHIP's face as he lets the moments unfold.
Suddenly the noise cuts to silence.
WHIP is looking at the assembly.
WHIP wipes tears from his eyes.
We hear WHIP's voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face.
WHIP (V.O.) That was it...I was done.
WHIP (V.O.) It's as if I'd hit my life long limit for lies.
A new angle shows WHIP speaking these words...
WHIP I could not tell one more lie.
WHIP And maybe I'm a sucker.
WHIP Because if I had just told one more lie?
WHIP I could have walked away from that whole mess and kept my wings and my false sense of pride and most importantly I would have avoided being locked up here with all of you nice folks for the last 13 months.
We hear laughter as we pull out from WHIP to realize that he is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an AA meeting in a Federal Prison.
WHIP (CONT'D) It looks like I will serve every day of the remaining 4 plus years of my sentence.
WHIP (CONT'D) And that's fair.
WHIP (CONT'D) I betrayed the public trust.
WHIP (CONT'D) I did.
WHIP (CONT'D) That's what the judge explained to me.
WHIP (CONT'D) I had betrayed the public trust.
WHIP (CONT'D) The FAA took my license.
WHIP (CONT'D) And that's fair.
WHIP (CONT'D) The chances of me flying again are slim to none.
WHIP (CONT'D) And I accept that.
A large room houses an AA meeting for about 50 inmates wearing white jumpsuits.
WHIP continues his story.
WHIP I've had time to think about all of it.
WHIP Doing a lot of writing.
WHIP I've written letters to each of the families that lost loved ones on my flight.
WHIP Some were able to hear my apology, some never will.
WHIP I've also apologized to all the people who tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen, like my wife, I mean my ex wife...
WHIP ...and my son.
WHIP Again, some were able to forgive me...some never will.
WHIP But at least I'm sober, and I'm grateful for that.
Whip gives it to us straight...
WHIP (CONT'D) And this is gonna sound really stupid coming from a man who's in prison...but for the first time in my life...I'm free.
We hold close on WHIP's face as we hear the metallic clang of prison doors shutting.
On the sound we cut to...
We pan across the concrete cell wall, looking at a small, personal photo collage.
We see a photo of NICOLE and SHEILA and a few other AA FOLKS surrounding WHIP who sits in front of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison.
We see a photo of WHIP's DAD as an airman.
We ultimately land on a photo of NICOLE.
We recognize it as the photo WHIP took on the porch of the Whitaker Farm.
We pan down to find WHIP writing in a journal.
A GUARD comes to the front of his cell.
GUARD Whitaker, you got a visitor.
WHIP looks at the GUARD and nods before taking a last glance at the photo of NICOLE.
WHIP sits at a lone picnic table in a fence-enclosed courtyard.
He checks his watch and looks up.
WHIP stands and walks towards us, towards his visitor.
As he gets closer we see a smile break across his face.
A smile we haven't seen since he first saw NICOLE.
We reverse to see...
WILL -- WHIP's 17 year old son stands next to a GUARD.
GUARD You have 40 minutes.
WHIP Knuckles, you're looking good.
WHIP I sent you something for your birthday.
WILL Yeah.
WILL I got it.
Another beat as they can't find a way in to a conversation.
WHIP This is a real surprise; a great surprise.
WHIP I haven't seen you-
WHIP chokes up.
WILL nods.
It's intense.
WHIP motions to the table and they both sit.
WILL pulls out a notebook.
WILL College counselor thought I should come and interview you.
WHIP Great.
WHIP An interview.
WHIP Okay.
WILL I'm writing essays for college applications.
WHIP studies him and laughs...WILL nods and tries to smile.
WHIP Listen Will, it means everything to me that you came here.
WHIP You are an amazing kid and you deserve great things...
Again WHIP has to tamp down his emotions.
WILL So can you help me with this essay?
WHIP Yeah.
WHIP Of course.
WILL pulls out a small voice recorder and clicks it on...
WILL This essay.
WILL I have to do an essay called, "the most fascinating person I've never met."
The two men just look at each other.
WHIP And that's me?
WILL nods, both men are struggling to keep it together.
WILL Can we pick up where we left off?
WHIP nods, unsure as to where this is going.
WHIP Okay.
WILL Who are you?
WHIP Good question.
WHIP smiles...a great, familiar question.
He begins to alternately laugh and sob as there is great relief in the promise of a connection with his son.
