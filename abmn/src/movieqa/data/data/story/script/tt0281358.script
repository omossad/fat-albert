A young man's V.O.:
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) I was born in Beaufort, North Carolina.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) A place where the air always smells of pine and salt and sea.
The voice is gentle.
Slightly Southern in inflection.
A young doctor's soothing manner.
A vast view of the coastline in winter -- beaches, rivers, sea marshes, inlets -- ebbing and flowing.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) For many, days and nights are spent fishing Pamlico Sound or crabbing the Neuse River.
The CAMERA FINDS a small coastal town, edged by a harbor on which fishermen toil.
The CAMERA, MOVING inland, CROSSES OVER modest houses decked with plastic rooftop Santas...
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) While the ocean may be the focus of daily labor, churches have always tried to be the focus of life.
And MOVES UPHILL TO...
Where fake snow is sprayed on store windows.
The CAMERA CONTINUES TO the far side of Main Street -- with its stately homes with big lawns, flower beds, and tasteful Christmas garlands.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) When I lived here, there were eighteen churches within town limits alone.
From each corner, four churches face each other.
The Fellowship Hall Christian Church, the Church of the Forgiven People, the Church of Sunday Atonement, and All Saints Church.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) They sponsored pancake breakfasts, rummage sales, car washes, and softball games.
The CAMERA FINDS and FOLLOWS a newish sport utility vehicle with MD plates as it passes a rummage sale and a softball game.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) You'd think that all the people here were friendly, welcoming, open-hearted...
Dr. LANDON CARTER, 33, drives the truck.
Landon looks urban, prosperous, well-groomed -- but retains his boyish whimsy and sense of irony.
A cell phone and overnight bag on the seat next to him.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) ...
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) and that money or family background or education or luck didn't matter.
Landon reaches out to adjust his side mirror, revealing a simple gold wedding band on his left hand.
Landon's truck turns the corner and slows in front of the huge Southern Baptist church.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) But they did matter.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) They mattered to everyone.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) Except Jamie Sullivan...
Landon's truck turns into a driveway just past the church and heads for a cluster of buildings.
Behind the buildings, a cemetery.
The truck pulls up in front of the old parsonage -- it's a different color than he remembers.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) ...
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) Astronomer.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) Actress.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) Believer in God...
Landon hesitates a moment, then climbs out of his truck.
Landon heads up the walk and onto the front porch.
Presses the DOORBELL.
It RINGS inside.
Landon is edgy, unsettled.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) ...
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) Believer in me.
A nurse opens the door.
ROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as "Born in the U.S.A."
Students hang.
Brains, preps, richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks.
Mixing without mixing.
Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted.
A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX.
Missing are the criminals...
A shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up.
Stops, TIRES SQUEALING.
VAN HALEN BLASTING.
LANDON, 18, at the wheel.
He is impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage to act on destructive whims.
He is envied, copied, feared.
EMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor.
A tiny plastic skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror.
Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray.
LANDON Where is he?
LANDON He's supposed to be here.
ERIC I need to whizz.
ERIC's skinny, high-energy.
A leg always jiggling.
LANDON Eric.
LANDON You're such a hummingbird.
BELINDA I wanna dance.
BELINDA is Landon's girlfriend.
Richie princess, a bad- girl pretender.
Big shoulder pads.
Jellie bracelet.
Swatch watch.
LANDON So go dance.
BELINDA With you.
LANDON I.
LANDON Don't.
LANDON Dance.
ERIC Dee plane.
ERIC Dee plane.
They laugh.
Clay's by the dumpster.
CLAY, obese, wearing a too-small student monitor vest, is dumping garbage from a trash can.
A loud HONK.
Clay turns to see the Camaro, then turns back to the school, coast clear.
He quickly heaves in the empty trash can as the Camaro pulls up.
Eric pushes a door open.
Empties fall from the back seat.
Clay climbs in.
CLAY Go go go go.
PRINCIPAL ED KELLY, middle-aged, pockmarked skin, Casio calculator watch, exits the gym.
Landon's looking at Kelly in the rearview mirror.
LANDON Kelly.
LANDON He looks like his face caught fire and he tried to put it out with a fork.
Landon inches the car forward, teasing Clay, teasing Kelly.
ERIC He couldn't find his own butt with both hands at high noon in a hall of mirrors.
Sniggering laughter.
CLAY Go!
Landon presses the gas.
The CAR ROARS away.
CLAY Kelly's so old he --
LANDON We're done with that already, bonehead.
Clay smiles, good-natured.
He often misses social cues.
Landon drops Clay's student monitor vest out onto the road.
Another car runs it over.
Mr. Kelly walks over, picks up the vest.
Shakes it.
Frustrated.
Eyes the empty beer bottles by the dumpster.
Camaro is parked on the dirt access road, headlights shining through the locked rear gate.
JOHN COUGAR MELLENCAMP's "Small Town" playing.
Landon, Clay, and Belinda sit drinking, smoking weed.
Under the MUSIC, a CB RADIO scanner CHATS quietly.
ERIC So which is it?
Eric finishes taking a leak.
ERIC Landon.
ERIC To save your life, you have to either go deaf or go numb in your dick and balls.
Eric climbs back in the car.
Landon, Belinda, Clay, Eric.
LANDON I'm thinking.
ERIC No thinking.
ERIC The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
LANDON Could I lose one ear and one nut?
ERIC No questions, no negotiating --
BELINDA Where do you get these stupid questions -- ?
LANDON Hypotheticals --
ERIC I'm just wondering --
BELINDA Don't wonder.
Landon's looking out at the night.
LANDON Jamie Sullivan.
Everyone looks up.
Derisive laughter.
A pale, contemplative GIRL, 17, is jumping down off the gate, caught in the headlights.
Wearing clothes she probably made herself; long hair hiding her face.
She lives in her mind, not her body.
BELINDA Brain.
ERIC Bible freak.
LANDON Cherry.
JAMIE (GIRL), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and approaches Landon's window, her SNEAKERS CRUNCHING in the GRAVEL.
She crosses her pilly brown sweater across her chest.
JAMIE Hey.
JAMIE Hi.
JAMIE Your lights.
JAMIE Any chance you could...
JAMIE turn them off --
BELINDA God give you this road?
JAMIE No --
BELINDA Then we'll be keeping the lights on.
LANDON If you want the lights off, I'll turn them off.
And he does.
Darkness.
JAMIE Thank you.
JAMIE Thank you so very much.
She backs away from the car, grateful.
From the car:
BELINDA I can't see a friggin' thing.
Landon switches on the dome lights for Belinda.
BELINDA 'Thank you.
BELINDA Thank you so very much.'
But Landon's looking at Jamie.
Almost counting the seconds...
Jamie scaling the fence, practiced at it.
Landon quickly flicks the high beams.
Belinda, Eric, and Clay snicker and snort as they see --
Jamie, startled, paused at the top.
But instead of looking bullied, her face shows determination, humor even.
A moment later, she jumps down on the far side.
Disappears.
Belinda, Eric, Clay are still laughing.
Landon's smiling.
ERIC Ten years.
ERIC Where're you gonna be?
ERIC Hypothetically?
BELINDA Paris.
CLAY Dead.
Laughter.
LANDON Right here.
LANDON With you.
He clinks Eric's raised beer.
More laughter.
But Landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where he'd really like to be.
CLAY 'Twilight Zone.' 'One Step Beyond.' 'Tales from the Dark Side.'
ERIC 'Twilight Zone,' dipshit.
LANDON Don't call him a dipshit.
ERIC You do --
LANDON And you don't.
LANDON What's she doing in there?
BELINDA Nothing I'd be doing.
Laughter.
Landon kisses her.
With tongue.
A blinding white light dances through the car and settles on Landon and Belinda's faces.
LANDON Shit!
He scrambles out of the car.
Landon looks up at the fence.
Jamie sitting atop, holding a large mirror, reflecting the headlights back into the car.
They stare at each other.
His annoyance turns to mild respect.
The CB RADIO comes to life inside the car.
A GARBLED
BELINDA Landon!
Landon leaps in.
Pops out the Van Halen.
LANDON The address?!
ERIC York Ave.
Landon pops in a WHAM!
tape.
AMPS it UP.
"Freedom."
LANDON What number?
Nobody answers.
LANDON Dildoes.
Landon turns the car around.
The Camaro fishtails away.
TIRES CRUNCHING, red taillights bouncing on the rough road.
The car turns left onto the paved road and speeds out of sight.
Landon drives recklessly.
Rushing.
He makes a SCREECHING turn.
Two fire trucks rumbling by houses, SIRENS WAILING.
Turns right, following the fire trucks.
Landon smiles at Belinda.
She smiles back.
Fun.
Landon takes a slug of beer.
Turns his eyes back to the road.
LANDON'S POV - FIRE TRUCKS make another turn.
Then a flash of light, movement.
A figure on the road.
An old man walking his little dog.
Crossing the street.
INT. CAMARO - LANDON turns the wheel hard.
Jams his foot on the brake.
The Camaro swerves.
TIRES SQUEALING.
A LOUD, HEART-
The old man -- sideswiped, drops to the asphalt.
The CAMARO SLAMS into a light pole.
CRUNCHING METAL.
Quiet.
Landon, Eric and Clay are banged up.
CLAY Christ, man.
LANDON You okay?
ERIC Yeah.
Belinda's head leans on the dash.
Her shoulders shake.
Landon, bleeding on the forehead, reaches over.
Scared.
LANDON Belinda?
She lifts her head.
Looks at him.
She's laughing.
He kicks his door out.
The Camaro crumpled into the light pole.
Headlights askew.
Clay and Eric and Belinda getting out, dazed.
Landon runs to the old man.
Kneels.
Shakes him.
No response.
The man's TERRIER BARKS at Landon.
Frightened, anguished.
The real Landon showing for an instant.
Police SIRENS WAIL in the b.g., growing LOUDER.
A battered Chevette steers through a working-class neighborhood.
Landon's mother, CYNTHIA, 35, drives.
She's weary with sun-worn skin, but still attractive.
She wears a skimpy black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat.
CYNTHIA What if they expel you?
LANDON Kelly wouldn't do that.
CYNTHIA Why not?
LANDON Cuz nothing happened at school.
He smiles his biggest most reassuring smile.
CYNTHIA Don't smile at me.
CYNTHIA It's not going to get you out of this.
LANDON Why not?
LANDON It always has before.
By daylight, a modern brick and glass structure.
Mr. Kelly gestures for Landon to sit.
Landon doesn't.
His forehead still shows a bruise.
MR. KELLY I had hopes for you.
LANDON Like I'd grow up to be president, another Reagan.
MR. KELLY Like you'd make it to June.
MR. KELLY Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
LANDON I'm no dummy.
MR. KELLY That's right.
MR. KELLY You just act like one.
On his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out of the Camaro.
LANDON Those aren't mine.
MR.KELLY They came from your car.
LANDON I wasn't the one drinking.
Kelly holds up the police test finding.
MR. KELLY Your blood alcohol level.
MR. KELLY Maybe you were legally in the clear, but I make the rules here.
Landon scowls, knows he's defeated.
LANDON You expelling me?
MR. KELLY I am.
LANDON Now I can do what I want.
MR. KELLY That's right.
MR. KELLY The world is your oyster.
Landon busts out, arms high, fists tight, like a righteous political prisoner.
Freedom.
He struts through the courtyard.
Not a care in the world.
Landon watches a tow truck lower the crumpled Camaro.
A neighbor kid, JOSH, 12, watches from across the street, on his way to school.
Landon pokes and prods his car -- the engine, underneath, the body, the paint.
A discouraging mess.
Landon knocks on Cynthia's bedroom door.
LANDON Mom.
LANDON I need a ride.
Dark.
She wears a black eye-shield.
Her waitress uniform hangs over a chair.
CYNTHIA I'm not getting up to drive you somewhere.
CYNTHIA What're you doing home?
Landon lifts the garage DOOR.
A murky place.
Filled with old tools and junk and a grim old bike.
Landon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his bike.
No way to carry.
He looks around.
The bus stop.
A bus approaching.
BANGING, RATCHETING, CLINKING.
Landon's working hard.
A BOOM BOX playing SIMPLE MINDS' "Alive and Kicking."
LANDON'S POV - HIS MOTHER'S LEGS and worn terry slippers appear.
CYNTHIA I want to talk to you.
He pauses, annoyed, then rolls himself out.
The mangled front bumper's on the ground.
Cynthia stands there in her bathrobe.
Upset.
Landon's almost too much.
CYNTHIA You're not hanging round here all day.
LANDON I'm not hanging.
LANDON I'm fixing my car --
CYNTHIA You don't need a car you can't drive for a month.
CYNTHIA Go see Marvin.
LANDON 'Bout what?
CYNTHIA About a job.
Landon ignores her.
Slides back under his car.
CYNTHIA He's going to try you as assistant manager.
CYNTHIA You could be manager someday.
Landon can't believe this.
Landon slides back out.
LANDON I'm not working there.
Cynthia sets her jaw.
He knows that look.
Landon is sweating, scouring pots.
A crooked cap on his head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt.
He's making some headway; only two more to wash.
MARVIN, the owner, walks over.
Beer belly, greasy hair.
Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's sink.
Landon glimpses his future.
Landon paces, jumpy.
Kelly's secretary, MISS TARBOX, quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer.
LANDON Who's he in with?
MISS TARBOX He'll be with you when he's available.
The door to Kelly's office opens.
Jamie Sullivan exits with her father, the tall stern REVEREND HEGBERT SULLIVAN.
Jamie eyes Landon as she passes by.
LANDON You expelled, too?
Nobody laughs or even smiles.
Mr. Kelly makes a note in Jamie's file.
MR. KELLY Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
LANDON I want to come back.
MR. KELLY Back?
MR. KELLY Were you ever really here?
They both know Kelly has the upper hand.
Kelly leans back in his chair, relishing it.
LANDON I want to graduate.
Kelly studies Landon, the boy who can't get out of his own way.
MR. KELLY You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
LANDON I'd do that --
MR. KELLY How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
Landon shrugs, clueless.
MR. KELLY Shall I give you a few ideas?
LANDON Please.
MR. KELLY Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
LANDON For pay?
MR. KELLY For the inner satisfaction it will bring.
MR. KELLY Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
LANDON I'm as underprivileged as they are --
MR. KELLY The fact that you attend this school makes you privileged.
His tone quiets Landon.
MR. KELLY Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club.
MR. KELLY Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
LANDON I'd work backstage or something?
MR. KELLY Or something.
MR. KELLY They're doing a play for the holidays.
LANDON When do I get time for me?
MR. KELLY You don't.
MR. KELLY That's the point.
Landon's not happy, but he'll work with this.
As he heads for the door:
MR. KELLY Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.
MR. KELLY Some of us remember how your father --
LANDON Then you remember more than I do.
CLOSE ON BROOM pushing gum wrappers under a radiator.
Landon sweeps at the floor during the Star Club open house.
A dozen nerds, including Jamie Sullivan (wearing her brown sweater), stand at astronomy exhibits.
Students wander in, listen, look.
JAMIE -- Saturn's 15 degrees to the right of red Antares and much brighter.
To her small audience, she holds up a contraption made from a wire coat hanger.
JAMIE This is a very simple device made from a coat hanger, plastic wrap and typewriter correction fluid.
JAMIE Does anyone know what it is?
No one does.
LANDON A star frame.
But Jamie hears.
She regards him a moment, then keeps going.
JAMIE This is a star frame.
Clay and Eric enter, checking on Landon, glancing at Jamie.
JAMIE A star frame will help you locate stars and planets with your naked eye --
CLAY -- Did God create the sun?
JAMIE Yes, God created the universe and all its physical laws.
JAMIE Even Einstein said it's a miracle that our world is comprehensible --
ERIC -- If God can do all that, why can't he get you a new sweater?
Landon laughs loudly.
Members of the club look at him.
LANDON That was a joke.
LANDON Laugh.
Jamie smiles.
She can laugh at herself.
And she finds Landon funny.
Landon washes up while his mother sets the table.
The MICROWAVE HUMS in the b.g.
CYNTHIA Your father dropped off an extra check.
LANDON I don't want his money.
CYNTHIA It could help with a new car --
LANDON -- I like the car I have.
He picks up the envelope with wet hands.
Without looking inside, rips it in half.
Cynthia smiles, quietly happy.
Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing "Karma Chameleon."
Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading, not singing.
She turns around to look at Landon.
He rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a Sony Walkman, glum.
To Z.Z. TOP'S "Sleeping Bag."
Out the window -- Jefferson High School coming into view.
Bars on every window, chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass.
A big room with tables and chairs but few books.
Pairs of heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks.
Landon sits with LUIS, a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity.
A geometry text between them.
LANDON -- 'So what is the measure of angle x if A and B are similar triangles?'
Luis is lost, intimidated.
LANDON Know what 'similar' means?
Luis shrugs.
Luis looks down at the book as if for the answer, then at Landon, hopeless.
He gets up and walks off.
Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie studying him.
She's at a nearby table with her student,
The DOOR SWISHES SHUT behind Landon as he hops aboard.
He's late and heads for the rear bench seat.
Jamie sitting there.
And no vacant seats save next to her.
The bus begins to roll.
Landon lurches forward.
The bus is moving through Beaufort.
Landon sits next to Jamie.
Putting a new tape into his Sony Walkman.
His body turned away.
She's reading her book.
JAMIE You going to visit Harold?
Landon scowls.
What-who is she talking about?
JAMIE They let him out of the hospital yesterday.
JAMIE He's in a rest home on Oak Street.
That old man.
JAMIE He goes to my father's church.
JAMIE He could've died --
LANDON -- This your idea of small talk?
JAMIE I don't make small talk --
LANDON -- Obviously.
JAMIE I just wanted to tell you not to give up.
JAMIE Sometimes you've got to back into the teaching from somewhere else.
If he heard her, he makes no sign.
She goes back to her book.
A long beat, then:
JAMIE What makes you volunteer?
JAMIE Want to know why I tutor reading?
Not really.
JAMIE Because, growing up, books were my world.
LANDON Were?
JAMIE You don't know me.
LANDON Your book and your brown sweater and your hair.
LANDON What's more to know -- ?
JAMIE -- I wear the sweater because I'm cold.
JAMIE I read because no one talks to me.
JAMIE My hair is my hair.
JAMIE What is it exactly that's bothering you?
LANDON You don't care what people say?
JAMIE You mean care what you say?
JAMIE I'm worrying about other things.
LANDON Like what?
LANDON The moons of Jupiter?
JAMIE Can't you have a normal conversation?
LANDON I don't want to have any conversation.
JAMIE Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
She reads again.
The bus pulls to a stop in front of Beaufort High.
Belinda, wearing a neck brace, is waiting, leaning on her Cabriolet.
Jamie watches Landon exit the bus.
Landon greeting Belinda, kissing her.
Landon opens a side door, peers in at the Drama Club.
A big space with a stage.
MS.
GARBER stands before six geeky boys, and a dozen fat girls and Jamie.
Landon reacts -- this girl actually chooses to be in these places?
Ms. Garber looks up from her papers.
MS. GARBER We're waiting, Mr. Carter.
He slides in a row behind the others.
Leans forward and pokes a boy, EDDIE JONES.
Eddie's pimply and talks with his eyes squinched up.
LANDON What's the play?
Eddie hands him a photocopied script, The Rainmaker.
EDDIE The-the-there's this drought an' -- and a smooth t-t-alking guy comes and says he can m-make rain --
LANDON -- And the ugly farmer's daughter falls for him.
LANDON I saw the movie.
EDDIE Yeah.
EDDIE It's really g-g-good --
LANDON -- It blows.
Jamie and Landon sit in folding chairs, reading from scripts.
Landon's wooden, showing how lame this is.
LANDON 'I hope your dreams come true.'
JAMIE 'They won't.'
LANDON 'Believe in yourself and they will.
LANDON Let me ask you, Lizzie.
LANDON Look in the mirror?
LANDON Are you pretty --?'
MS. GARBER -- Landon, are you trying to be bad at this?
LANDON No, it just comes naturally.
Jamie smiles.
Garber taps her script -- continue.
LANDON 'It's got to be inside you.
LANDON Then one day the mirror will be the eyes of the man who loves you.
LANDON You'll look in that mirror and you'll be more than pretty.
LANDON You'll be beautiful.'
Ms. Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going.
LANDON 'Look at me.
LANDON Tell me what you see!'
As Lizzie, Jamie looks into his eyes.
JAMIE 'Is it really me?'
LANDON 'Yes.
LANDON You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Hoots and laughter.
Jamie looks away, humiliated.
MS. GARBER Quiet!
MS. GARBER Landon will play the role of Bill Starbuck.
Groans among the boys.
Jamie is horrified.
So is Landon.
LANDON No way.
LANDON No thanks.
LANDON I can't do it --
MR. KELLY -- You can and you will, Mr.
MR. KELLY Carter.
Kelly's been standing in the wings.
MR. KELLY With all the sincerity and dignity you can muster.
Everyone stares at Landon.
He's trapped.
Raining.
Landon exits behind all the others.
Stands under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for a ride.
Jamie approaches, something on her mind.
LANDON You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
JAMIE -- This play means a lot to me.
LANDON This play -- ?
JAMIE -- I know you don't suck at acting.
Landon laughs.
Refusing to take her seriously.
Behind him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night.
JAMIE But you have to make it a big joke because only dorks and dweebies like doing theater --
LANDON -- What are you going on about?
Pause.
JAMIE I can judge too.
He exhales, eyeing her, daring her.
JAMIE You don't care about classes or graduating.
JAMIE But you like school because you're popular and you know you'll never be on top again.
LANDON That's deep --
JAMIE -- Your act only works with an audience.
LANDON My act?!
She walks off toward her father's old Pontiac.
The last car in the parking lot.
Fire trucks rush by on the street below.
Landon's ears twitch.
He looks about.
No one, no ride.
He sees the Pontiac backing out of a parking spot.
Landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past.
LANDON A ride?!
LANDON Please!
Jamie turns to look at him.
Landon, wet, desperate, his eyes pleading.
LANDON We can talk about your helping me with my lines.
Jamie's at the wheel.
JAMIE I know you don't want help.
LANDON Then we both know.
LANDON I'll point.
LANDON You drive.
LANDON Faster.
He points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks.
The wet road glistens.
JAMIE We're following fire trucks?
LANDON Yeah.
JAMIE Why?
LANDON Because that's where the fire is?
He fishes in his pocket for a tape.
Pulls one out.
He's searching the dash -- no cassette player.
LANDON Fire is like a living thing.
LANDON Wild.
LANDON Unpredictable.
JAMIE Like me.
LANDON No.
LANDON Not like you.
She jerks the car across the center lane.
Driving on the wrong side of the road.
He grips the dash.
LANDON What the -- ?!
JAMIE So you agree you need help?
Headlights looming, a car coming.
Closer and closer.
LANDON Yes!
She swings the Pontiac back to the right lane.
Smiling.
A car zips by in the other direction, HORN BLARING.
JAMIE Really?
Landon drops his attitude, his act.
He toys with the glove compartment knob.
LANDON Yeah.
LANDON Kelly'll make me leave school if I screw up the play.
JAMIE 28 and 42.
Pause.
He acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested.
LANDON What's with the friggin numbers?
JAMIE 28 is do something illegal.
JAMIE 42 is befriend an enemy.
LANDON I'm an enemy?
JAMIE Kinda.
JAMIE Yeah.
Landon and Jamie walk around the fire, watching the fire and the firemen.
Landon is just tolerating her.
JAMIE The reason I got the part...
JAMIE I'm a little like Lizzie.
JAMIE Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
LANDON Good thing.
If she's offended, she keeps it to herself.
LANDON You got some kind of list?
JAMIE Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
LANDON Maybe a little of both.
They both smile.
JAMIE I'll take a chance.
LANDON Go for it.
JAMIE It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
He smirks.
JAMIE If you can't imagine the future, you won't have one.
He lights a cigarette.
She reaches for it.
LANDON Having a cigarette.
LANDON 100.
She grins and takes a drag.
They share the cigarette.
LANDON So what else is on this list?
JAMIE It's private.
LANDON You want to tell me...
She eyes him, not certain she's willing to risk sharing her dreams with him.
LANDON Get very wasted.
LANDON Lose your virginity --
JAMIE Spend a year in the Peace Corps.
JAMIE Make a medical discovery --
LANDON Ambitious.
JAMIE Being negative's a lot more work than being positive.
LANDON Like you'd know.
JAMIE I do know.
JAMIE Be two places at once...
JAMIE learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel...
JAMIE eat breakfast with chopsticks...
He likes the frivolity of these.
LANDON What's...
LANDON Number one?
She looks away, embarrassed.
JAMIE If you want help with your lines, I have two conditions.
JAMIE You have to promise not to fall in love with me.
He's certain she's joking.
LANDON No problem --
JAMIE And you have to meet my father.
He looks at her like she's crazy to worry about this.
LANDON Fathers love me.
CLOSE ON PARSONAGE FRONT DOOR swinging open.
Reverend Sullivan looming tall.
Ichabod Crane in a collar.
Landon gives a cheery little wave.
He's very sweaty.
His bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g.
LANDON Hey.
LANDON Landon Carter.
Landon offers his hand.
The Reverend shakes reluctantly, eyeing him closely: Landon's Army boots, torn jeans, dirty t-shirt, aloof manner.
REV. SULLIVAN You're in the play?
LANDON Lead man.
Jamie slides out the door.
She looks good in jeans and a white t-shirt.
Almost normal.
In the b.g., Landon's BIKE CRASHES over.
He bounds down the porch steps.
LANDON They took my license for 30 days.
LANDON But nobody's pressing charges.
The Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned.
Landon tries the kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed bush.
Not the best place.
JAMIE I'll get something for us to drink --
LANDON Don't bother!
But she's already gone.
The Reverend gestures toward the open front door.
Dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade.
Landon pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie with her parents.
He looks up, aware that the Reverend is studying him closely.
LANDON You know our planet would not suffer for one nanosecond if humans died off.
LANDON But if ants disappeared, that would be catastrophic.
The Reverend waits, letting Landon suffer the silence.
LANDON Apropos of nothing...
LANDON so.
LANDON So so so so --
REV. SULLIVAN Let's get something straight.
REV. SULLIVAN You don't know me.
REV. SULLIVAN I don't know you.
REV. SULLIVAN But I know what you're about.
REV. SULLIVAN Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
His eyes lock with Landon's.
His message clear.
A NOISE and Jamie is there, carrying glasses of lemonade, all cheerful.
JAMIE I miss anything?
Jamie washes the lemonade glasses, happy.
Her father comes in.
REV. SULLIVAN The Carter boy.
REV. SULLIVAN Tell me about him.
JAMIE He wants help with his lines --
REV. SULLIVAN He was driving the car that hit Harold Keene --
JAMIE By accident --
REV. SULLIVAN Jamie, he's careless.
REV. SULLIVAN Reckless.
REV. SULLIVAN Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
JAMIE I'm supposed to always be alone?
REV. SULLIVAN I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
JAMIE Fine.
JAMIE But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
Pause.
REV. SULLIVAN I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
JAMIE Dad, I've become a woman without her.
JAMIE Just not a pretty one.
Jamie hops out of bed, pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt.
Jamie peers into her father's room.
He's sleeping.
She tiptoes to the staircase and down.
Sneaking out.
Landon is waiting when Jamie appears.
He has scripts in his back pocket.
They smile at each other, laugh.
JAMIE I know.
JAMIE Don't say anything.
LANDON He's a softy.
LANDON Got him wrapped around my finger.
JAMIE You think so.
LANDON Know so.
She grins, skeptical.
JAMIE This way.
Jamie leads Landon toward the cemetery rear gate.
JAMIE People think I'm strange, don't they?
LANDON Yes.
JAMIE Because I try to be nice to people?
LANDON Yeah.
LANDON Maybe.
LANDON I dunno.
JAMIE Do you think I'm strange?
Pause.
Landon's caught off-guard by her frankness.
LANDON Yeah.
LANDON But that can be good.
Jamie quickly scales the fence.
Landon's right after her.
LANDON Why are we here?
Jamie drops down.
Takes a flashlight from her bag.
JAMIE Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
LANDON The world of the dead?
JAMIE Could be...
He drops down, not sure what she means.
She's already walking away.
He follows.
JAMIE My mother's buried near here.
LANDON My father's alive but it's like he's dead.
She looks at Landon, feeling his sorrow, then unlocks a storage shed.
Opens the door.
Enters.
Returns a moment later carrying several pieces of an odd-looking home-made cylindrical device.
LANDON What is that?
JAMIE That is my telescope.
The ten-inch Dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky.
The eye-piece is at the end of the long scope; the scope rests on a plywood base.
Landon looks through the eye- piece.
POV (THROUGH TELESCOPE) - CLOSE ON GOLDEN PLANET a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad, flat ring system.
LANDON Saturn.
LANDON Beautiful.
JAMIE Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
LANDON But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
JAMIE Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
LANDON Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
She looks at him.
He smiles, embarrassed.
LANDON I'm not smart.
LANDON Just a sponge.
She smiles, disagreeing, then looks through the telescope and changes its view.
JAMIE Sometimes I come here and just scan the heavens.
LANDON Looking for intelligent life?
JAMIE Looking for something -- someone.
Pause.
He doesn't know what to say.
LANDON Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
JAMIE I hope so.
JAMIE I think maybe she sees me now.
Their eyes meet.
She looks away.
Changes the subject.
JAMIE I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
LANDON The dirty snowball at its core.
JAMIE Yeah.
JAMIE I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
LANDON In 76 years, me neither.
She likes that he knows a little about astronomy.
They each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars.
LANDON You're really into God, right?
JAMIE In ten words or less?
LANDON Yeah.
JAMIE My relationship with God is my own.
LANDON But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
JAMIE Don't you?
LANDON Not really.
Pause.
JAMIE When you do, how do you?
Landon could joke or he could reveal something.
LANDON Like in a church painting.
LANDON I see this giant hovering over the ground.
LANDON He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
JAMIE Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
LANDON No.
JAMIE I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
LANDON There is no point.
LANDON You live.
LANDON You die.
LANDON The end.
JAMIE Maybe we're not supposed to understand, but we're supposed to have faith that someone else sees the big picture.
LANDON You have to believe to have faith.
JAMIE You don't believe in anything?
LANDON The Bible.
LANDON Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
JAMIE Interpreted by another guy like my father.
LANDON Your father doesn't like me.
Pause.
JAMIE He doesn't trust you.
LANDON Sometimes I don't even trust me.
He sits up and pulls Rainmaker scripts from his back pocket.
He holds one out to her.
A moment passes.
She takes it.
JAMIE I'm not afraid of you.
LANDON Likewise.
Jamie sneaks from the stairs to her room.
Shuts the door.
A light glows under the door, then goes out.
He opens his eyes, listens, then turns over and goes back to sleep.
Not suspecting.
Not yet.
Dreary.
Landon lies in bed, flipping the TV CHANNELS, past "Square Pegs," "Miami Vice," MTV, to a British nature documentary.
After a moment, he searches for a pen and paper.
Titles it "Life List."
Pause.
He doesn't know what to write.
Landon, Clay, Eric, Belinda.
Eric's pickup is parked by Belinda's Cabriolet.
RADIOS ON, BLASTING the same station, same song: JOHN FOGERTY's "Rock and Roll Girls."
ERIC Women are definitely evolving into men.
CLAY The moustaches on some girls.
CLAY Unbelievable.
BELINDA Why is Jamie Sullivan staring at us?
They look.
Jamie's watching them.
They laugh.
ERIC She wants to jump Landon's bones.
BELINDA That is so pitiful.
LANDON She's very confused.
CLAY Deluded.
ERIC Deranged.
LANDON Demented.
BELINDA She's coming over here...
LANDON Heart be still.
They laugh more and she's there.
JAMIE Hi.
He doesn't respond.
She shifts from foot to foot.
Confused.
JAMIE The play's going to be really good.
LANDON I'm really glad you think so.
His friends snicker and guffaw.
She looks at them, then back to Landon.
JAMIE I guess you don't want to practice lines tonight.
LANDON You guessed right.
She gives him a funny look and walks away.
A better person than he and he knows it.
BELINDA That's one girl who can't take a hint.
LANDON Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
They laugh.
Landon the loudest.
It feels good, but he also feels a little...
bad.
Cleaned up.
Swept out.
The Camaro is still a dented mess.
But Landon drops its hood down, wipes his hands, and climbs behind the wheel.
The ENGINE STARTS.
No posters of pop stars.
Books by Houston Smith, Thomas Merton, Alan Watts, Carlos Castaneda.
Jamie studies, listening to JONI MITCHELL's "I Wish I Had a River."
The
Jamie opens the front door.
Landon.
A stern voice from the living room.
Reverend Sullivan's.
REV. SULLIVAN Better not be the Carter boy.
Jamie shuts the door.
Landon can't believe this.
He presses the BELL again.
LANDON Jamie?
LANDON Open up.
LANDON Open the door.
LANDON Please.
LANDON Reverend Sullivan, I have to talk to your daught--
JAMIE What is your problem?
She's standing in the front yard.
LANDON You're not in a very good mood.
JAMIE You don't miss a thing.
He steps down off the porch.
LANDON The play's in a couple of weeks.
JAMIE Yes.
JAMIE And?
LANDON I was hoping we could run lines together.
JAMIE Oh.
JAMIE Just not at school...
LANDON Yeah --
JAMIE Or anywhere where people might see us.
LANDON Belinda's a very jealous person.
JAMIE That would be the reason.
Pause.
He thinks she might be going for this.
JAMIE So it's like you want to be secret friends.
LANDON That's it!
LANDON Exactly!
LANDON You're reading my mind --
JAMIE Then maybe you can read mine.
She walks up the porch steps, goes in the front door, and opens it.
Before she goes in:
JAMIE I thought I saw something in you, something good.
JAMIE But I was wrong.
Jamie leans against the closed door, trembling, almost crying.
In the living room, her father looks up from his reading, sees Jamie, then parts the curtains, looks out, glowers.
Landon standing in the front yard, confused that Jamie would reject his generous offer of friendship.
Landon walks to his car, then yells back at the parsonage.
LANDON Why do you have to be so weird?!
The front door opens, startling Landon.
It's the Reverend.
Red-faced with fury.
Landon glares back, but then climbs in his car and drives off.
Ashamed.
Jamie sits on the sofa.
Her father doesn't look up from his reading.
REV. SULLIVAN The first time I met him I knew.
REV. SULLIVAN I'm proud of how you're handling yourself.
Tears well and Jamie's face cracks with guilt and heartbreak.
She leaves before her father can see her distress.
Landon lies in bed watching another British nature DOCUMENTARY, this one on astronomy.
He reaches for his school yearbook.
Flips the pages until he finds Jamie's photo.
She's smiling and looks almost cute.
Listed under her photo are clubs: Red Cross, Stars and Planets, Drama.
Ambition: To Witness a Miracle.
Landon and Luis sit over the geometry text.
Landon has just asked a question and Luis is shrugging sadly.
Landon's eyes wander out the window.
LANDON Let's get outta here.
Landon and Luis face each other across the half-court.
Landon's got a ball and is further from the basket.
LANDON You, me, and the basket.
LANDON We're the three corners of a triangle.
LANDON Take one step in.
Landon and Luis both step forward.
LANDON Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
LUIS Yeah.
LANDON Are you?
LUIS Yeah.
LANDON So what did we just make?
LUIS A similar triangle?
LANDON What else?
LANDON What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
LUIS Scalene?
LANDON Okay.
LANDON Make me an isosceles.
Luis steps outward, directly opposite Landon.
LANDON Yes!
LANDON Two sides the same.
Landon tosses him the ball.
They play.
Jamie glances over from a picnic table where she works with her student, Isabel.
Landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks back.
Thoughtful.
Watching her.
But not staring.
Landon studies the books in the spiritual/religion shelf.
He picks out a book, then sits in a corner.
But before he opens the text, he looks around him, suddenly taking in all the books, all the learning, all the knowledge that could be his.
On the marquee: The Rainmaker.
Under this, "All Invited."
Under this, a full parking lot.
A full house.
Parents, teachers, students, churchgoers, booster club and rotary members.
The set is a wealthy Midwestern ranch house of the 1950s.
Eddie and two other BOYS play other characters.
The play's underway...
Landon watches, dressed as Bill Starbuck in a nicely fitted suit.
Waiting for his entrance.
BOY #1 'Then why don't you talk to her?'
EDDIE 'Because if we do, she'll think we're trying to get rid of her.'
BOY #1 'She'll sure think the same if I do it.
BOY #1 You're her father and comes a time when a father's gotta mention.'
From stage right, Jamie makes her entrance as Lizzie.
A collective gasp from the audience.
Jamie, wearing makeup, a dress that clings, her hair pulled back.
Landon can't take his eyes off her.
JAMIE 'Morning, Pop.
JAMIE Boys.
JAMIE I dreamed we had a rain, rain coming down in sheets!
JAMIE Lightning flashed, thunder rolled up and down the canyon like a kid with a big drum!'
Reverend Sullivan -- enraptured.
Principal Kelly -- hopeful.
Cynthia Carter -- uncertain.
Clay, Eric, and Belinda -- rocking in their seats, snickering.
JAMIE 'I know why you sent me to Sweetriver.
JAMIE Six boys in that family.
JAMIE The first three days, I stayed in my room.'
BOY #2 'What'd you do that for?'
A well-dressed man, DR.
JONATHAN CARTER, Landon's father, slips in and takes a seat a couple of rows behind Cynthia.
JAMIE 'I knew what I was there for and they knew it, too!'
Dr. Carter hangs on every word.
Others sit on the edge of their seats.
Even Clay, Eric, and Belinda.
Belinda leans forward to take a photo.
As she ZOOMS -- Landon and Jamie on stage, growing larger.
Landon, Jamie, and the three boys.
ON STAGE - LANDON is Starbuck.
LANDON '...
LANDON You'll look in that mirror and you'll be more than pretty.
LANDON You'll be beautiful.
LANDON Look at me.
LANDON Tell me what you see!'
Jamie looks.
She sees something in his eyes she hasn't seen in them before.
Love.
JAMIE 'Is it really me?'
Jamie, her face lovely.
Her eyes shining, radiating, looking directly at him.
Landon is dumbstruck.
LANDON 'Yes.
LANDON You're beautiful.'
Landon changes the line and nails it.
Surprising himself.
Surprising her.
They both know it's sincere.
A moment passes.
Her stomach churns with anticipation.
He leans in.
She closes her eyes.
They kiss.
Gently, genuinely.
When Jamie opens her eyes, they are filled with tears.
The curtain crashes down.
End of act two.
CLAPPING from the other side of the curtain.
Landon tries to meet Jamie's gaze.
But she's looking at the floor.
Principal Kelly, pleased.
Cynthia Carter, proud.
Clay and Eric, surprised.
Reverend Sullivan, frowning, concerned.
Belinda's face is cold, hard.
Landon runs out, looking for his friends.
Mr. Kelly shakes his hand, then deals with parents.
Belinda getting into her car.
LANDON Belinda!
Belinda stops.
BELINDA What?!
She waits.
Landon struggles with what to say.
BELINDA That's what I thought!
Landon watches her START her CAR, back from a parking space --
DR. CARTER Landon.
Landon turns.
His father is standing on the curb.
DR. CARTER Fine performance.
LANDON Who invited you?
DR. CARTER Ed Kelly.
DR. CARTER I thought we might get a bite --
LANDON Not hungry.
Landon moves toward his Camaro.
DR. CARTER Landon!
DR. CARTER Please.
DR. CARTER Don't walk away from me.
LANDON Like you walked away from us?
Landon opens his car door and gets in.
Not forgiving.
Landon waits by Jamie's locker.
The BELL RINGS.
No Jamie.
Landon walks along the lunch line, looking.
No Jamie.
Many many books.
Landon cruises the stacks.
No Jamie.
Belinda, sitting at a table with a girlfriend, sees Landon and turns away.
He doesn't pursue it.
Eric and Clay watch Landon hammer out dents in the Camaro.
They're smoking, sharing some beers.
Josh, the neighbor kid, stands across the street, wanting to be invited over.
ERIC She's like some Puritan.
LANDON She's not.
LANDON She's got her own ideas.
CLAY Mutant ideas.
LANDON Maybe to you.
Eric and Clay exchange a look -- is Landon defending her?
ERIC Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
LANDON It was.
Eric and Clay smirk in disbelief.
ERIC And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
LANDON Scamming's a strong word.
Landon's waiting when Jamie approaches her locker.
Her hair pulled back.
She looks good in a simple, fresh way.
LANDON You weren't in school yesterday.
JAMIE I went to the doctor with my father.
LANDON He okay?
JAMIE Healthy as can be.
Pause.
She doesn't help him.
She opens her locker, gets what she needs.
LANDON You were great the other night.
JAMIE Thank you.
JAMIE So were you.
Pause.
He tries to touch her hair.
She ducks.
LANDON I haven't been nice to you.
JAMIE You're hardly nice to anyone.
LANDON I'm sorry.
JAMIE I wish I could believe you.
Jamie sits alone, reading, wearing her old brown sweater.
Landon walks by Clay and Eric at a table.
ERIC Landon!
LANDON Later.
Puts his tray down on Jamie's table and sits.
Making a public statement.
JAMIE People can see.
LANDON And that would ruin your reputation how?
She goes back to her book.
Ignoring him.
LANDON What's that?
She doesn't look up.
Shows him the spine: The Scarlet Letter.
JAMIE I'm reading all the novels on Mr.
JAMIE Rothberg's best American authors list.
LANDON How many books are there?
JAMIE A hundred.
JAMIE Then there's his classics list.
JAMIE And his European list.
Landon realizes this is why she's always reading.
LANDON That on your 'Life List.' To read all those books?
She doesn't deny it.
He just dives in.
LANDON Jamie.
LANDON Maybe I want to try being positive.
She looks up.
Examines his face for the truth.
LANDON Maybe I miss doing that dumb play with you.
Students seated near them have overheard.
Whisper.
LANDON Maybe you inspire me.
JAMIE That sounds like horseshit.
LANDON Which part?
JAMIE All of it.
LANDON It's not.
JAMIE Prove it.
She picks up her books and tray.
Everyone is watching.
LANDON I just did!
Landon follows Jamie out of the building.
Catches up.
LANDON Jamie --
JAMIE You lack honor.
JAMIE You lack compassion.
JAMIE You lack honesty.
JAMIE You lack humanity.
She heads to the old Pontiac.
Landon jogs after her.
LANDON Okay.
LANDON Maybe some of that is true --
JAMIE You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
LANDON I don't want to be just your friend --
JAMIE You don't know what you want --
LANDON You don't either.
LANDON Take a look at yourself.
LANDON Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
JAMIE And why would that scare me?
LANDON Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
She gets into her car.
Slams the door.
STARTS the ENGINE.
She recognizes the truth.
LANDON But the real reason you're scared?
LANDON You like me!
She drives off.
Clay and Eric, watching, guffaw at Landon's spectacle.
LANDON If you were really my friends, you'd be helping me, not running me down.
ERIC The only one running you down is you.
Landon sits alone.
Legs dangling over.
Lighting and dropping matches into the black beyond his feet.
His body caught in the occasional sweep of car headlights.
Nearby, an abandoned car.
A rusty old Yugo.
Landon comes in from outside.
Is surprised to find Cynthia sipping tea, wearing her uniform.
CYNTHIA Out with Belinda?
LANDON That's over.
LANDON Way over.
CYNTHIA I can't know things if you don't tell me.
Pause.
LANDON Dad came to the play.
CYNTHIA You saw him?
LANDON We talked.
LANDON He wanted to get a bite -- after.
LANDON I said no.
CYNTHIA After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had.
CYNTHIA He didn't show, not once.
LANDON He wants to show now.
CYNTHIA You going to let him?
CYNTHIA You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
Landon doesn't answer.
CYNTHIA You do that.
The door is open to a lab where Jamie and the Star Club is meeting.
Landon mops, working hard, while listening in.
Inside, Jamie ignores him.
Mr. Kelly watches from near the trophy case.
Almost approving.
MR. KELLY Mr. Carter.
MR. KELLY Don't wear a hole in that one spot there.
Landon grins and moves on.
Behind Landon's back, Mr.
Kelly peeks into the science lab.
Sees Jamie.
Looks back at Landon.
Wonders.
Landon parks his Camaro.
It's shiny and buffed and perfect again.
A Christmas party for the tutors and tutored.
A ROCK 'N' ROLL CHRISTMAS CD plays.
A raffle ticket box by the door.
A sign reads: "Win Movie Tickets."
Landon enters, buys a ticket, then takes off his leather jacket.
Underneath, a nice shirt and tie.
Across the room -- Jamie, looking pretty in a dress, laughing with her student, Isabel.
Mr. Kelly talking with MR.
REGINALD ADAMS, principal of Jefferson High.
Luis runs over, diverts Landon's attention.
Mr. Adams goes to a microphone.
Taps it.
MR. ADAMS Everyone?
MR. ADAMS Quiet please.
MR. ADAMS As you all know, we're here to celebrate the holidays and to raise money to buy books for our library.
MR. ADAMS The book drive is being led by Beaufort High's Jamie Sullivan.
Applause.
This is new.
Landon looks at Jamie, who's smiling.
She steps to the microphone.
JAMIE Thank you for buying tickets.
JAMIE We've raised two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
More applause.
She steps down.
Off to one side.
LANDON About enough to buy maybe five volumes in a set of encyclopedias.
Luis smiles.
Jamie overhears.
JAMIE It's a start.
LANDON Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
She smiles.
He looks at her.
LANDON So you're talking to me?
JAMIE When I have something to say.
He smiles.
LANDON What's number one on your list?
She shakes her head.
LANDON My number one would be getting out of Beaufort.
JAMIE Getting out won't be your problem.
JAMIE It'll be figuring out what you want when you get somewhere.
She walks away.
LANDON What does that mean?!
JAMIE It means you can do anything.
Landon smiles, not sure why she believes in him.
Hanging on the front door: a simple evergreen wreath with a plaid bow.
Dark save for a gilded fake tree lit with tiny blinking lights and the glow of Cynthia's cigarette in the dark.
CYNTHIA Landon!
CYNTHIA Come enjoy the tree!
CYNTHIA Landon?!
Landon comes down the stairs.
Sits on the sofa.
Wearing another good shirt.
She tries to reach out.
CYNTHIA You look nice.
CYNTHIA I should have dressed.
LANDON You're fine like that, Mom.
CYNTHIA There's hot cider in the kitchen.
LANDON Thanks.
CYNTHIA I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
LANDON Me neither.
CYNTHIA No great loss --
LANDON I need to go out.
Pause.
CYNTHIA To see your father?
LANDON No.
LANDON I won't be long.
He senses her hurt, but leaves anyway.
A Christmas tree with large colored lights stand in a corner.
Jamie and her father playing cards.
The DOORBELL RINGS.
Then urgent BANGING.
JAMIE/REV. SULLIVAN Landon Carter.
Landon slides his backpack off his shoulder.
Pulls out a shopping bag.
Holds it out to Jamie.
LANDON It's a present.
LANDON Take it.
She does.
She opens the bag, pulls out a beautiful pink sweater.
She's overwhelmed.
Without a word, just a happy smile, Landon hops down the steps toward his car.
Reverend Sullivan appears in the doorway.
LANDON Merry Christmas!
LANDON And to all a good night!
Jamie hums to herself as she brushes her hair.
She's wearing the new sweater.
Her father KNOCKS.
Enters.
REV. SULLIVAN What's Landon Carter up to?
JAMIE Up to?
REV. SULLIVAN I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
JAMIE Dad, why don't you get to the point where you get to the point.
REV. SULLIVAN Why is he giving you a gift?
Jamie doesn't answer.
REV. SULLIVAN Did you give him a gift?
JAMIE No.
REV. SULLIVAN I saw the way he looked at you.
REV. SULLIVAN The way he kissed you.
JAMIE It was a play.
REV. SULLIVAN Boys like him have -- expectations.
JAMIE I have expectations, too.
Pause.
He's feeling her grow up, grow away.
REV. SULLIVAN I'm not changing the rules.
JAMIE I haven't asked you to.
They eye each other.
He's losing her.
A nurse points Landon toward a patient room.
He carries a battered liquor-store box.
A TV flickers.
Landon comes in.
Opens the box.
Pulls out the evergreen wreath with the plaid bow.
LANDON For me.
LANDON Christmas is all about the smells.
Landon leans the wreath in the window.
HAROLD KEENE -- the old man from the accident, watches from his bed, baffled.
LANDON Pine's my favorite.
LANDON That and cider with cloves.
Landon pulls a Thermos from his coat pocket.
Unscrews the cap.
Finds a drinking cup.
Pours in cider.
Offers Harold the cup.
HAROLD Who are you?
LANDON Landon Carter.
LANDON I was driving the car that --
HAROLD You.
LANDON Me.
Harold takes the cup, looks Landon over.
Landon appears genuinely contrite.
LANDON I'm very sorry --
HAROLD What kind of a man are you, son?
Pause.
LANDON I don't know that I am -- a man.
LANDON Yet.
LANDON I'm working on it.
Pause.
HAROLD I've worked on it my whole life.
Harold reaches under his pillow.
Pulls out a small bottle of liquor.
Tops off his cider.
HAROLD Get yourself a glass.
LANDON No.
LANDON Thanks.
LANDON Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
Harold nods, liking Landon.
HAROLD You'll sit a while.
LANDON I will.
Landon speeds, the windows open, WIND WHIPPING, DIRE STRAITS BLASTING.
The Camaro turns and brakes and turns again, kicking up gravel, raising hell.
The car slides to a stop.
Landon turns OFF the RADIO.
Sits still.
Wipes the rearview mirror clean, spotless.
Unties the dangling plastic skeleton and pockets it.
Colorful banners and flags flap in the brisk WIND.
Landon talks with a used car SALESMAN.
SALESMAN Eight hundred.
LANDON It's got a new V-6 and transmission.
LANDON Alloy wheels.
LANDON Twelve hundred.
SALESMAN Nine-fifty.
LANDON New paint.
LANDON Extra chrome.
LANDON Not a scratch anywhere.
SALESMAN The interior is --
LANDON Reconditioned.
LANDON Completely.
LANDON Be a collector's someday.
LANDON Twelve hundred.
They look at the Camaro.
Shining in the sun.
SALESMAN You can't expect me to pay you for your -- attachment to that car.
Landon gazes at another dealership across the street, then adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old.
LANDON I don't.
LANDON I expect you to pay me for yours.
The Salesman looks from Landon to the car.
He pulls a wad of cash from his pocket.
Wearily counts out twelve bills.
Landon takes the money, touches the Camaro's hood, then walks away.
The marquee reads, "HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"
One car.
An old station wagon.
At the parking space, a sign: "School Principal Only."
Kelly looks up from paperwork.
MR. KELLY Landon?
Landon drops a folded wad of hundreds on the desk.
LANDON For Jefferson High.
LANDON For books.
MR. KELLY Where did you get -- ?
LANDON It's mine to give.
LANDON I didn't steal it.
MR. KELLY I didn't say you did.
But his tone implied it and Landon's already gone.
Kelly is immediately sorry.
He goes to his window and sees Landon pedal away on the old bike.
Landon watches a tow truck lower the abandoned Yugo.
When the car is down, he sees Jamie standing on the sidewalk.
Landon faces Jamie.
LANDON Hey.
JAMIE I heard what you did.
JAMIE Thank you.
He nods, but quickly changes the subject.
LANDON She great or what?
JAMIE Why are you doing all this?
JAMIE To impress me?
LANDON No.
LANDON But are you -- impressed?
She smiles.
JAMIE Like fire.
LANDON What?
JAMIE You.
She heads for her father's old Pontiac.
LANDON New Year's Eve.
LANDON Would you go out with me?!
She stops.
Turns around.
Surprised.
JAMIE Yes.
JAMIE But not as a date date.
LANDON Why not?
JAMIE I'm not allowed to date.
She smiles and gets in the car.
Landon follows signs for the church office.
Landon looks into the Reverend's office.
Reverend Sullivan is sitting behind his desk, examining legal-looking documents and records.
He takes his glasses off, rubs his eyes.
Landon knocks.
The Reverend looks up, furrows his brow.
LANDON Reverend Sullivan.
LANDON Can I ask you something?
REV. SULLIVAN Does it have to do with Jamie?
LANDON Yes, sir.
The Reverend makes a small motion and Landon enters.
Landon doesn't sit.
LANDON I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
REV. SULLIVAN That won't be possible.
He looks back to his papers.
End of conversation.
LANDON I'm sorry I haven't always treated Jamie the way -- I should have.
LANDON She deserves better.
Reverend Sullivan glances up.
As if surprised Landon is still there.
LANDON I care for her.
REV. SULLIVAN I don't want to see her hurt.
LANDON I wouldn't do that --
REV. SULLIVAN This week.
LANDON Ever again.
The Reverend looks out the window.
A gray day, cold, bitter, stark.
He considers his options.
REV. SULLIVAN Have her home by one.
REV. SULLIVAN And drive carefully.
Landon's under the Yugo's hood.
Josh, the kid from next door, is in the driver's seat.
LANDON Start the engine.
Josh turns the key.
Nothing happens.
Under the hood, Landon changes something.
LANDON Again.
Josh tries the engine again.
Still no go.
Landon changes something else.
LANDON One more time.
Josh tries one more time.
The ENGINE ROARS, then DIES, then amazingly STARTS again.
It's running.
Landon high- fives Josh, then sees an old station wagon turn in.
Kelly hands a paper to Landon.
MR. KELLY Your grades for fall semester.
MR. KELLY They're -- good.
LANDON You came here to give me my report card?
MR. KELLY I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
Landon understands what Kelly is implying.
MR. KELLY I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
LANDON Thank you.
MR. KELLY You're welcome.
They shake hands.
Landon, dressed with care, faces the mirror and wet combs his hair.
A seafood joint on the waterfront.
Quaint, not fancy.
Twinkle lights illuminate Jamie's face.
Landon finds her lovely.
Jamie picks.
JAMIE I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
LANDON I wanted this to be a date.
She watches Landon, happy, then perplexed.
Landon wolfing down his food.
JAMIE Is there a rush?
LANDON I have to get you home by one.
JAMIE It's only 7:30.
LANDON We're going somewhere.
LANDON After.
LANDON And no.
LANDON I didn't ask your father.
Landon drives.
The CARS' "Tonight She Comes" PLAYS.
He belches loudly, dramatically.
JAMIE Excuse you.
LANDON Your turn.
JAMIE No.
LANDON I know you want to.
She grins.
And tries.
A small burp.
LANDON Bring the air all the way up from your stomach.
He belches again.
Just as loud.
She tries again, laughing.
Landon steers the car into a parking lot for a miniature golf course with a castle-shaped video arcade and Little League diamond.
A family entertainment center.
Jamie sees where they are.
LANDON Before we do this.
JAMIE We're doing something -- ?
LANDON Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
She waits for more.
LANDON It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
JAMIE What are you talking about?
LANDON That little bit of larceny in your heart.
JAMIE Excuse me?
LANDON Fun.
Jamie's in the cage with a helmet on.
A machine tosses balls.
Landon coaches from outside.
LANDON Swing!
LANDON Keep your bat parallel to the ground.
LANDON Follow through.
LANDON Follow through!
Jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything.
The balls keep coming.
She ducks out of the way and grasps the fence and leans in.
Landon leans in on his side.
They'd be embracing if the fence weren't there.
In the b.g., kids from their school.
Giggling, whispering.
Landon looks over at them.
LANDON Let's go.
The YUGO ROARS down the asphalt.
A sign for the approaching state line whips by.
Jamie and Landon.
With STEVIE NICKS' "Talk to Me" ON the
LANDON The cells in our bodies are always changing.
LANDON In six or seven years all your cells have changed.
LANDON You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
JAMIE That what's happening to you, only faster?
He grins.
Pulls the car over.
LANDON Get out.
LANDON Come on.
He leaps out, leaving the headlights on.
Landon takes Jamie's hand and pulls her toward some invisible place.
JAMIE Where -- what -- are we -- ?
He keeps tugging her.
She follows him.
Laughing.
LANDON Stand right here.
JAMIE Where?
He leans down and lifts one of her feet a foot from the other.
He notices a large bruise on her leg.
She brushes her dress down.
JAMIE You're acting like a crazy person.
LANDON You're straddling the state line.
LANDON You're in two places at once.
She's thrilled at his solution to her wish.
He walks to the shoulder of the road.
LANDON Repeat after me.
Huh?
He does a cartwheel.
She laughs.
JAMIE I can't.
LANDON I'm gonna teach you.
A starry night with a bright moon.
Glimmering silver water.
Jamie and Landon walk onto a dock.
DISTANT
JAMIE It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
LANDON You're sometimes not sure?
JAMIE I'm sure.
JAMIE Pretty sure.
They reach the end of the dock.
She turns to face the WIND.
It blows her hair.
She turns his face the same way.
JAMIE It's like the wind.
JAMIE I can't see it but I feel it.
He closes his eyes.
Feeling the wind.
Opens them again, rejecting the idea.
LANDON We can measure wind.
JAMIE Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
LANDON What do you actually know with religion?
JAMIE Wonder.
JAMIE Beauty.
JAMIE Joy.
JAMIE Love.
She's embarrassed.
She tries to avoid implying anything.
JAMIE My mother told me God is love, so when you're feeling love, you're feeling God.
JAMIE I think talking about these things -- threatens their very beauty and mystery.
Her tone is matter-of-fact, but Landon's got a serious and tender look on his face.
He touches her hair.
JAMIE I don't understand...
LANDON Maybe you're not supposed to.
He moves closer.
LANDON I might kiss you.
She looks down.
Shy.
JAMIE I might do it wrong.
LANDON Not possible.
He touches her neck, her cheek, her mouth.
Then leans in and kisses her.
A tender, soft kiss.
He pulls away.
They look at each other a moment.
LANDON I love you, Jamie.
There, he put it out there, risked looking and feeling foolish.
Not the old Landon.
Jamie looks away.
Mixed emotions.
Happy and sad.
LANDON Now's when you say something.
JAMIE I can't.
JAMIE I can't -- explain.
She turns back to him, her eyes shining.
She touches his face and they kiss again, deeply.
But after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his shoulder.
Smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof, staring at the water.
He pulls away slightly to study her face.
He touches her cheek and brings her back from wherever she's been.
JAMIE You make me feel...
LANDON Loved?
JAMIE That.
JAMIE And less strange.
Tears run down her cheeks.
Landon wipes them away with his thumbs, attributing them to happiness.
Landon follows Jamie up the steps.
The lights in the living room are on.
THROUGH the windows, they can see her father taking down the Christmas tree.
JAMIE Be very quiet.
He pulls her to him.
Kisses her.
The front door opens.
REV. SULLIVAN Hello, Landon.
Landon and Jamie separate, but Landon keeps an arm over her shoulder.
LANDON Hey, Reverend.
Reverend Sullivan studies the two young people.
LANDON Happy New Year.
And he goes.
Jamie walks by her father and into the house.
Not saying anything.
He watches her.
What has he allowed?
Landon and Jamie head into school.
Landon nods to Belinda, others.
They glare back.
LANDON What's your damage?
Landon and Jamie arrive at his locker.
It's been kicked in.
LANDON Assholes.
LANDON This happen to you?
JAMIE Twice a year.
Bang, bang, bang.
Landon kicks in every locker in his row.
A dozen in all.
Jamie watches, a little frightened by his anger.
But then he turns to her and grins.
LANDON Now they all match.
Landon eats alone, ignored by Eric and Clay.
Jamie approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful.
She hesitates about sitting -- feeling bad that Landon's being diminished, ostracized.
She thinks he doesn't see her.
But as she turns to leave, he pulls a chair out for her and smiles.
She sits.
Landon sees her face.
LANDON What's wr--?
JAMIE The Challenger exploded.
JAMIE Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM CRACKLES.
Landon takes Jamie's hand as the room hushes.
LANDON Come on.
JAMIE Where?
LANDON Away from here.
Landon leads Jamie up, round and round, to the top of the tall steel tower.
They exit the staircase to a small 360 degree overlook.
Jamie's amazed at the view.
JAMIE How do you know this place?
LANDON Before the divorce.
LANDON My father used to take me here.
LANDON Fire spotting was his summer job.
They look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets sky.
LANDON From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.
LANDON On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
JAMIE What would you do up here?
LANDON Look.
LANDON Talk.
LANDON Not talk.
He pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket.
They sit and he starts to shuffle.
Not too well.
Jamie takes the deck.
Shuffles like a card shark.
Jamie is already waiting when Landon's Yugo pulls up.
He gets out, walks to her, they kiss.
LANDON What'd you tell your father?
JAMIE The truth.
JAMIE I just left you out of it.
She climbs up and over the wall.
He follows.
Jamie fits the pieces of her telescope together.
LANDON When did you build this?
JAMIE I was twelve.
Landon shakes his head, amazed.
JAMIE It's not that complicated.
Landon doubts this.
JAMIE It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
LANDON Where's the one you're building?
JAMIE In my back yard.
JAMIE I lied before.
JAMIE It's hardly started.
JAMIE But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
LANDON Wait, back up.
LANDON You lied?
JAMIE Kinda.
JAMIE Yeah.
He grins, loving her even more.
JAMIE So what do you want to see?
LANDON Mars.
JAMIE Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
He opens his backpack.
Pulls out the contents.
LANDON A Thermos of hot coffee.
LANDON A blanket.
LANDON Socks.
JAMIE You planned this --
LANDON Hoped for it.
Pause.
JAMIE Are you trying to seduce me?
LANDON No.
LANDON Why?
LANDON Are you seducible?
JAMIE No.
LANDON That's what I thought.
He reaches back into his backpack.
Pulls out a second blanket.
LANDON Ergo, a second blanket.
LANDON One for me, one for you.
He hands her one.
She takes it, smiling, reassured.
JAMIE Ergo?
LANDON What about your father?
JAMIE I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed.
His feet find slippers on the floor.
Reverend Sullivan, wearing a robe, enters quietly.
Checking on his daughter.
Her bed is empty.
The old Pontiac slows.
Reverend Sullivan looks down the access road to the rear cemetery gate.
The Yugo parked by the gate.
The Reverend struggles with what to do.
After a moment, he decides not to interfere; he'll pick his moment.
He keeps driving.
Jamie and Landon are looking at the heavens through the telescope.
LANDON Where's Pluto?
JAMIE In Virgo, but it's about 1000 times too faint to see.
LANDON What's the best thing I can see tonight?
JAMIE Me.
He draws her close, they kiss.
She shyly pulls away.
Their hands still touching until she looks again into the telescope eyepiece.
JAMIE The second best thing is Jupiter.
She swivels the telescope into position for Jupiter and steps aside so he can look.
But he picks up the flashlight, pulls a diagram from his pocket.
LANDON Can you locate XXI5639I?
JAMIE Sure.
She takes the diagram, studies it, and adjusts the scope.
JAMIE Here.
JAMIE Why am I looking at this star?
LANDON Because I had it named for you.
LANDON I know it's not an official designation --
She couldn't be happier.
She reaches for his hand.
JAMIE It's wonderful.
JAMIE I love you.
It's the first time he's heard it.
He pulls her into his arms.
They kiss.
Passionately.
She starts to object.
LANDON Okay.
LANDON I'm stopping.
And he does.
They snuggle.
Silence, then:
LANDON What's number one?
Long pause.
JAMIE In April when the dogwoods and wisteria are blooming...
JAMIE Get married.
He doesn't make fun.
He strokes her hair.
Kisses her forehead.
Landon enters from outside.
Cynthia, still in her waitress uniform, is sitting at the table, drinking coffee.
CYNTHIA A late night or an early morning?
LANDON Late night.
LANDON You?
CYNTHIA Were you with Jamie?
LANDON Yeah.
CYNTHIA You sleeping with her?
Landon doesn't dignify this question with an answer.
CYNTHIA I was cleaning yesterday.
CYNTHIA I found this.
She pulls Landon's Life List from her pocket.
Landon is horrified.
She reads it.
CYNTHIA Scuba dive.
CYNTHIA Touch a moon rock.
CYNTHIA Learn to read Egyptian hieroglyphs.
CYNTHIA Go to college?
CYNTHIA She talking to you 'bout this stuff?
Landon doesn't answer.
She puts the list on the table.
Smoothes it.
Gently discouraging.
CYNTHIA Honey, some of this is...
CYNTHIA farfetched.
CYNTHIA You take after me.
CYNTHIA People skills and common sense.
CYNTHIA Good dependable qualities.
LANDON I could take after Dad, too.
CYNTHIA You do.
CYNTHIA You're handsome and charming.
LANDON I meant he's a doctor.
CYNTHIA That's eight years of school and training -- after college.
CYNTHIA And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
LANDON I could do it if I tried.
LANDON Even Kelly thinks so.
CYNTHIA That'd be something.
She doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to be practical and realistic.
CYNTHIA But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach.
CYNTHIA Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
LANDON Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
CYNTHIA Disappointment isn't something anyone plans for.
CYNTHIA It catches you by surprise.
Long pause.
They are both sorry to have raised their voices.
CYNTHIA Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
LANDON Mom, great.
LANDON But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
Landon eats dinner with Jamie and Reverend Sullivan.
Silence, then:
REV. SULLIVAN Landon.
REV. SULLIVAN You're not the quiet type.
LANDON No.
REV. SULLIVAN So talk to us about something.
LANDON Like what, sir?
REV. SULLIVAN You decide.
Landon searches his mind for just the right subject.
REV. SULLIVAN How about your family?
LANDON Okay.
LANDON Sure.
LANDON My grandfather.
LANDON When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.
LANDON Made a big impression on him.
Reverend Sullivan looks at his daughter.
She's nodding, interested.
LANDON My cousin Mike.
LANDON He's from a big family.
LANDON He's the fifth kid.
LANDON He heard that every fifth child in the world is Chinese.
LANDON So he thought he was.
Jamie smiles.
LANDON We didn't tell him any different for years --
REV. SULLIVAN Your parents are divorced?
LANDON Since I was five.
LANDON My mom's a cocktail waitress.
REV. SULLIVAN How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
LANDON Materially or spiritually?
REV. SULLIVAN Either.
REV. SULLIVAN Both.
LANDON I don't know.
LANDON We used to try to believe in each other.
His eyes meet the Reverend's.
The Reverend's got to respect him some.
Reverend Sullivan looks out the window into the back yard.
Jamie showing Landon the junk pile that will become her newer, larger telescope.
They are laughing, jostling each other, comfortable, happy.
Reverend Sullivan and Jamie put the dishes away.
REV. SULLIVAN You and the Carter boy.
REV. SULLIVAN Want to catch me up on recent developments?
JAMIE You're asking if we're involved?
REV. SULLIVAN I'm asking how much.
JAMIE Dad --
REV. SULLIVAN It's time to tell him.
REV. SULLIVAN It would be the right thing.
She turns to him, upset.
Her anger spilling out.
JAMIE Maybe.
JAMIE But that's not the real reason.
JAMIE You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want!
JAMIE Me all to yourself!
REV. SULLIVAN No.
REV. SULLIVAN I want what's best for you.
JAMIE This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
REV. SULLIVAN You're sure?
REV. SULLIVAN You're sure you can trust him?
He's playing to her old insecurities.
She's not one hundred percent sure.
REV. SULLIVAN Isn't it better to know?
Their eyes meet.
She knows he's right.
Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Three Amigos!
on the marquee.
Landon and Jamie exit as Belinda and a new boyfriend buy tickets.
Clay and Eric and a crowd behind them.
LANDON Hey, Belinda.
She takes her boyfriend's arm, turns away, snubbing him.
LANDON Clay, Eric.
Eric says something inaudible and the whole crowd sniggers and laughs.
He's become Landon.
Landon reddens, now realizing for certain that he's become a Jamie Sullivan.
Landon and Jamie walk.
The theater in the b.g.
JAMIE From citizen high to citizen low.
LANDON I don't care.
JAMIE Care, but just don't let it get to you.
JAMIE It gives them power.
LANDON That what you do?
JAMIE Yes.
JAMIE I try to keep my power.
He's impressed with how she manages.
LANDON One of your secrets.
JAMIE Yes, one of many.
He doesn't notice her tone.
WHITNEY HOUSTON's "How Will I Know?" ON the RADIO.
Jamie flips the RADIO OFF.
She's got something on her mind.
Landon notices only that she seems a bit remote.
LANDON You're worried about your college applications.
JAMIE I'm not applying to college.
LANDON But you said --
JAMIE No, you assumed.
He looks at her, questioning.
She's looking out her window.
LANDON You're going to take a year off?
LANDON Join the Peace Corps -- ?
JAMIE No.
LANDON What are you going to -- ?
JAMIE Pull over.
LANDON Where?
LANDON Why?
JAMIE Pull over.
JAMIE Now.
JAMIE Please.
Tears are running down her face.
He pulls the car over.
Jamie gets out of the car.
Landon quickly follows.
LANDON Jamie --
JAMIE I'm sick.
LANDON Then I'll take you home.
LANDON You'll feel better tomorrow.
He tries to take her arm.
She shakes off his hand, steps back.
Wanting to be heard and understood.
JAMIE Landon.
JAMIE I'm sick -- with leukemia.
Landon tries to say something.
Nothing comes out.
His soul numb.
JAMIE I found out last winter.
JAMIE I'm not responding to treatment anymore.
His face crumples with pain and anguish.
LANDON Why didn't you tell me?
JAMIE The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.
JAMIE I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
LANDON Including me?!
JAMIE Especially you.
JAMIE God gives me an illness, then you.
JAMIE A cruel joke.
She gets in the car.
Slams her door shut.
He stands there, not knowing what to do.
Landon pulls up in front of Jamie's house.
A long quiet ride.
LANDON I'm not letting you die.
Jamie just looks at him.
Feeling sorry for him -- what he wants doesn't matter.
The Reverend and Landon drink coffee.
REV. SULLIVAN It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
LANDON How -- how long does she have?
REV. SULLIVAN Two, three months.
REV. SULLIVAN Maybe less.
REV. SULLIVAN Maybe more.
LANDON So you've given up.
Reverend Sullivan hears the challenge in his voice.
REV. SULLIVAN Her doctors have.
REV. SULLIVAN Jamie and I.
REV. SULLIVAN We're still praying for a miracle.
LANDON Praying.
REV. SULLIVAN Landon.
REV. SULLIVAN We've lived with this for over a year now and --
LANDON If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
It's a long answer and by the time the Reverend opens his mouth to explain, Landon's out the door.
Moonless dark.
Few cars.
The YUGO RIPS down the road.
Landon opens a map over the steering wheel.
Turns on the dome light.
Looks at the return address on an old letter.
Landon's Yugo winds through city streets.
Mansions.
Big lawns.
The Yugo slows as Landon leans forward to read a street sign.
His face is tear-streaked.
He flicks his headlights to bright, then low again.
The car turns left.
Large new colonial.
Landon slams his car door and stands in the street.
Staring at his father's house.
He heads up a flagstone path for the front door.
Landon RINGS the resounding DING-DONG BELL, then bangs on the heavy wood door.
Grief-stricken.
LANDON Dr. Carter!...
LANDON Carter!...
LANDON Dad!
LANDON Please!!
LANDON I have to talk to you!!
Elegant, thick carpets.
Dr. Carter, putting on his robe, parts the silk drapes in the upstairs hall.
His son standing on the front lawn.
Distraught, tearful.
LANDON Open the door!
LANDON Please!!
Landon backs away from the house.
Angrily kicks over a decorative planter.
Is halfway to his car when Dr. Carter opens the door and comes out.
DR. CARTER Landon!
Landon doesn't hear.
DR. CARTER Landon!!
Landon turns around.
Sees his father.
Breaks down, sobbing.
His father goes to him.
Hugs him, a big bear hug.
LANDON You have to save her!
DR. CARTER Landon, who?
DR. CARTER Is your mother all right?
Lights pop upstairs.
LANDON It's Jamie -- my girlfriend -- she has cancer -- you have to come look at her -- right now!
DR. CARTER It's the middle of the night --
LANDON I don't give a shit what time it is!
Landon pulls away.
Angrier.
DR. CARTER Landon, I'm a cardiologist, not an oncologist --
LANDON You're a doctor, aren't you?!!
He waves his father off, dismissing him.
DR. CARTER Landon!
DR. CARTER I'll look into it!!
But Landon hasn't heard.
He's in his car.
Dr. Carter watches his son's car move away, regretful.
Landon quietly shuts the back door.
Exhausted.
Starts making coffee.
Cynthia appears.
CYNTHIA Your father called.
No response.
CYNTHIA Jamie's a patient at his hospital.
CYNTHIA He's having a colleague look at her chart this morning.
Long pause.
CYNTHIA I'm sorry.
CYNTHIA I didn't know.
LANDON I didn't know either.
The Yugo parked in the driveway.
The morning paper lying on the grass.
Landon paces in front of the front porch.
Incapable of ringing the bell, lacking the courage, lacking the right words.
Upstairs, the curtains move.
Jamie looks out the window.
Landon pacing, talking to himself.
She starts to raise the window, to say something, to help him, but then lets the curtain drop.
She needs for him to decide, for him to be ready to face this with her.
The sound of a CAR.
She looks out the window again.
The Yugo driving away.
Landon lies on his bed in the dark.
The PHONE RINGS.
Landon stares at his extension.
The RINGING STOPS.
A voice from downstairs.
CYNTHIA It's your father.
Landon picks up his phone.
The door to Landon's room is ajar.
Cynthia waits outside.
Listening.
Hearing nothing.
She pushes the door open.
Landon sitting on his bed.
Deflated.
LANDON He can't do anything.
Cynthia is pained to see his suffering.
CYNTHIA If it's incurable --
LANDON I told him to leave me alone.
CYNTHIA Landon --
LANDON It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
Landon's still in bed.
Facing the wall.
Cynthia KNOCKS.
Enters with a plate of food.
CYNTHIA I brought some dinner.
No response.
She leaves the tray and goes.
Jamie and her father eat dinner.
Jamie is red-eyed, heartbroken.
JAMIE He'll call.
REV. SULLIVAN I wanted to think he'd changed.
JAMIE No you didn't.
JAMIE But he did change.
JAMIE Just not enough.
REV. SULLIVAN Jamie, you're not mad at me.
REV. SULLIVAN You're mad at Landon --
JAMIE I am mad at you!
JAMIE And at Landon!
JAMIE And the universe!
JAMIE And God!
JAMIE I don't even know where to put all my anger.
REV. SULLIVAN That's normal.
REV. SULLIVAN God accepts your anger.
REV. SULLIVAN He won't punish you.
JAMIE By making me ill, he is punishing me!
JAMIE I just don't know what for.
She flees the room.
Goes up the stairs.
Keeps going.
Up another flight to the attic.
Jamie opens a closet door.
Pulls out a dress, a scarf, jewelry, a worn book -- her mother's belongings.
She opens the book and starts to weep.
Missing her mother.
Reverend Sullivan stands, looking up at the attic stairs.
Frustrated, angry, worried.
Landon is still in bed.
Cynthia enters.
Pulls back the curtains.
Yanks up the shades.
CYNTHIA I don't care if you don't leave the house.
CYNTHIA But you have to get out of bed.
Landon sits at the kitchen table.
Cynthia pours him a cup of coffee.
CYNTHIA You and I may not be communicating very well right now.
CYNTHIA But let me be clear.
CYNTHIA Don't make this about you.
CYNTHIA It's about her.
Pause.
Her words sink in.
LANDON I have no idea what to say.
LANDON How to act.
LANDON What if I do the wrong thing?
CYNTHIA Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.
CYNTHIA Let Jamie take the lead.
CYNTHIA She'll let you know what she needs.
Before Landon can ring the bell, the front door opens.
The Reverend.
Landon runs past him into the house.
LANDON Where's Jamie?!
REV. SULLIVAN At school.
REV. SULLIVAN Where you should be.
Oh.
Deserted, classes are meeting.
Landon runs, sliding to a stop at one classroom door.
Looks in, keeps going, stops at another.
Searching.
This is JAMIE'S POV from the top of the hallway.
She stands, holding her books, watching him, unsure.
LANDON finally feels her gaze, turns to look.
JAMIE turns away, still angry and disappointed.
LANDON runs to her.
LANDON Jamie!
He catches up to her.
JAMIE AND LANDON face each other.
Neither sure what to say.
LANDON I'm so sorry.
LANDON I'm a coward --
JAMIE I should have told you sooner --
LANDON I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
JAMIE No.
JAMIE The drugs just stopped working.
JAMIE If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
Pause.
LANDON Are you frightened?
JAMIE All the time.
JAMIE I feel like I have no one.
She means not even God and he gets this.
LANDON You have me.
He hugs her close, rocking her, comforting her and himself.
JAMIE Help me live until I die?
LANDON I will.
A small group of students sit on stage reading from Our Town, rehearsing.
Jamie and Landon sit together in the third row, holding hands.
Landon glances at her, realizes she's asleep.
Pulls her sweater over her.
Landon sits with Luis; Jamie at the next table with Isabel.
She looks pale.
He catches her eye.
They both smile, a little sadly, then turn back to their students.
Landon drives them home from Jefferson High.
No music.
LANDON They're going to build a tunnel under the English Channel.
LANDON They're calling it The Chunnel.
No response.
LANDON You hungry?
JAMIE Nope.
LANDON Anything you want.
JAMIE Nothing.
He reaches into a cooler on the floor of the back seat.
LANDON Slim Jim?
LANDON Apple?
LANDON Yogurt?
LANDON You like yogurt.
JAMIE I used to like yogurt.
He places a red heart-shaped box in her lap.
LANDON Not very original.
LANDON Happy Valentine's Day.
He grins.
She looks crestfallen, feels terrible.
JAMIE I didn't even think about it.
He takes a chocolate.
Pops it in his mouth.
Grins.
LANDON There.
LANDON You gave me a chocolate.
PULL BACK to reveal...
Jamie and Landon are looking at stars.
A long quiet moment.
LANDON What are you thinking?
JAMIE That I want you to take me home.
LANDON Now?
LANDON We just --
JAMIE I don't want to come here anymore.
She begins taking the telescope apart.
Depressed.
Jamie looks at the high fence, weary, then reaches into a pocket for a key.
Unlocks the gate.
Swings the gate open.
Landon's astonished.
LANDON You have a key?
JAMIE Yeah.
JAMIE I've just never needed it.
JAMIE Will you talk to my father?
LANDON I've talked to your father.
JAMIE That's what I mean.
Their eyes meet.
Her look is serious.
Reverend Sullivan is up a ladder.
Cleaning a gutter.
Landon stands below, a few feet away, gathering his nerve.
He walks over.
The Reverend is busy ignoring Landon standing below.
A long beat, then:
LANDON Sir.
LANDON Being ignored is beginning to feel preferable to being noticed.
The Reverend looks down.
LANDON I'll be honest.
LANDON I don't know if I can pray, but I can do just about anything else.
Neither Landon nor the Reverend see Jamie come out of the house and walk over.
Landon shields his eyes with a hand to see the Reverend better.
LANDON Whatever you need.
LANDON Whatever Jamie needs.
LANDON I'm here.
LANDON I could start by driving her to school --
JAMIE I'm not going back to school.
Landon and her father both turn to her.
Pale, wane.
They understand what she is saying.
JAMIE You can tell anyone you want.
JAMIE I don't care.
She goes into the house.
Landon and Reverend Sullivan look at each other, then away, uncomfortable.
That didn't sound like her.
Landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out Jamie's locker.
Students stare as he carefully places her things, including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag.
They part and hush as he passes by.
News travels fast.
Clay and Eric step forward.
CLAY Hey.
CLAY Landon.
ERIC We heard 'bout Jamie Sullivan.
ERIC She --
LANDON Say nothing.
LANDON Nothing 'bout her.
ERIC No.
ERIC Hey.
ERIC We're sorry, man!
Landon turns back.
Surprised.
Inspects Belinda.
Eric.
Clay.
Others.
No one speaks.
LANDON Too late and not enough.
He pushes past Belinda's new boyfriend, heading for the office.
Mr. Kelly and Landon.
LANDON I know it means not graduating, but I need to be excused from all school acti--
MR. KELLY You're excused.
Landon heads for the door.
MR. KELLY How is she?
Landon can't answer.
Too emotional.
MR. KELLY You will graduate.
Landon looks up, astounded.
MR. KELLY If I have to tutor you myself.
Landon nods, accepting, appreciative.
Landon puts away the contents of the shopping bag.
Jamie's in bed, wearing the sweater.
JAMIE Yesterday I felt sick, horrible.
JAMIE Today I feel like riding my bike.
JAMIE Or dancing.
He turns on the CLOCK RADIO next to her bed.
Finds a WALTZ.
Offers his hand.
Pulls her out of bed.
She's in pajamas.
JAMIE You know how to waltz??
LANDON I was going to fake it.
JAMIE I always fake it.
So they waltz, faking, stumbling and laughing, holding each other.
Reverend Sullivan hears the MUSIC and LAUGHTER.
He frowns, afraid for Jamie's health.
Jamie grips Landon's arms, seems to slip, suddenly too exhausted to carry her weight.
Landon picks her up, gently carries her back to bed.
Settles her in.
LANDON How you doing?
JAMIE Tired.
Landon sits on her bed.
Strokes her hair.
They look at each other.
Landon reaches for her hand.
When he looks at her face again, she's asleep.
Landon's sitting on his childhood tree swing, twisting side to side.
Pensive.
His mother comes out of the house.
LANDON Time seems to be slowing down and speeding up at the same time.
She reaches to put a hand on his shoulder.
He lets her.
The rear gate is open.
A caretaker waits while Landon carries pieces of the older telescope to his car.
A tall pile of parts is already at his car.
Eric and Clay drive up in Eric's pickup.
Gravel flying.
Eric and Clay spy Landon.
Landon freezes, not sure what to expect.
The truck makes a circle around Landon, then stops.
The MUSIC QUIETS.
Eric and Clay jump down.
A long tense moment, then:
ERIC Hey.
LANDON Hey.
Without a word, Clay walks to the Yugo, lifts the heaviest telescope part, and carries it to the bed of the pickup.
Eric follows suit.
Landon studies the pieces of the smaller telescope and how they fit together.
They are like a map for how to build the bigger one.
Landon unloads an impossibly large round cardboard concrete form-tube from his car.
Carries it around the house toward the back yard.
Jamie wakes from a nap.
She looks thinner, grayer.
She hears HAMMERING.
She hauls herself up and to a window.
Landon working on the new telescope.
He looks up at her window.
Sees her there.
Smiles.
Reverend Sullivan comes in to check on Jamie.
She's standing at the window.
REV. SULLIVAN What's that boy doing?
She turns to look at him and collapses into his arms.
Jamie lies in bed, eyes closed.
Hooked to monitors, pumps, an IV drip.
Landon holding her hand.
Reverend Sullivan talks quietly with a doctor.
Hearing bad news.
The sky is pink.
A squirrel runs along a telephone wire.
The Yugo is the only car in the visitor lot.
Landon, in yesterday's clothes, dozes lightly.
Jamie moves and he starts, fully awake.
She opens her eyes.
LANDON You okay?
She nods.
Sleepy.
Closes her eyes again.
He rests his head on her shoulder and weeps.
Her eyes open, then close again.
There's nothing to say.
Reverend Sullivan looks through the window in the door at the scene within.
He hesitates, then pushes the door open.
Reverend Sullivan enters.
REV. SULLIVAN Landon.
REV. SULLIVAN You go on home.
LANDON I'm not tired.
REV. SULLIVAN I need to be with her.
There's only one chair.
Landon nods and goes.
The Reverend sits, closes his eyes a moment.
When he opens them, she's looking at him.
JAMIE Dad.
He kisses her forehead, then sits back.
JAMIE So serious.
REV. SULLIVAN Jamie, God is not punishing you.
REV. SULLIVAN No God I know wants anyone to be sick or feel pain or suffer.
Pause.
JAMIE When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
REV. SULLIVAN I was wrong.
REV. SULLIVAN Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did.
REV. SULLIVAN Not even God.
He lets this sink in.
REV. SULLIVAN God loaned you to me, entrusted you to my care.
REV. SULLIVAN I'm failing you.
She looks away, agreeing without saying so.
REV. SULLIVAN Jamie.
REV. SULLIVAN I make you the same promise that God does.
REV. SULLIVAN I will always be with you.
She sits up and embraces him.
He wraps his arms around her.
Tight.
She closes her eyes, tears welling, never wanting to let him go.
Her father.
On the marquee on the front lawn: "WELCOME HALEY'S COMET."
The Yugo parks in the b.g.
Landon picks up a pile of books and assignments.
Looks through them, then eyes Miss Tarbox.
LANDON Where's Jamie's book?!
MISS TARBOX That's everything Mr. Kelly gave me.
LANDON The next book on that list!
LANDON The Old Man and...
LANDON and...
MISS TARBOX The Sea.
LANDON Yeah.
LANDON I need it today!
Mr. Kelly steps out of his inner office.
Sees Landon's anguished face, his exhaustion.
MR. KELLY I'll drive a copy over to her.
Landon nods his appreciation.
Jamie looks smaller.
Her eyes have blue circles beneath.
The Hemingway novel on the bedstand.
Belinda pushes the door open.
Peeks in.
Not sure she is welcome.
Landon is sitting in a chair.
He sees her, motions for her to come in.
Quietly.
BELINDA She asleep?
LANDON I'll tell her you were here.
Pause.
Awkwardness.
BELINDA Give her this, okay?
She hands Landon a small photo album.
BELINDA Pictures from the play.
BELINDA Jamie looks pretty --
LANDON I'm sorry about how we --
BELINDA No.
BELINDA You're with who you should be.
BELINDA It's like she chose you.
LANDON And I have no idea why.
BELINDA I do.
She hugs him quickly, then leaves.
Landon goes to the window, looks out.
The sky is grayer, darker.
Landon is still at the window.
Jamie wakes.
JAMIE Hi.
He goes to her side.
LANDON Hey.
He kisses her.
JAMIE I have something for you.
She reaches under her pillow for the worn book from the attic.
She offers it to Landon.
JAMIE Don't worry.
JAMIE It's not a Bible.
He takes it.
JAMIE My mother made it for me before I was born.
JAMIE It's got quotes from famous people.
JAMIE Her favorite lines from books.
JAMIE Her thoughts.
Landon looks at a page.
LANDON 'What is a friend?
LANDON A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
JAMIE Lower.
JAMIE Same page.
LANDON 'Find out who you are and do it on purpose.' Dolly Parton.
A bookmark falls out.
He studies that page a moment.
CLOSE ON PASSAGE from Corinthians.
Landon reads it.
LANDON 'Love is always patient and kind.
LANDON It is never boastful or conceited -- '
JAMIE That was read at my parents' wedding.
He takes her hand.
Holds it.
LANDON How're you doing?
JAMIE Better.
JAMIE I was really angry.
LANDON I know.
JAMIE It's gone now.
LANDON Because you have hope that you'll get better?
JAMIE No.
JAMIE Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself.
JAMIE Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
He kneels on the floor.
Puts his head on her pillow next to hers.
JAMIE Maybe I believe God sent you to me because I am ill.
JAMIE To help me through.
He touches her face tenderly.
JAMIE I want to go home.
Pause.
He gets her meaning.
LANDON I'll talk to your father.
JAMIE It's not that simple.
JAMIE It costs money to do this at home.
Cynthia pacing, talking on the phone, worried.
The front door is wide open.
CYNTHIA ...
CYNTHIA He doesn't talk to me, maybe not to anyone, except Jamie...
She stands in the doorway and looks out.
Landon in his car in the driveway.
Landon just sits.
Exhausted, despondent.
Cynthia pacing.
CYNTHIA ...
CYNTHIA I've never asked you for extra.
CYNTHIA But we need it now...
CYNTHIA as soon as possible...
Jamie's breathing is shallower.
Landon's reading her The Sheltering Sky.
He pauses, looks up.
Isabel, Jamie's student, is standing in the doorway.
Jamie sees her too.
She smiles weakly.
JAMIE Isabel?
ISABEL Hi.
Isabel comes in.
Landon offers her the book.
She takes it and keeps going from where Landon left off.
Stumbling but reading.
Jamie grins.
JAMIE Who's been working with you?
Isabel looks shyly at Landon.
Jamie shakes her head, amazed.
Landon nods to Isabel and she begins reading again.
Landon quietly opens the back door to the kitchen.
Cynthia sits at the table with Dr. Carter, his father.
CYNTHIA Sit with us a minute.
Landon enters, but doesn't sit.
LANDON What are you doing here?
CYNTHIA He wants to talk to you.
LANDON Now it's okay?
CYNTHIA Landon.
CYNTHIA You have two parents.
CYNTHIA We're both here for you even --
DR. CARTER -- even if we're not here for each other anymore.
Landon is listening.
DR. CARTER I want to do this.
DR. CARTER Please let me.
He holds out a check.
For a lot of money.
Landon takes it.
Grateful.
LANDON Thank you.
A smaller Jamie lies in a hospital bed, seemingly asleep.
Hooked to an IV.
Bottles of pills.
Landon dozes in a comfortable chair.
A nurse sits in a corner, reading.
Eric and Clay stand in the doorway, not sure what to do.
Jamie opens her eyes, smiles.
JAMIE Don't wake Landon.
They tiptoe in.
Stand on either side of her bed.
JAMIE Do I look scary?
ERIC Not too bad.
CLAY You all right?
A dumb question but she handles it well.
JAMIE Things could be better.
Awkward pause.
CLAY We thought you'd be asleep --
JAMIE I don't know what to say either.
Clay hands her an envelope.
JAMIE What is it?
She pulls out a stack of worn bills.
CLAY For the book drive.
CLAY Landon told us about it --
ERIC We told everyone at school.
Jamie takes their hands, holds them.
Thanking them silently.
Her eyes shining with tears.
Landon sits at his desk, sketching the larger telescope, making a few computations.
A library book on Haley's Comet is open.
A stack of similar books by his elbow.
Cynthia enters wearing her waitressing outfit.
CYNTHIA What can I do?
He shrugs.
Tears fill his eyes.
LANDON Everything's being done but it's not enough.
LANDON I have to find something -- more.
CYNTHIA Landon, honey.
CYNTHIA There's nothing more.
LANDON I don't mean about Jamie being sick.
LANDON I mean about Jamie and me.
CYNTHIA Be with her when she wants.
CYNTHIA Make sure she never feels alone.
Landon thinks his mother is also talking about herself.
LANDON Mom, I'm not going anywhere.
LANDON Not yet anyway.
Pause.
CYNTHIA When you are ready, I want you to feel free to go.
They embrace.
Landon opens Jamie's mother's book.
A photo of Jamie falls out -- one taken by Belinda.
Jamie, beautiful, smiling at the audience.
LANDON considers the photo, finds a page to tuck it into.
"For Landon" above some underlined text, a Psalm from the Bible.
LANDON 'I cry to you my Lord, my rock!
LANDON Do not be deaf to me, for if you are silent, I shall go down to the pit like the rest.
LANDON Hear my voice raised in petition as I cry to you for help, as I raise my hands, my Lord, toward your holy of holies.'
Landon knows Jamie underlined this for him.
Landon tears down the steps.
Past his mother to the front door.
He's out the door before she even turns around.
Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed.
His feet find slippers on the floor.
He looks haggard, his hair thinner, his face defeated.
The Reverend, wearing his robe, checks on his sleeping daughter.
The night nurse nods as he tucks in blankets.
A SOUND.
Then another.
Reverend Sullivan goes to the window.
Parts the drapes.
Looks out.
A dozen flashlights in a big circle.
Landon in the middle, working feverishly on the new telescope.
The back porch light comes on.
Reverend Sullivan steps out onto the back porch.
Landon looks up.
LANDON I have to finish it tonight.
Without a word, the Reverend turns around and goes back inside.
Leaving the porch light on.
Landon goes back to work.
Reverend Sullivan comes out.
Dressed.
He carries two mugs of coffee and a brightly burning kerosene camp lantern.
Peace offerings.
He walks over, sets down the lantern, hands Landon a mug.
Ready to work.
LANDON I've almost finished the rocker.
LANDON Did she order mirrors?
REV. SULLIVAN In there.
As they walk to the garage.
REV. SULLIVAN You have materials for the side bearings?
LANDON I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
REV. SULLIVAN For the focuser?
LANDON A chrome-plated brass pipe from a drain line.
The Reverend nods, impressed.
He yanks the garage door up.
Goes in.
LANDON You know about this stuff?
REV. SULLIVAN I helped Jamie with the first one.
LANDON I thought she built it herself.
REV. SULLIVAN She did.
REV. SULLIVAN But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
The Reverend carries out a large cardboard postal package.
Landon takes it as the Reverend lowers the garage door.
LANDON I need to do this alone.
Reverend Sullivan searches Landon's face for a long moment, understanding, then turns and heads for the back door.
Landon stands in the doorway.
The Reverend is wiping his glasses, his face, maybe of tears.
He sees Landon.
REV. SULLIVAN You finish?
LANDON A few minutes ago.
LANDON I have to ask you something.
Long pause.
REV. SULLIVAN When I was seventeen, I was sent up for a year for stealing a car.
REV. SULLIVAN Sometimes I still feel that boy inside me and I don't like him.
REV. SULLIVAN But I like you.
The Reverend stands, offers Landon his hand.
Landon takes it.
The two men shake.
Allies now.
Jamie opens her eyes.
But can barely keep them open.
Groggy from pain medication.
Landon's standing there.
Showered, clean clothes.
LANDON We're going out.
He starts helping the nurse disconnect her IV.
JAMIE Can I -- go out?
LANDON You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Jamie looks at the nurse.
Uncertain.
The nurse nods.
Landon carries Jamie out a large attic window.
The finished large telescope is set up.
Pointing at the sky.
She's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket.
JAMIE It's beautiful...
JAMIE Thank you.
But she looks at the lights of the house and streets around them.
JAMIE I don't know what we'll be able to see...
JAMIE Help me stand.
He checks his watch.
LANDON Wait a sec.
As she turns to him, questioning, the neighborhood suddenly darkens as the street lamps and lights in every nearby house are switched off.
Neighbors step outside.
Hold up binoculars.
Members of the Star Club and other students look through traditional telescopes.
Jamie hugs Landon in gratitude.
LANDON We have five minutes.
Jamie, tears streaming, braces herself against Landon and she peers into the telescope eyepiece.
She pulls back, wipes her eyes, then looks again.
She swings the telescope into the correct position.
Haley's Comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and streamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's hazy head and long tail.
JAMIE The comet of the century...
She steps back so he can see.
He looks quickly, then moves aside so she can keep looking.
She's completely engrossed.
A long, quiet moment, then:
LANDON You love me?
She leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes.
LANDON Will you do something for me?
JAMIE Landon.
JAMIE I can't even do for myself.
LANDON But if you could, you would?
JAMIE Yes.
His throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear, sadness, and love.
LANDON Will you marry me?
Illness, happiness, disbelief.
A sea of pink, purple, and white blossoms.
Dogwoods, wisteria, azaleas, and roses blooming.
Bursting with everyone who knows Jamie and Landon -- every kid in their high school, including Eric, Clay, Belinda; teachers, including Ms. Garber; Mr. Kelly; Luis and Isabel and others from Jefferson High; her father's congregation; Cynthia Carter; Dr. Carter's new wife and their two kids; neighbors; hospital staff and home nurses.
Landon stands with his father by the altar.
The "WEDDING MARCH" begins...
The double doors at the back of the church open.
Everyone turns to look at the bride.
Gasps of joy and sadness.
Flanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan.
She's wearing her Lizzie dress from the play.
It hangs loosely, but still becomes her.
She's a beautiful bride.
Landon swells with pride.
Jamie smiles.
Then, leaning on her father, she slowly makes her way down the aisle.
In the pews -- few dry eyes follow her.
Jamie -- halfway -- stops to rest and catch her breath.
A moment later, she and her father continue.
A long, difficult walk.
A walk to remember.
The nurse rolls a wheelchair up as Jamie and her father near.
Applause breaks out as Jamie reaches Landon's side.
Jamie sits.
Exhausted.
Landon kneels to be the same height as Jamie in her chair.
Pause.
Dr. Carter kneels.
Showing solidarity with his son.
Reverend Sullivan, standing, leans down to kiss Jamie's cheek.
Trying to keep his emotions in check.
Reverend Sullivan towering over them.
Reverend Sullivan kneels, too.
Jamie takes Landon's hand in her right hand, her father's hand in her left.
Linking the three together.
The congregation silences.
Reverend Sullivan looks up from his Bible.
Struggling.
REV. SULLIVAN As a father, I'm supposed to give away my daughter.
REV. SULLIVAN But I can no more give Jamie away than I can give away my heart.
REV. SULLIVAN But I can let another share in the joy she has given me.
REV. SULLIVAN May God's blessings be with you both.
He reaches out, offering a hand to Landon.
Completing the circle.
REV. SULLIVAN Landon, repeat after me.
REV. SULLIVAN Do you take...
As words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged, the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the faces of those at the altar -- Jamie, Landon, Dr. Carter.
TO the first row of the congregation -- Cynthia Carter, Josh, Eric, Clay.
Then BACK row by row as the Reverend begins reading a passage from the book Jamie's mother made for her.
His voice soft and melodious, like a poet reading his own work.
REV. SULLIVAN 'Love is always patient and kind.
REV. SULLIVAN It is never jealous.
REV. SULLIVAN Love is never boastful or conceited.
REV. SULLIVAN It is never rude or selfish.
REV. SULLIVAN It does not take offense and is not resentful.
REV. SULLIVAN Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins, but delights in the truth.
REV. SULLIVAN It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes...'
And the CAMERA MOVES OUT the double doors to find...
PARSONAGE in a different season.
Winter.
UP the front steps and INTO...
As it is now, in present day.
The nurse disappears, leaving Landon Carter, 33, waiting.
Looking at a framed photo of Jamie as Lizzie in The Rainmaker...
The nurse returns, helping an old man as he shuffles in.
Reverend Sullivan.
He's stooped, thin, balding.
His skin parchment thin.
The two men embrace.
Stiff, uncomfortable, uncertain.
REV. SULLIVAN You've been well?
LANDON Yes.
LANDON You?
REV. SULLIVAN Getting by.
Pause.
Why is he here?
The Reverend waits.
LANDON I'm -- I'm returning something.
He twists the ring on his finger.
Removes it.
LANDON This belongs to you.
He gives his wedding ring to the Reverend.
Pause.
Landon searches for something meaningful to say.
LANDON She taught me -- everything.
LANDON She saved my life.
The Reverend turns away, overcome with sadness.
Realizing now why Landon has come.
REV. SULLIVAN You're marrying again.
LANDON Yes.
REV. SULLIVAN Jamie wanted that.
REV. SULLIVAN She told me.
Landon is grateful to know this.
He makes a move to go.
Then turns back.
LANDON I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
REV. SULLIVAN She did.
REV. SULLIVAN It was you.
Landon, deeply touched, embraces the old man again.
Warmly, fully.
Two men still grieving, saying good-bye.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) Jamie once said when you're feeling love, you're also feeling God.
Landon walks alone.
His hair and clothing tousled by a steady gentle wind.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) She made me a believer.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) In love.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) In life.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) In the journey that never ends...
Landon stops.
Faces the wind.
Lets the air swirl over him.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) ...
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) And in the mystery of all things you can't see but feel everywhere around you...
He closes his eyes.
She's there...
