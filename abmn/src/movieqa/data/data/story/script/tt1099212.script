TWILIGHT

Based on the novel by

February 11, 2008
Moss-draped.
Shadow-drenched.
Tortured tree trunks twist upward, reaching for rare sunlight.
BELLA (V.O.) I'd never given much thought to how I would die..
BELLA (V.O.) Then, in the distance, hear a tiny SNICK - a twig snapping.
BELLA (V.O.) Abruptly, we're on the move.
BELLA (V.O.) Fast.
Trees start whipping past us at a dizzying speed, branches are dodged with preternatural agility.
And we're speeding up, chasing something.
It's exhilarating.
Terrifying.
Finally, up ahead, we get the first glimpse of our prey -
-- running for its life as it darts through this maze of a forest.
It sprints forward, but we gain on it.
Beyond the deer, SEE the forest's edge ahead, white sunlight glowing against the trees.
The buck races for the light.
We're just behind it, about to emerge from the shadowy darkness -
BELLA (V.O.) The deer LEAPS into the light in a high arc, hovering (suddenly SLOW MOTION) against the WHITE GLARE of the sun...
BELLA (V.O.) then BAM!
The deer abruptly plummets out of frame at an unnatural angle, leaving the WHITE GLARE to fill the screen.
HOLD ON WHITENESS
BELLA (V.O.) But dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go..
BELLA (V.O.) -- Then into the WHITENESS steps the face of -
Eyes closed against the sunlight, absorbing its rays.
Long, dark hair frames alabaster skin.
She's a vulnerable, introverted, imperfect beauty.
BELLA (V.O.) ...
BELLA (V.O.) So I can't bring myself to regret the decision that brought me here to die...
BELLA (V.O.) The background comes into focus as we realize we're now in -
Bella stands at the end of a cul-de-sac on the desert's edge.
The sun blazes behind her -- she bends down and carefully scoops a tiny BARREL CACTUS into a clay pot.
BELLA (V.O.) ...
BELLA (V.O.) The decision to leave home.
She stares at the cactus in a state of reverie, until
Bye, Bella!
BELLA'S POV - McMansion ACROSS THE STREET
Three tanned, athletic, blonde GIRLS hop into a convertible Mercedes.
Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts with Bella's pale naturalness.
They wave.
Good luck at your new school!
They ADLIB superficial good wishes, "Don't forget to write;"
"We'll miss you."
Bella waves back, sweetly, but halfheartedly as she steps off the curb.
BELLA Have a good..
--and trips.
When she rights herself, they're already gone.
BELLA ...
BELLA life.
Clearly, not close friends.
Bella's grown-up demeanor and innate intelligence become apparent as -
BELLA BELLA'S MOTHER, RENE, mid 30's --exits their house --it's low rent for this ritzy neighborhood.
BELLA Rene is eclectic, scattered, anxious, more best friend than parent.
BELLA She thrusts a cell phone at Bella.
RENE It won't work again, baby.
BELLA You put it on hold.
RENE I did?
BELLA Look.
BELLA You also called Mexico.
Rene pushes her playfully, they laugh.
RENE I'll figure it out.
RENE You gotta be able to reach me and Phil on the road -
RENE love saying that - on the road.
BELLA Very romantic.
PHIL, 31, good looking with an athlete's body, exits the house, carrying Bella's three suitcases with ease.
If you call crappy motels, backwater towns and ballpark hot dogs romantic.
He puts his Phoenix Desert Dogs baseball hat on Rene's head with a kiss.
Phil's love of Rene reassures Bella.
Phil heads to the old station wagon to load the luggage, while Rene slips her arm through Bella's, clinging to her as they walk to car.
RENE Now, you know if you change your mind, I'll race back here from wherever the game is.
But Rene's strained expression tells us what a great sacrifice that would be.
Bella forces a smile.
BELLA I won't change my mind, mom.
RENE You might.
RENE You've always hated Forks.
BELLA It's not about Forks, it's about Dad.
BELLA I mean, two weeks a year, we barely know each other.
BELLA Mom, I want to go.
BELLA I'll be fine.
But as Rene hugs Bella, we see the truth on BELLA'S FACE dread, doubt, regret.
Off Bella, struggling to keep her facade up as she climbs into the back seat of the car..
Bella, IPOD earbuds in her ears, gets a last glimpse of the sparkling malls, chic shoppers, manicured cactus gardens..
The McMansions get smaller as we SWEEP OVER the scorched landscape, baking under a hot sun.
Beyond the housing developments SEE the rocky, dry desert, extending for miles..
BELLA Rise HIGHER, and higher still, until finally we're suspended within the bright, perfect, blue SKY, with only an occasional cloud..
BELLA Slowly, the clouds start getting more numerous, thicker, darker..
BELLA until we're completely immersed in them...
BELLA the sun disappearing.
BELLA Finally, we EMERGE from the clouds to find below
Nothing but deep, dark, green forests for miles.
SWEEP DOWN, finding the eerily dramatic Lake Crescent.
Over it all hangs the mist from the ever-present cloudy grey sky.
Everything is wet and green and drenched in shade..
BELLA FIND A TWO LANE HIGHWAY along which drives A POLICE CRUISER...
BELLA PUSH IN on the cruiser until we reach
Bella looks out, taking in her gloomy new surroundings..
Bella sits next to her uniformed father, police chief CHARLIE SWAN, 40's.
Taciturn, introverted like Bella.
Their strained silence contrasts Bella's relationship with her mother.
Beat.
CHARLIE Your hair's longer.
BELLA I cut it since last time I saw you.
CHARLIE Guess it grew out again.
She just nods.
Silence.
CHARLIE How's your mom?
BELLA Good.
BELLA They pass a SIGN: ?The City Of Forks Welcomes You - Pop.
3246.? Bella sighs.
As the cruiser drives through, Bella takes in this logging town
BELLA every storefront has a wood carving.
BELLA The Timber Museum's sign is two loggers sawing a stump.
BELLA The POLICE STATION is a small wooden building across from City Hall..
The cruiser pulls up to the old two-story house.
A woodshed full of firewood.
There's a small boat in the garage, fishing gear, an old buoy.
Bella climbs out...
home.
Bella and Charlie carry in her bags.
The house isn't stylish (the only new thing here is a Flat Screen T.V.), but it's comfortable, lived-in.
Lots of fishing memorabilia; photos of Charlie fishing with Quileute Indian BILLY BLACK.
Handmade cards to ?Daddy? and photos of Bella.
She winces at herself, age 7, in a tutu, sitting stubbornly on the ground.
CHARLIE I put Grandpa's old desk in your
CHARLIE And I cleared some shelves
CHARLIE in the bathroom.
BELLA That's right.
BELLA One bathroom.
Bella's eye lands on a PHOTO of a much younger Charlie and Rene, on vacation, beaming with love.
CHARLIE I'll just put these up in your room
BELLA I can do it
BELLA They both reach for the bags, bumping one another awkwardly.
BELLA Bella backs off, letting Charlie carry the bags upstairs.
An antique rolltop desk sits in a corner.
The room is filled with childhood remnants that have seen better days.
As she unpacks her CD case, loneliness finally overwhelms her.
She sits heavily on the edge of the bed, tears threatening..
BELLA Then we hear a HONK outside.
BELLA Bella runs across the hall and looks out the window to see
BELLA 11 OUTSIDE - A FADED RED TRUCK, CIRCA 1960 pulls up...
BELLA 11
Bella exits to find Charlie greeting the driver, JACOB BLACK, 16, Quileute Indian, amiable with long black hair, and hints of childish roundness in his face.
The two of them help Jacob's father, BILLY BLACK (from the photos), into a wheelchair.
CHARLIE Bella, you remember Billy Black.
BILLY Glad you're finally here.
BILLY Charlie hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming.
CHARLIE Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you down the hill.
BILLY Right after I ram you in the ankles.
Billy takes several rolls at Charlie, who dodges.
Jacob shakes his head at their two fathers as he shyly approaches Bella.
JACOB I'm Jacob.
JACOB We made mud pies together when we were little kids.
BELLA Yeah...
BELLA I think I remember..
BELLA Are they always like this?
JACOB It's getting worse with old age.
Charlie then pats the hood of the truck, addressing Bella
CHARLIE So what do you think of your homecoming gift?
BELLA No way.
BELLA The truck is for me?
CHARLIE Just bought it off Billy, here.
JACOB I rebuilt the engine and -
BELLA It's perfect!
She beams.
It's the first genuine smile we've seen on her.
She rushes to the truck.
Jacob eagerly joins her.
JACOB Okay, so you gotta double pump the clutch when you shift, but -
JACOB He hands her the keys as she climbs in.
BELLA Maybe I can give you a ride to school.
JACOB I go to school on the reservation.
BELLA Too bad.
BELLA Would've been nice to know at least one person.
As she starts up the truck we MATCH CUT
Loud, belching and turning heads as Bella parks, mortified.
All eyes are on her as she climbs out of her truck and steps in a PUDDLE, soaking her sneakers.
She slinks toward school, as we begin
-- Bella (never without her IPOD) makes her way thru kids who stare openly; a few brave ones say hi.
They're all talking about her.
This is her hell.
-- Bella wanders the walkways looking for room numbers, lost.
-- Constant stares at Bella, the outsider..
BELLA SERIES ENDS when a sweet, nerd-cute, motor mouth boy, ERIC, appears in her path.
ERIC You're Isabella Swan, the new girl.
ERIC Hi.
ERIC I'm Eric.
ERIC The eyes and ears of this place.
ERIC Anything you need.
ERIC Tour guide, lunch date, shoulder to cry on.
Bella just looks at him.
Is he for real?
BELLA I'm kind of the ?suffer in silence? type.
ERIC Good headline for your feature
ERIC I'm on the paper, and you're news, baby, front page.
BELLA I -- no, I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, not at all
ERIC Whoa, chillax.
ERIC No feature.
BELLA Would you mind just pointing me toward Mr. Varner's class?
He leads her away, enjoying the attentive stares, as she cringes from them
ERIC You've missed a lot of the semester, but I can hook you up - tutor, cliff notes, medical excuse..
The boys' basketball team runs drills on half the basketball court.
A girls' volleyball game occupies the other half.
Bella, in gym clothes, avoids the volleyball like it's radioactive.
An energetic, athletic team captain, JESSICA, motivates the players.
JESSICA Block it, Chloe!
JESSICA Yeah!
JESSICA Good attack!
Unfortunately, the volleyball heads toward Bella.
She closes her eyes and flails at it, SMACKING it.
It flies off court
JESSICA -- and beans a basketball player in the head.
JESSICA He is MIKE NEWTON, good looking, affable, with blond spiky hair.
MIKE Ow!
BELLA (hurries to him,
BELLA embarrassed) Are you alright?
BELLA I warned them not to make me play.
MIKE It's only a flesh wound.
Mike grins and she smiles, relieved.
A BELL RINGS, class over.
MIKE You're Isabella, right?
BELLA Just Bella.
MIKE I'm Mike.
MIKE Newton.
He looks at her a second too long, clearly taken by her -
MIKE Suddenly, Jessica appears, stepping between them.
MIKE Subtle, but possessive as she nudges Mike.
JESSICA She's got a great spike, doesn't she?
JESSICA So, you're from Arizona, right?
JESSICA Aren't people supposed to be tan down there?
BELLA That's why they kicked me out.
Mike laughs, and because he does, Jessica does.
Bella just feels uncomfortable with the attention..
FOLLOW Bella, Mike and Jessica as they carry their trays to a table.
Eric appears, and squishes into a seat next to Bella.
ERIC Mike, you met my home girl Bella.
MIKE Your home girl?
JESSICA It's first grade all over again, and you're the shiny new toy.
Bella smiles awkwardly.
Suddenly, a FLASHBULB blinds Bella.
She looks up at the photographer, ANGELA, Jessica's sweet, low key, insecure friend.
ANGELA Sorry, needed a candid for the feature
ERIC Feature's dead, Angela.
ERIC Don't bring it up again.
ERIC I got your back, baby.
ANGELA Guess we'll just run another editorial on teen drinking.
BELLA Sorry.
BELLA There's always eating disorders, or Speedo padding on the swim team
ANGELA -- Wait, that's a good one..
ANGELA But Bella's attention is now riveted to
They swing open as four of the most astounding people Bella's ever seen enter (IN SLOW MOTION): THE CULLENS.
Two guys, two girls, all chalky pale, purplish shadows under their eyes..
ANGELA and all devastatingly beautiful.
They move through the room with effortless grace, and take a seat at a table furthest from Bella's.
Bella leans over to Jessica and Angela.
BELLA Who are they?
ANGELA The Cullens.
Jessica leans in, swinging into gossip mode.
JESSICA Doctor and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids.
JESSICA They all moved down here from Alaska two years ago.
ANGELA They kinda keep to themselves.
JESSICA Because they're all together.
JESSICA Like, together together.
JESSICA The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett..
JESSICA ON ROSALIE, 18, long blonde hair, model beautiful, knows it.
JESSICA Alongside her is EMMETT, 17, big, brawny, like a weight lifter, but a playful glint in his eye.
JESSICA ...
JESSICA they're a thing.
JESSICA I'm not even sure that's legal.
ANGELA Jess, they're not actually related.
JESSICA But they live together.
JESSICA And the little dark haired girl, Alice, she's really weird..
JESSICA ON ALICE, 17, pixie-like, rail thin, light on her feet with short, black hair going in every direction.
JESSICA She hovers over, JASPER, 18, honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured.
JESSICA ...
JESSICA she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like he's in pain.
JESSICA mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad slash match maker.
ANGELA Maybe he'll adopt me.
Bella laughs, liking her...
then sees the last Cullen to enter
EDWARD, 17.
Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair.
He seems inwardly turned, mysterious.
More boyish than the others.
But the most striking of all.
Bella can't take her eyes off him.
BELLA Who's he?
JESSICA That's Edward Cullen.
Suddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from across the room.
His eyes meet Bella's.
But he seems..
JESSICA confused.
JESSICA Bella quickly looks away.
JESSICA He's totally gorgeous, obviously.
JESSICA But apparently, no one here is good enough for him.
JESSICA Like I care.
JESSICA Anyway, don't waste your time.
BELLA I wasn't planning on it.
A room of black-topped lab tables.
Two to a table.
Bella and Mike enter.
Mike takes his seat and points her toward MR.
MOLINA, Birkenstocked, enthusiastic science teacher at the head of the class.
As Bella moves to the teacher with her class slip, she notes
BELLA EDWARD -- his back to her, sitting at a front table.
BELLA But as she passes Edward's table..
BELLA SLOW MOTION -- the breeze she creates when she passes lifts a piece of paper next to Edward.
BELLA We're still on his back as he inhales --then abruptly stiffens.
BELLA He grabs onto the edge of the table, crumbling it slightly.
BELLA No one notices.
Mr. Molina takes Bella's class slip.
MR. MOLINA Welcome, Ms. Swan.
MR. MOLINA Follow along as best you can till you get caught up.
Mr. Molina gestures to the only empty seat...
next to Edward.
But as Bella approaches, she's taken aback when
MR. MOLINA ON EDWARD'S FACE -he slowly looks up at her, his eyes coal black with repulsion, fury.
MR. MOLINA If looks could literally kill..
MR. MOLINA Bella knocks someone's book bag off their chair.
MR. MOLINA Replaces it, mumbling an apology.
MR. MOLINA Then slinks reluctantly into her seat.
MR. MOLINA Edward jerks away from her to the extreme edge of his chair.
MR. MOLINA Today we'll be observing the behavior
MR. MOLINA As Mr. Molina distributes two petri dishes per table
MR. MOLINA We're going to cut them in half, then watch them regenerate into two separate worms..
MR. MOLINA Bella glances at Edward who averts his face, holding a hand over his nose as if he smells something horrible.
Bella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, smells nothing.
Then she sniffs her hair.
It's fine.
She's perplexed.
Mr.
Molina hands Edward two petri dishes.
MR. MOLINA ...
MR. MOLINA Yes, folks, zombie worms!
MR. MOLINA They just won't die.
Edward takes a dish, then slides the second one across the table to Bella as if she had Ebola.
She takes her dish, and makes a dark curtain of her hair between them.
She can see EDWARD'S HANDS under the table.
Clenched into fists.
Off Bella, utterly baffled, and deeply insecure..
-- as the BELL RINGS, Edward bolts out the door.
Other kids and Bella exit a moment later.
Bella looks down the hall; he's gone.
Bella enters, but nearly turns and leaves when she sees
MR. MOLINA EDWARD sweet-talking the enchanted female ADMINISTRATOR, 40's.
MR. MOLINA He doesn't see Bella enter.
EDWARD There must be something open sixth
period.
Physics?
Biochem?
No, every class is full.
I'm
afraid you'll have to stay in
biology.
I'm so sorry.
Bella blanches.
The Administrator sees her and gestures for her to wait a minute.
But Edward suddenly straightens as if sensing Bella.
He slowly turns to glare at her with piercing, hate-filled eyes.
She backs to the wall, hugging herself, suddenly chilled...
with fear.
EDWARD I'll just...
EDWARD endure it.
He strides out the door.
Off Bella..
Edward climbs into a shiny new silver Volvo with the Cullens, while Bella, upset, hurries to her truck.
The many eyes still watching her add insult to injury.
...
Finally, she reaches
-- and closes the door.
Her eyes well...
but she fights it, getting mad.
BELLA Jerk.
As she tries to start the car, choking the engine, we begin to hear a MAN'S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH
Extremely tight on his terrified FACE, sweat dripping, breathing in short gasps, trying desperately not to make a sound.
INCLUDE
--He's crouched in a dark corner.
But then he sees a SHADOW move blindingly fast past him.
He jerks around, then another SHADOW flies past, too fast to follow.
He BOLTS!
He runs up a flight of stairs, harsh lights from the exterior of the mill striating him.
He moves as fast as humanly possible
UNKNOWN POV charges after him at an INHUMAN SPEED through this maze of pillars and walkways.
We dodge skull-crushing beams, LEAP from one floor up to the next, up ladders, scaffolding, beams, up, and up, getting closer and closer to
-- who desperately runs for his life, looking over his shoulder with terror.
UNKNOWN POV is closing in on him, but then he BOLTS out a door
-- The guard BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his footing and TRIPS, breaking through the rail and pitching over the side, into the air
BELLA -- and stops, hovering mid-air, a yard from the landing.
BELLA HAND grips his shirt, then YANKS him out of the air and out of frame with incredible strength.
BELLA His guttural SCREAM is choked short as BLOOD SPRAYS THE LANDING..
ON A TOP SIRLOIN STEAK as it is set in front of Charlie.
He shares a table with Bella.
INCLUDE the waitress, CORA, 30's.
She beams at Bella as she sets a plate of cod in front of her.
Several LOGGERS at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles.
She shrinks in her seat at the attention.
Charlie's oblivious.
CORA Can't get over how grown up you
CORA Bella glances at Charlie, who keeps his eyes on his steak.
CORA bearded, hippy logger, WAYLON FORGE, 50, appears behind Cora, leaning over her shoulder to Bella
WAYLON ?Member me, honey?
WAYLON I was Santa one year.
CHARLIE Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four.
WAYLON Bet I made an impression, though.
CHARLIE You always do.
CORA Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon.
CORA When you're done, I'll bring your favorite - berry cobbler.
CORA Remember?
CORA Your dad still has it.
CORA Every Thursday.
BELLA That'd be great, thank you.
BELLA A burst of LAUGHTER from a nearby happy FAMILY only serves to emphasize their discomfort.
BELLA Bella tries to bridge the gap.
BELLA So...
BELLA you eat here every night?
CHARLIE Easier than washing dishes.
BELLA I can cook.
He looks up, as if confused by the concept.
BELLA I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix.
BELLA Mom's not great in the kitchen.
CHARLIE I remember..
CHARLIE They both laugh -- recalling an especially bad dinner.
CHARLIE How was school?
CHARLIE Meet anyone?
BELLA A few people...
BELLA Do you know the Cullen family?
CHARLIE Are people talking about them again?
BELLA No...
BELLA well, a little.
CHARLIE Just ?cause they're newcomers.
CHARLIE We're lucky to have a surgeon like Dr.
CHARLIE Cullen at our podunk hospital.
CHARLIE Lucky his wife wanted to live in a small town.
CHARLIE Lucky his kids aren't like a lot of the hell-raisers around here.
BELLA ...
BELLA Okay.
CHARLIE I just don't like narrow mindedness.
Bella looks out at the fog as she talks on the phone.
CHARLIE If spring training goes well, we could be living in Florida permanently.
Please insert 25 cents to continue.
BELLA Mom, where's your cell?
Rene talks on a pay phone, her dead cell phone in her hand.
In the b.g., Phil and an Attendant work on the Subaru engine.
RENE Ok, I didn't lose my power cord.
RENE It ran away.
RENE Screaming.
RENE I literally repel technology now.
Bella smiles, missing her mom.
Rene feeds the phone quarters.
RENE Now, tell me more about your
RENE like?
RENE Are there any cute guys?
RENE Are they being nice to you?
BELLA They've all been really..
BELLA welcoming.
PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE, getting mad all over again as..
ON BELLA, sitting atop a table, an open book in her lap.
But her eyes are on the arriving kids, and the parking lot as they pull in.
She's waiting for Edward.
Jessica, Angela, Mike and Eric kick around a soccerball nearby.
They wave Bella to join them but she smiles, declining...
and returns to watching for Edward.
Her face tells us she's ready for a confrontation.
Bella strides in...
but stops, surprised to find her lab table empty.
Off Bella, frustrated..
Bella sits with Jessica and Angela who watch a YouTube video on their phone.
Bella gives it a cursory look, but is focused on the Cullen table --only four of them.
Edward's seat is empty..
Bella washes her hands, then looks up at the mirror, startled to find Rosalie and Alice behind her.
They study Bella, Rosalie with chillingly cold eyes, Alice with curiosity.
Bella, uneasy, hurries out.
Bella exits with Angela, Mike, Jessica and Eric, becoming a part of this circle.
She now only glances at Rosalie's car, a red M3 BMW, as it drives past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward.
Bella returns to her friends, finally forgetting about him..
BELLA SERIES OF SCENES ENDS as we go to
It's neater, rearranged more attractively.
Clearly, Bella's given it her touch.
She sweeps through, folding Charlie's fleece jacket, straightening up.
She grabs her book bag
BELLA Dad, I'm heading out.
ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay filling her.
It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of puddles, some frozen.
Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight.
BELLA Great.
BELLA WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her truck.
BELLA Dad, I can drive myself to school.
As she walks down the steps, she doesn't realize, something's watching her -
--tracking Bella's every move as she slips and falls on a
patch of ice -
BELLA BACK ON BELLA - fallen on her ass.
BELLA Charlie climbs out of the truck, helps her up.
CHARLIE You okay, Bells?
BELLA Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated.
CHARLIE That's why I got you new tires.
CHARLIE She looks over at the truck -- yep, four new tires.
CHARLIE The other ones were nearly bald.
BELLA You got me new tires.
BELLA No one's ever done that before.
Charlie looks at her, confused.
BELLA I mean...
BELLA nothing.
He clearly doesn't get it as heads toward his Cruiser.
CHARLIE I'll be late for dinner.
CHARLIE I'm heading down to Mason County.
CHARLIE A security guard at the Grisham Mill got killed by some kind of animal..
CHARLIE UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND CHARLIE, as he speaks..
BELLA An animal?
CHARLIE You're not in Phoenix any more, honey.
CHARLIE They've been hunting it for a week with no luck.
CHARLIE Thought I'd lend a hand.
BELLA Be careful.
CHARLIE Always am.
BELLA And thank you.
BELLA For the tires.
He sees emotion in her eyes.
Doesn't understand it, but nods, heads inside.
Bella looks at the tires again, oddly moved..
Rain beats on the roof as Eric walks Bella into class.
She brushes water off her coat as he chats her up.
ERIC ...
ERIC and yeah, prom committee is a chick thing, but I gotta cover it for the paper anyway, and they need a guy to help choose the music -
ERIC So I need your play list
Bella is about to respond when Mike comes up behind her.
MIKE Come on, Arizona.
MIKE Give it up for the rain.
And he shakes his wet baseball cap onto Bella's head.
BELLA Terrific.
BELLA Bella straightens, girding herself.
BELLA Then strides to the table, and confidently drops her books down, ready to address him.
BELLA But he looks up at her
EDWARD Hello.
Bella stops.
Stunned.
He is direct, precise, as if every word is an effort for him.
EDWARD I didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week.
EDWARD My name is Edward Cullen.
She's too shocked that he's talking to her to answer.
EDWARD ...
EDWARD You're Bella.
BELLA I'm...
BELLA yes.
Feeling like an idiot, she quickly sits.
He abruptly moves to the extreme edge of his seat.
She's even more baffled now.
MR. MOLINA Onion root tip cells!
MR. MOLINA That's what's on your slides.
MR. MOLINA Separate and label them into the phases of mitosis.
MR. MOLINA The first partners to get it right, win...
MR. MOLINA the golden onion!
He excitedly holds up a spray painted onion.
Everyone just looks at him.
He's disappointed by their apathy.
MR. MOLINA Come on, people.
MR. MOLINA Tick tock.
Everyone sets to work.
Edward pushes the microscope to Bella, keeping his distance, his voice controlled.
EDWARD Ladies first.
She grabs the microscope defensively and snaps the first slide in, adjusting the lens.
She's curt as she addresses him.
BELLA You've been gone.
EDWARD Out of town.
EDWARD For personal reasons.
She glances at him but he just leans far away, his face tight.
She looks back into the microscope.
BELLA Prophase.
She begins to remove the slide.
EDWARD May I look?
She slides him the microscope.
He glances through the lens.
EDWARD Prophase.
BELLA Like I said.
He writes it on the worksheet.
Then he takes a breath, as if trying calm himself, and turns to her with enormous effort.
EDWARD Enjoying the rain?
BELLA Seriously?
BELLA You're asking me about the weather?
EDWARD It appears.
BELLA No.
BELLA I don't like the cold.
BELLA Or the wet.
BELLA Or the gray.
BELLA Or parkas.
BELLA Or turtle necks.
Is that a smile playing on his lips?
For the first time, he seems more intrigued than agonized.
He studies her.
She still can't tell if he despises her or not.
It's infuriating.
BELLA What?
BELLA the slides.
BELLA She looks at him.
BELLA And keeps looking..
His cheekbones, his lips.
So perfect, like a sculpture..
EDWARD Anaphase.
EDWARD She snaps out of it.
EDWARD Covers with a dry look.
BELLA May I?
BELLA Anaphase.
EDWARD Like I said.
She glances at him, and this time sees a smirk.
She simply holds out her hand for another slide.
EDWARD If you hate cold and rain, why move to the wettest place in the continental U.S.
BELLA It's complicated.
EDWARD I think I can keep up.
He actually seems interested.
She looks into the microscope as
BELLA My mother remarried.
EDWARD Very complex.
EDWARD So you don't like him.
BELLA Phil is fine.
BELLA Young for her, but nice enough.
BELLA Interphase.
Bella exits holding the golden onion, and practically runs into Edward, who's directly in front of her.
EDWARD Why didn't you stay with your mom
EDWARD He waits for her answer, studying her, as if trying to decipher her.
EDWARD She's drawn in by his attention, oddly compelled.
BELLA Alright, Phil's a minor league
BELLA lot.
BELLA My mother stayed home with me
but it made her unhappy.
So
BELLA decided to spend time with my
father.
EDWARD But now you're unhappy.
BELLA No...
BELLA I -- I just..
BELLA Bella turns away -- embarrassed, vulnerable.
EDWARD I'm just trying to figure you out.
EDWARD You're very hard to read.
EDWARD He's clearly trying to read her now...
EDWARD their eyes meet again.
EDWARD But now she looks more closely at him.
BELLA Did you get contacts?
EDWARD ...
EDWARD no.
BELLA Your eyes were black before, now
they're this golden brown or
EDWARD It's just the fluorescents.
He abruptly turns and walks away.
As he does, Bella notes -
EDWARD HIS HANDS clenched into tight fists.
EDWARD Off Bella, utterly bewildered, both intrigued and frustrated.
The rain has stopped, but the parking lot is full of water and patches of black ice.
Shivering, Bella heads for her truck, carrying the onion, carefully navigating the icy puddles.
As she reaches her truck, she looks across the lot
EDWARD stands by his silver Volvo with his siblings, about to climb in.
A moment as their eyes meet...
then he looks toward the sound of a high pitched SCREECH, that quickly grows LOUDER..
EDWARD Bella turns to see a VAN -- skidding on the ice, careening out of control, heading directly for her.
EDWARD TIME suddenly fractures, compressing to stillness, then exploding in bursts of speed as
EDWARD -- THE FACES OF THE STUDENTS - in shock, seeing what's coming.
EDWARD --THE VAN DRIVER'S FACE -TYLER, desperately trying to gain control, then shielding his face.
EDWARD -- EDWARD'S FACE - looking at Bella with horror..
EDWARD THE VAN is about to hit Bella's truck, with her standing in between, when suddenly, something knocks Bella down, pinning her to the ground.
EDWARD She looks up - Edward is on top of her.
The world around them FREEZES -- in this fraction of a second, their proximity is overwhelming, electrifying.
He breathes in her scent, she takes in his flawless face..
EDWARD Abruptly, we BLAST BACK TO SPEED as several things happen so
quickly, we, and Bella, are unsure what's going on:
-- THE VAN SMASHES into the back of Bella's truck
EDWARD -- Then SPINS around, once again careening toward her and Edward, then suddenly
EDWARD --EDWARD'S HANDS are creating a deep dent in the side of the van's body as it shudders to a stop, a foot from Bella.
EDWARD -- Edward literally pushes the van away.
Then silence.
A long beat, void of any sound, as Bella looks at Edward, trying to absorb what just happened.
Edward's fear for her is still alive on his face.
She starts to speak but..
THE SCREAMING begins, yelling, calls for help.
People leap to Tyler's aid, run to Bella and Edward.
Bella SEES the onion on the ground, smashed as she would have been.
As everyone sweeps in, Edward moves into the b.g.
Mike and Eric run to Bella
Are you okay!?
Are you What happened!?
Did anyone
hurt?!
see what happened?
Amid the chaos, Bella sees EDWARD'S SIBLINGS looking at Edward.
But they show no hint of concern for his safety.
Instead, they look at him with disapproval...
and fury.
The double doors BURST open as Charlie runs in, face white with terror.
He spots
BELLA - sitting on a gurney, the E.R. DOCTOR looking into her eyes with a pen light.
On the next gurney over, Tyler, the van's driver, lies with a mild head wound.
Charlie rushes up.
CHARLIE Bells.
CHARLIE Are you alright?
BELLA I'm fine, dad.
BELLA Calm down.
TYLER I'm so sorry, Bella.
TYLER I tried to stop.
BELLA It's okay, Tyler.
CHARLIE It sure as hell is not okay.
BELLA Dad, it's not his fault-
CHARLIE We nearly lost you.
BELLA But you didn't.
He'd hug her, if that was who he, or who she was.
Instead, he glares at Tyler.
CHARLIE You can kiss your license goodbye.
CHARLIE I heard the Chief's daughter was here.
They look up as DR.
CARLISLE CULLEN, mid 30's, approaches, blond, movie star handsome.
His face is kind, but pale, tired.
CHARLIE Good.
CHARLIE Dr. Cullen.
DR. CULLEN I've got this one, Jackie.
The E.R. Doctor hands Dr. Cullen the chart, exits.
Dr. Cullen reviews her chart, then feels the back of her head as..
DR. CULLEN You have a nice knot growing back there, but your x-rays show no indication of concussion.
TYLER I'm so sorry, Bella.
TYLER I'm really
TYLER Charlie abruptly pulls the curtain between them.
BELLA It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of the way.
CHARLIE Edward?
CHARLIE Your boy?
Dr. Cullen quickly looks back at the chart.
Bella's intuition flickers, sensing he knows something.
She presses.
BELLA It was amazing he got to me so fast.
BELLA He was nowhere near me.
DR. CULLEN As long as you're safe.
Charlie and Bella exit the treatment area.
CHARLIE I just have to sign some paperwork.
CHARLIE You better call your mom.
BELLA You told her?!
BELLA She's probably freaking.
He shrugs and hurries off.
Bella shakes her head, pulls out her cell phone.
Is about to dial, but then sees down the hall..
Rosalie is clearly furious at Edward who stands his ground.
Dr. Cullen plays intermediary.
ROSALIE This isn't just about you, it's about all of us -
ROSALIE Dr. Cullen sees Bella and stops Rosalie
DR. CULLEN Let's take this in my office.
Rosalie glares at Edward as she goes off with Dr. Cullen.
Edward adopts a nonchalant air as Bella approaches, determined.
BELLA Can I talk to you for a moment?
BELLA How did you get over to me so quickly?
EDWARD I was standing right next to you.
BELLA You were next to your car, across the lot.
He steps closer to her.
His expression turns icy hard.
EDWARD No, I wasn't.
She won't be bullied.
Steps closer to him.
BELLA Yes.
BELLA You were.
EDWARD You're confused.
EDWARD You hit your head.
BELLA I know what I saw.
EDWARD And what, exactly, was that?
BELLA You stopped that van.
BELLA You pushed it away.
EDWARD No one will believe that.
BELLA I wasn't planning to tell anyone.
This registers with Edward.
They're inches from each other, the tension thick.
BELLA I just want to know the truth.
EDWARD Can't you just thank me and get over it?
BELLA Thank you.
A long beat as they look at each other, angry, defensive...
and without a doubt, attracted.
EDWARD You're not going to let it go, are you?
BELLA No.
EDWARD Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
BELLA Why did you even bother?
He stops, a beat.
Looks back at her, unexpectedly vulnerable.
EDWARD ...
EDWARD I don't know.
And he keeps walking.
Off Bella, confused, frustratingly attracted, and absolutely determined to find out the truth.
EDWARD That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen..
Bella swims, white skin aglow, hair floating weightlessly, sensually...
suddenly, something BLASTS past her.
She spins.
It's gone.
Something BLASTS behind her.
She spins again - to find herself face to face with
EDWARD EDWARD ...
EDWARD Bella reaches for him, but he abruptly springs backward, just out of reach.
-as she bolts up awake.
In that split second, in the darkness, she SEES Edward, watching her.
She SNAPS on the light -- the room is empty.
Was she dreaming?
Bella stands in the exact spot of the accident.
Behind her on the lawn, several CLASSES congregate, gathering for a field trip.
Mr. Molina is in charge.
MR. MOLINA Make sure I get your permission slips.
PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE staring at the skid marks on the pavement..
MR. MOLINA BACK ON BELLA, blushing at the memory.
MR. MOLINA Then she SEES Edward arrive with Alice and Jasper.
MR. MOLINA She watches him, barely noticing as Mike trots up to her -
MIKE Look!
MIKE You're moving.
MIKE You're ALIVE!
BELLA ...
BELLA Yeah, false alarm..
MIKE Actually, I'm glad you're not dead ?cause - well, that would suck, plus
MIKE wanted to ask you - even though it's, like, a month away..
MIKE But Bella's distracted by Edward.
MIKE Mike's VOICE DIPS as..
Edward, head down, is in quiet conference with Jasper and Alice.
Abruptly, he looks up, as if listening to her and Mike, though he's too far away to hear.
Bella quickly refocuses on Mike.
MIKE So what do you think?
MIKE You want to go?
MIKE To prom.
MIKE With me.
BELLA Prom.
BELLA As in dance.
BELLA I, uh - have to go
-somewhere.
To Jacksonville.
Yeah.
MIKE You can't go another weekend?
BELLA Non-refundable ticket.
BELLA Maybe you should ask Jessica.
Mike follows Bella's eyes way across the lawn to Jessica.
She smiles at them -- Suddenly Edward crosses in front of Jessica.
He seems to be smirking..
Mr. Molina and a Tour Guide lead several dozen kids through the greenhouse.
Bella keeps an eye on Edward who's up ahead with Alice and Jasper.
Mr. Molina demonstrates the compost machine as the students mess around.
MR. MOLINA ...c'mon, Eric, stuff that compost down deep...
MR. MOLINA that's it..
MR. MOLINA ...
MR. MOLINA now Tyler, take a big steaming cup of ?compost tea.? This is recycling at its most basic level -
MR. MOLINA hey, don't drink that!
When Bella sees Edward pause by an ancient staghorn fern, alone, she takes a breath for courage and strides up to him.
BELLA Hello, Edward.
He glances at her, merely nodding.
We notice his FISTS clench, and unclench.
Bella looks at him, appalled by his rudeness.
BELLA Really?
No response.
She turns, starts to walk away.
EDWARD What's in Jacksonville?
She turns back to him.
BELLA How did you know about that?
EDWARD You didn't answer my question.
BELLA You haven't answered any of mine.
BELLA You won't even say hello.
EDWARD Hello.
BELLA And how did you stop that van?
EDWARD Adrenaline rush.
EDWARD Very common.
EDWARD Google it.
BELLA Floridians.
BELLA That's what's in Jacksonville.
She turns to storm off but she stumbles over the irrigation hose.
Edward steadies her, catching her scent -- still so powerful...
He clenches his jaw.
EDWARD It helps if you actually watch where you put your feet.
Insulted, she keeps moving.
He keeps pace, serious now.
EDWARD I know I've been rude, but it's for the best.
She just looks at him like he's crazy.
He walks away as Jessica suddenly rushes up.
JESSICA Guess who just asked me to prom!
Bella smiles.
JESSICA I totally thought Mike was going to ask you, Bella.
JESSICA Is it gonna be weird?
BELLA No way.
BELLA Zero weirdness.
BELLA You guys are great together.
JESSICA I know, right?
Giddy, Jessica rushes to catch up with Angela.
Bella heads out the door that leads to
--where everyone's looking at the COMPOST ?WORM BOX?, grossing each other out with the slimy creatures.
As Bella backs away, Edward steps up.
EDWARD Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends.
BELLA Too bad you didn't figure that out earlier.
BELLA (cont'd) You could have let the van crush me and saved yourself all this regret.
EDWARD You think I regret saving you?
BELLA I know you do.
EDWARD You don't know anything.
His harshness stings her.
Suddenly, Alice appears at Edward's side.
She eyes Bella with curiosity.
ALICE The bus is leaving.
ALICE Hi.
ALICE Will you be riding with us?
EDWARD No.
EDWARD Our bus is full.
He purposefully walks Alice away.
But he glances back at Bella with, is that...
remorse?
She doesn't see it.
Bella enters, throws down her book bag and coat, still angry.
She starts upstairs but Charlie enters from the kitchen.
CHARLIE Your mother called.
CHARLIE Again.
BELLA Your fault, for telling her about the accident.
CHARLIE She always did know how to worry.
CHARLIE But...
CHARLIE she's changed, too.
CHARLIE She seems happy.
CHARLIE Phil sounds all right.
BELLA He is.
She continues upstairs, glancing at her parents' WEDDING PHOTO.
Off Bella's FACE, we MATCH CUT -
-- as she pushes through the doors.
She glances over at the CULLEN TABLE, Edward with his siblings.
He doesn't look at her.
Anger and determination set in again as Bella joins Eric, Jessica, Mike and Angela.
She drops her book bag on a seat
ERIC La Push, baby.
ERIC You in?
BELLA Should I know what that means?
MIKE La Push beach, down on the Quileute rez.
MIKE We're all going after school.
MIKE Big swell coming in.
ERIC And I don't just surf the internet.
JESSICA Eric, you stood up once.
JESSICA On a foam board.
ANGELA There's whale watching, too.
ANGELA Come with.
ERIC La Push, baby.
BELLA I'll go if you stop saying that.
Bella artfully designs an architectural salad.
As she reaches for an APPLE, Edward is suddenly next to her
EDWARD Edible art..
EDWARD Startled, she fumbles and drops the apple -- Edward catches it with his foot, hackeysack style, then bounces it back into his hand, the red of the apple, stark against his pale skin.
EDWARD He presents it to her with small smile.
BELLA Thanks...
BELLA but your mood swings are giving me whiplash.
EDWARD I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.
BELLA What does that even mean?
EDWARD It means if you were smart, you'd avoid me.
EDWARD She notes her own, very human friends monitoring this conversation from their table.
EDWARD Mike glowers jealously.
BELLA So let's say, for argument's sake, that I'm not smart.
BELLA Would you talk to me?
BELLA Tell me the truth?
EDWARD Probably not.
EDWARD I'd rather hear your theories.
BELLA Okay...
BELLA how ?bout radioactive spiders?
BELLA Kryptonite?
EDWARD (levels his gaze,
EDWARD challenging) You're talking about superheroes.
EDWARD What if I'm not a hero?
EDWARD What if I'm a bad guy?
BELLA No.
BELLA I don't believe that.
BELLA You're not bad.
BELLA You can be a jerk, but it's like this...
BELLA mask.
BELLA To keep people away.
He's taken aback by her honesty, her insight, drawn in by her..
BELLA Look, why don't we just - hang out.
BELLA Like...
BELLA come to the beach with us.
BELLA It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes..
EDWARD Which beach?
BELLA La Push.
His smile lessens almost imperceptibly.
BELLA Is something wrong with that beach?
Edward glances over at Mike - the two exchange cold looks.
EDWARD It's just a little crowded.
Off Bella, as Edward walks away..
It's freezing, but Mike, Tyler, Jessica and others suit up for a surf.
Eric hangs with them.
Bella wanders by the driftwood with Angela, who takes photographs.
ANGELA I keep thinking Eric's going to ask me to prom, then he just...
ANGELA doesn't.
BELLA You could ask him.
BELLA (off Angela's flustered
BELLA You're a strong independent woman.
ANGELA I am?
ANGELA Bella!
She looks up to see three Quileute boys approaching the group; Jacob Black, and SAM and EMBRY.
Bella smiles at Jacob.
BELLA Guys, this is Jacob.
BELLA Are you stalking me?
JACOB You're on my rez, remember?
JACOB You surfing?
BELLA Definitely not.
JESSICA Keep her company.
JESSICA Her date bailed.
ERIC What date?
JESSICA She invited Edward.
BELLA To be polite.
ANGELA I think it's nice she invited him.
ANGELA No one ever does.
MIKE Because Cullen's a freak.
SAM You got that right.
BELLA You know them?
SAM The Cullens don't come here.
Jacob shoots Sam a look, shakes his head.
Bella registers this.
A beat, then she casually pulls Jacob aside
BELLA You want to go look at tide pools?
She offers an awkwardly flirtatious smile.
He grins, infatuated.
As they head toward the water..
Bella and Jacob wander near the water, looking out to sea for whales.
The surfers are out on the waves.
She nudges him, continuing her attempt at flirtation..
BELLA So, what did your friend mean about the Cullens not coming here?
JACOB Oops.
JACOB Caught that, huh?
He moves closer to her, lowering his voice for mock-secrecy.
JACOB I'm not supposed to say anything.
Bella gives him her best alluring smile.
BELLA I can keep a secret..
JACOB It's just an old scary story.
JACOB Did you know the Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
BELLA Like fur, fangs ...
BELLA doggy breath?
Jacob chuckles.
Bella smiles and prompts him to continue..
BELLA So the legend about the Cullens is..
JACOB Well, they're supposedly descended from this, like..
JACOB ?enemy clan.? ...
JACOB But they claimed to be different, so we made a treaty with them.
BELLA Didn't they just move here?
JACOB Or just moved back.
BELLA Riiiight.
BELLA So what was this treaty?
JACOB If they promised to stay off Quileute lands, we wouldn't expose what they really were to the pale-faces..
JACOB Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers.
JACOB Bella JUMPS at the bloodcurdling scream, as Angela runs past, chased by Eric waving a dead crustacean.
JACOB Jacob smirks and starts back to the group.
BELLA Wait...
BELLA what were they really?
JACOB It's just a story, Bella.
Off Bella, with more unanswered questions..
A collection of haphazard shacks and boat docks, connected by wood plank sidewalks.
FIND Waylon Forge (the hippy logger who used to play Santa Claus) scraping paint off his boat, swigging a pint as he listens to his prehistoric Walkman.
His old DOG lies next to him as the sounds of the forest and river chirp and buzz.
Waylon sings along to his Walkman..
JACOB Suddenly, the sounds of nature abruptly SILENCE themselves.
JACOB The dog raises his head, starts to GROWL.
JACOB Waylon doesn't notice.
STAY ON WAYLON, singing, working...
until he looks up and realizes the dog's gone.
WAYLON Jerry?
Waylon pulls off the headphones.
WHISTLES.
No dog.
Waylon walks up a walkway...
then sees a DOG LEG, sticking out from under a bush.
WAYLON Come on, Jerry, you old mutt..
WAYLON He pulls at the leg.
WAYLON It's detached.
WAYLON He reels back, stumbling onto his boat, frantically untying the line and pushing out
WAYLON ON THE WATER - Waylon floats, breath short, listening acutely.
WAYLON'S POV -ON THE WOODS lining the river.
Ominous darkness.
A NOISE.
He jerks around.
Nothing.
Then suddenly, his boat ROCKS violently; he spins
WAYLON A MAN - now stands on the bow.
WAYLON JAMES, 30, pale white.
WAYLON vampire.
WAYLON But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a deep, sinister BURGUNDY, and absolutely lethal.
WAYLON His catlike movements are always on the edge of a crouch.
WAYLON H-how did you do that?
JAMES Always the same inane questions..
JAMES Waylon turns but a woman LEAPS onto the bow --it's VICTORIA, 26, chaotic red hair filled with leaves from the woods.
JAMES Terrified, Waylon spins around to see LAURENT, 28, glossy black hair, olive skin, lounging on his boat seat.
JAMES All three Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all three are bare foot.
JAMES ?What do you want?
VICTORIA ?Why are you doing this?
LAURENT ...
LAURENT James, must we?
JAMES The question should be, ?will it hurt?
JAMES Victoria grins sadistically.
JAMES Then with lightening fast speed, the three of them VIOLENTLY LUNGE
SNAPSHOTS of his eyes, his cheekbones, his lips..
As she sits in front of her computer, lost in thought.
She shakes herself out of it and types into her search engine ?Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula.? An AD pops up, ?Thunderbird & Whale Book Store, Port Angeles.? Bella, intrigued, clicks on it..
The sun has come out and so has the skin.
Kids are in shorts though it's still barely sixty degrees.
Everyone eats lunch outdoors.
Bella searches the crowd for Edward.
JAMES He's not here.
She looks down to find Jessica sitting on the grass.
JESSICA Whenever the weather's nice, the
Cullens disappear.
BELLA They just...
BELLA ditch?
JESSICA No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank ?em
JESSICA stuff.
JESSICA I tried the idea out on my
JESSICA Bella registers this as Angela suddenly jumps on them.
ANGELA I'm going to the prom with Eric!
ANGELA just asked him, I took control!
ANGELA Are you sure you have to go out of town?
BELLA It's a family thing.
JESSICA Oh my God, we need to hit the stores in Port Angeles before the dresses get cleaned out.
BELLA Port Angeles?..
BELLA Can I go with you guys?
ANGELA Thank God.
ANGELA We need your opinion.
Off Bella, that's not really what she had in mind..
-- antsy, distracted, as Jessica and Angela try on dresses.
Bella pulls a Mapquest print-out from her purse -- it reads, ?Thunderbird and Whale Book Store.? Jessica flounces out of the changing room, posing provocatively.
JESSICA I think this halter makes my boobs look big.
JESSICA What do you think, Bella?
Outside the window, a group of rowdy FRAT BOYS head toward a bar.
Two of them stare at Jessica in her low-cut dress.
Embarrassed, she turns back to Bella.
JESSICA Bella?
BELLA It looks great.
JESSICA You said that about the last five dresses.
ANGELA You're not very good at this, are you?
BELLA Maybe I should just go check out the
BELLA book store and meet you at the
BELLA restaurant later.
ANGELA You sure?
Bella nods, heads out.
Jessica's looks in the mirror again.
JESSICA She was right about this halter,
Bella exits, thumbing through a BOOK she just bought.
She heads down the sidewalk, but then hears FOOTSTEPS behind her.
She turns, doesn't see anyone.
She puts the book in her shoulder bag and continues.
UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA -someone's following her.
She looks around, changing course to cut across a parking lot.
Unknown POV gets closer...
and closer, until she reaches
Isolated.
Bella, breath short, scared, turns around just as -
JESSICA TWO MEN emerge from the shadows, not vampires, but the Frat Boys, really wasted now.
Wanna beer?
She looks to her left; the other TWO GUYS are there.
She's cornered.
She takes her purse from around her shoulder.
BELLA Look, just take my bag.
We don't want your bag.
She takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her wrist to use her purse as a mace.
They chortle derisively.
But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in the groin.
The BOOK in her bag doubles him over.
The other three laugh, and start to close in.
But suddenly
HEADLIGHTS blind them.
A silver Volvo screeches up.
The Frat Boys dive out of the way.
The passenger-side door opens.
It's Edward.
She's too stunned to even move.
EDWARD Get in.
She finally does.
But Frat Boy #2 jumps into the game and rushes Edward's side of the car
EDWARD Edward SCREECHES to a halt and is out of the car and facing Frat Boy #2 so fast, neither the Frat Boys, nor Bella, see it.
EDWARD Nor does Bella see Edward's GLARE, so chilling, so animalistic in its fury that Frat Boy #2, scared, instinctively backs off.
EDWARD As Edward climbs back into the car, Bella just stares at him.
Bella continues to stare.
She sees that he's seething with anger, hands gripping the steering wheel, jaw clenched.
BELLA What -- no, how did you find --
EDWARD I should go back and rip their heads off.
BELLA No.
BELLA Bad idea.
EDWARD You don't know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking.
BELLA And you do?
EDWARD Not hard to guess.
Jessica and Angela exit the restaurant as Bella approaches.
ANGELA Where were you!?
ANGELA We left you a message.
JESSICA We waited, but we were starving
JESSICA Then they see Edward behind her, climbing out of his car.
JESSICA They freeze, agog.
JESSICA He's composed now, making an effort to be charming.
JESSICA And they are charmed.
EDWARD Sorry I kept Bella from dinner.
EDWARD We ran into each other and got talking.
JESSICA I - we - understand.
JESSICA We were just...
JESSICA leaving, so
JESSICA The two girls start to go.
JESSICA Bella is forced to go with them.
BELLA Okay, well.
BELLA Thank you.
She starts to follow the girls.
Edward is torn, then abruptly
EDWARD Maybe I should make sure Bella gets something to eat.
EDWARD look) ...
EDWARD If you'd like.
EDWARD Then I could drive you back myself.
ANGELA That's so...
ANGELA thoughtful.
JESSICA Really thoughtful.
BELLA I could eat.
As he guides her off, the two girls share a look, and a noiseless scream of excitement.
Bella and Edward sit on the deck.
A dramatic waterfall shimmers behind them.
A waitress places a steaming plate of mesquite roasted salmon in front of Bella and nothing in front of Edward.
She exits.
BELLA You're not eating?
EDWARD I'm on a special diet.
BELLA Like South Beach?
EDWARD Not exactly.
She looks at him curiously as she takes a bite.
BELLA So how ?bout some answers?
EDWARD Yes, no.
EDWARD To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.
BELLA I didn't ask for the square root of pi.
EDWARD You knew that?
BELLA How did you know where I was?
EDWARD I didn't.
She shakes her head, frustrated, and turns to go inside -
EDWARD Don't go.
He seems torn by some internal dilemma.
Then finally..
BELLA Were you following me?
EDWARD I feel very protective of you.
BELLA So that's a yes?
EDWARD Yes, I followed you.
EDWARD I tried to keep my distance...until you needed help.
BELLA You said before...
BELLA That you heard what those guys were thinking..
BELLA Can you...
BELLA read minds?
EDWARD I'm thinking of getting a nine- hundred number.
BELLA Alright, so you read minds...
BELLA What am I thinking?
BELLA Wait -- okay now, go.
EDWARD I have no idea.
EDWARD I can read every mind in there, except yours.
EDWARD Work, sex, money, sex, sex, boyfriend
EDWARD Nothing.
EDWARD It's quite frustrating.
BELLA Why, what's wrong with me?
EDWARD I tell you I read minds and you think there's something wrong with you?
He smiles, charmed by her.
But his smile fades, that torn look returns.
He holds onto the rail, looking out.
BELLA What is it?
EDWARD I...
EDWARD don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore.
She's surprised.
And thrilled.
BELLA Edward, you don't have to.
He's drawn in by her encouraging gaze...
but he closes his eyes a beat, and turns back to the water.
EDWARD This is wrong.
BELLA Edward
EDWARD You're cold.
EDWARD We should go.
He walks away before she can ask any more questions..
Edward's Volvo speeds along the two lane highway.
Bella glances at Edward, might ask him more questions but he seems to be wrestling with his own thoughts.
Finally..
BELLA I think I'm warm enough now.
She reaches for the heater dial, he does as well -- their hands TOUCH.
And hold a moment too long.
An electric current connecting them.
BELLA Your hand, it's still freezing cold.
He pulls his hand away, but she keeps looking at it...
then her attention shifts outside to FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS.
As they drive past the FORKS POLICE STATION, a sheriff's car pulls away.
Charlie's cruiser is parked out front.
BELLA Dad's here late.
BELLA Something must have happened.
The Volvo pulls up.
Bella and Edward climb out.
Edward then sees a second car next to the cruiser.
EDWARD That's my father's car.
EDWARD What's he --
In a pool of light, a distressed Charlie and Dr. Cullen study photographs and evidence.
As they wrap up their discussion, Dr. Cullen puts a sympathetic hand on Charlie's shoulder, then exits the police station looking grim.
EDWARD Carlisle.
EDWARD What happened?
DR. CULLEN Waylon Forge was found in the woods out near his place.
DR. CULLEN I just examined the body.
Edward darkens.
Bella is horrified.
BELLA He died?
BELLA How?
DR. CULLEN Animal attack.
BELLA The same kind that killed the security guard down in Mason?
Edward and Dr. Cullen trade a look, subtle, but Bella catches it.
DR. CULLEN Most likely.
BELLA So it's getting closer to town.
EDWARD Waylon lived all the way down on Queets River.
EDWARD 75 miles south.
BELLA But that's
DR. CULLEN (with a kind, reassuring
DR. CULLEN smile) Bella, you should go inside.
DR. CULLEN She goes to the door, but looks back to see them conferring quietly, gravely.
DR. CULLEN Clearly, there's more to this.
Bella enters to find a distressed Charlie studying evidence, photos, maps --trying to make sense of Waylon's death.
Deputies come and go in the background.
Bella approaches Charlie.
He looks up.
BELLA Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon.
CHARLIE Known him going on thirty years.
He's obviously torn up.
Bella isn't quite sure what to do.
And so puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.
A beat..
CHARLIE Then Charlie squeezes her hand.
CHARLIE It's the first physical affection we've seen between them.
CHARLIE And it threatens to evoke even more emotion in Charlie.
CHARLIE So he tamps it down, and rises, then projects a confident manner.
CHARLIE We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella.
CHARLIE But in the meantime..
CHARLIE As an ambulance pulls up outside, he opens a drawer, finds out a cannister of PEPPER SPRAY.
CHARLIE ...
CHARLIE I want you to have this.
BELLA That's probably not a good
CHARLIE It'll give me some peace of mind.
CHARLIE As Charlie goes to get his coat, Bella steps outside to SEE
Two Attendants hoist a metal gurney into an ambulance.
On it, Waylon's dead, white, bloody bare FEET peek out from under a sheet, resting at a disturbingly unnatural angle.
Off Bella, chilled..
FLASH POP TO THE FIVE CULLENS, SLOW MOTION, beautiful and white.
-- as she turns on the LIGHT.
She hears a SNAP!
outside the window.
She rises, digs into her purse for the PEPPER SPRAY Charlie gave her, and goes to the window.
She looks out -
CHARLIE all she sees is the wind blowing hard.
CHARLIE But she's rattled.
She closes the curtains, then reaches for the BOOK she bought earlier.
She thumbs through, laying the pepper spray within reach.
CHARLIE As she leafs through we see PHOTOS of ancient, carved MASKS.
CHARLIE Comical, menacing, haunting...
CHARLIE then she stops on a photo of a white mask with black eyes and a row of sharp teeth.
CHARLIE THE INSCRIPTION reads, ?The Cold One.
CHARLIE Bella quickly goes to her computer and Googles ?Cold One ? - several beer ads appear.
CHARLIE Frustrated, she closes the pop-ups, revealing a link to: ?The Cold One: Apotamkin? -
Several PICTURES begin loading: the seductive Apotamkin with his ice-blue skin, devouring his victims in tapestries, engravings, paintings.
Creatures beautiful and horrific.
Craven, skeletal demons attacking villages; perfectly sculpted predators, luring innocent maidens...
it's all murder, blood, sexuality.
THEN SEVERAL WORDS LEAP OUT in quick succession:
-- ?Speed.? ?Strength.? ?Cold skinned.? ?Immortal...
Then finally: ?Blood drinker.
CHARLIE And we LAND ON A PICTURE OF A HANDSOME MAN BITING A WOMAN'S
CHARLIE BACK ON BELLA - she reels back from the computer in utter disbelief.
BELLA ...
BELLA it's not possible..
BELLA Off BELLA'S FACE, struggling to make sense of it all..
She stands in the center of the deserted, green lawn.
Her expression tells us she's still reeling with disbelief.
STAY
The bell rings and students exit class, rushing past Bella as she stands still, waiting..
-- cross the lawn, heading to class.
Edward sees Bella, sees the intensity on her face.
He stops.
She walks to him, eyes meeting his...
her look says, we have to talk...
and she continues directly past him, into the dark forest that borders the school.
He watches her disappear in the trees, then takes a step to follow.
Jasper moves in front of him, Rosalie grabs his arm.
ROSALIE Edward, don't go.
ROSALIE But Alice gently removes Rosalie's hand from his arm.
ALICE He's already there.
Bella stands amid the trees, waiting.
Then the SOUNDS OF THE FOREST abruptly drop out.
A predator is near.
Edward appears behind her.
She doesn't turn around.
A beat.
BELLA You're impossibly fast.
BELLA And strong.
BELLA Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold.
BELLA Your eyes change color.
BELLA And sometimes you speak like...
BELLA you're from a different time.
BELLA You never eat food, or drink, or come out in the sunlight.
BELLA And you said no to the beach trip only after you heard where it was.
BELLA Because of the treaty.
This last registers with him.
She steps closer to him.
BELLA How old are you?
EDWARD Seventeen.
BELLA How long have you been seventeen?
A long beat as we begin to CIRCLE THEM.
He sees he can't hide anymore.
Honesty is an enormous risk, but he has to take it.
EDWARD ...
EDWARD A while.
She inhales.
She knew, but it's still shocking.
We CIRCLE
BELLA I know what the Cold Ones are.
BELLA What you are.
EDWARD Say it.
EDWARD Out loud.
EDWARD Say it.
All sound suddenly DROPS OUT.
We hear only her whisper..
BELLA ...
BELLA Vampire
They seem to hover in momentary stasis, him utterly exposed, her reality utterly rocked.
EDWARD Are you afraid?
BELLA No.
EDWARD Then ask me the most basic question: what do we eat?
BELLA You won't hurt me.
BELLA You're different.
EDWARD You think you know me?
He glares at her.
She holds her ground.
Suddenly, he takes her by the hand.
Starts walking.
BELLA Where are we going?
EDWARD Up the mountain.
EDWARD Out of the cloud bank.
EDWARD You need to see what
EDWARD really am.
EDWARD What I look like in the harsh light of the sun.
BELLA No!
BELLA The sunlight will kill you.
EDWARD Myth.
EDWARD You need to see the truth.
He pulls her but she stumbles.
BELLA Slow down.
Suddenly, he's right next to her.
EDWARD Are you afraid?
BELLA No.
EDWARD Then come with me.
EDWARD Someplace where no one can protect you.
EDWARD Where
EDWARD could do what I've wanted to do from the first moment I met you.
Their proximity is intense, riveting both of them.
BELLA I'm not afraid.
EDWARD You should be.
He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into his arms.
EDWARD Hold on.
As in the opening sequence, Edward races through the forest, dark trunks STROBING past as he picks up speed, faster and faster.
Bella clings to his back as it seems he'll collide with the trees, but he avoids them with supernatural grace.
It's frightening, nauseating, intoxicating.
EDWARD Are you afraid!
BELLA No!
But she clings tighter.
Terrified.
They climb in altitude.
Higher and higher, above the fog layer.
Finally, up ahead
BELLA THE FOREST'S EDGE fast approaches, a clearing is beyond.
BELLA The sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees...
BELLA they're about to emerge from the shadowy darkness...
BELLA but suddenly-
Bella finds herself sitting on the ground, against a tree.
All is silent.
She's dizzy, tries to regain her equilibrium.
Then she realizes she's alone.
BELLA Edward?
BELLA Where are you?
She rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into
A perfect circle of swaying grass, wildflowers and buttery sunlight.
HEAR a stream nearby.
Bella looks around and finally sees
EDWARD, his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some trees.
He watches her cautiously.
She takes a step toward him, but he holds up a hand.
She waits.
Finally, he takes a deep breath, and steps out of the shade
EDWARD This is why we don't show ourselves
in sunlight..
EDWARD As the sun hits him...
EDWARD EDWARD'S SKIN literally sparkles as if embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds.
EDWARD He is magnificent, shimmering, like a statue carved from glittering crystal.
EDWARD He moves toward her.
EDWARD This is what I am.
He nears, clearly expecting her to recoil, but..
BELLA You're...
BELLA beautiful..
BELLA He realizes that she's in awe.
BELLA She reaches to touch him, but he immediately backs into the shadows, his skin normal again.
EDWARD Beautiful?
EDWARD I'm a killer, Bella.
EDWARD This is the skin of a killer.
His arm juts into A SHAFT OF LIGHT, sparkling again.
BELLA I don't believe that.
EDWARD Because you believe the lie.
EDWARD The camouflage.
EDWARD I'm the world's most dangerous predator.
EDWARD Everything about me invites you in - my voice, my face, even my smell.
EDWARD As if
EDWARD need any of that..
EDWARD He's suddenly BEHIND her --then IN FRONT of her --then by a tree, DARTING so fast, we only see where he lands
EDWARD As if you could outrun me.
EDWARD As if you could fight me off.
EDWARD Bella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable.
EDWARD I'm designed to kill.
BELLA I don't care.
EDWARD I've killed people.
BELLA It doesn't matter.
EDWARD I wanted to kill you.
EDWARD I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life.
EDWARD I'm dangerous to you.
BELLA I trust you.
EDWARD Don't.
BELLA I trust you, Edward.
BELLA I'm here.
She takes his hand.
He reels at the warmth of her touch.
She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her THROAT is nearing his lips...
then suddenly he's gone.
BELLA Edward?
She looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow, catching his breath.
EDWARD You...
EDWARD took me by surprise.
EDWARD I don't know how to...
EDWARD do this.
He moves back toward her.
Slowly.
EDWARD Me, and my family, we're different from others of our kind.
EDWARD We're not nomadic, we have a permanent home.
EDWARD We only hunt animals.
EDWARD We've learned to control our thirst..
EDWARD But you - your scent, it's like a drug to me...
EDWARD my own personal brand of heroin.
BELLA Oh...
BELLA I thought you hated me when we met.
EDWARD I did.
EDWARD For making me want you so badly.
EDWARD I'm still not sure I can control myself.
He reaches her again.
BELLA I know you can.
He's utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her face for clues.
EDWARD I wish I could understand this thing you see in me.
EDWARD You look at me with those eyes..
EDWARD I can't read your mind.
EDWARD Tell me what you're thinking.
BELLA I'm afraid.
Stricken, he sinks gracefully to his knees in the grass.
EDWARD Good.
She sinks down in front of him.
BELLA Not of that.
BELLA I'm afraid...
BELLA you'll disappear.
BELLA That I'll lose you.
EDWARD You don't know how long I've looked for you.
They share a smile.
Then he reaches toward her neck, pausing..
EDWARD Be very still.
She does so.
Exercising great control, he places his hand on her throat...
it's so exposed, so vulnerable.
The rush between them is overwhelming.
But Bella doesn't move.
EDWARD He brushes his hand up her cheek.
EDWARD Then lowers it to her heart...
EDWARD Clouds float past the sun..
EDWARD They're both overwhelmed, taking each other in.
EDWARD And so the lion fell for the lamb.
BELLA Stupid lamb.
EDWARD Sick masochistic lion.
CRANE UP on the two of them, laying together, as close as they dare...
his hand to her heart..
CLOSE ON BELLA'S FACE.
Still in bed.
Thinking.
EDWARD About three things I was absolutely positive.
EDWARD One, Edward was a vampire.
She rises, goes to the mirror.
Looks at herself, worry knitting her brow.
EDWARD Two, there was a part of him that thirsted for my blood.
EDWARD And three..
EDWARD As she moves past her window, something catches her eye, causing her to BANG into her desk.
EDWARD She looks back out..
Edward leans against his car, looking up at her with a small smile.
She beams at the sight of him.
EDWARD ...
EDWARD I was falling, unconditionally and irrevocably, in love with him.
Edward helps Bella balance-walk across an enormous fallen pine tree in the moss-covered forest.
BELLA How long have you been like this?
EDWARD Since nineteen-eighteen.
EDWARD That's when Carlisle found me.
She takes that in, it's a lot.
But it stokes her curiosity.
BELLA Where'd he find you?
EDWARD In a hospital, dying of Spanish influenza.
EDWARD My parents had already died.
FLASHBACK to CHICAGO HOSPITAL, 1918 - NIGHT
EDWARD What was it like?
EDWARD The word excruciating comes to mind.
EDWARD But what Carlisle did was much harder...
EDWARD not many of us have the restraint to do that.
EDWARD Didn't he just...
EDWARD bite?
EDWARD Not just.
EDWARD Our bite contains venom.
EDWARD And once we taste blood, a sort of..
EDWARD frenzy begins.
EDWARD It's almost impossible to stop.
EDWARD But Carlisle did.
EDWARD First with me, then with his wife, Esme.
EDWARD He found her in a hospital, as well.
EDWARD The others followed.
BACK to PRESENT DAY
BELLA Does someone have to be dying to become like you?..
BELLA Their CONVERSATION CONTINUES as we go to
They walk along a stunning coastline -- rugged black rocks, covered in bright green moss.
EDWARD ...
EDWARD No, that's just Carlisle.
EDWARD He would never do...
EDWARD this, to someone who had another choice.
BELLA So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people.
EDWARD Not the only reason.
He stops, looks down at her, serious, with emotion..
EDWARD I don't want to be a monster.
She nods.
Understands.
He smiles.
EDWARD We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way...
EDWARD For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu.
EDWARD It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying.
Then abruptly, he whips past Bella.
She turns to see him standing on a large rock in the river.
BELLA Show off.
EDWARD It's not that impressive, really.
EDWARD Anyone in my family can do this.
BELLA Can they all read minds, too?
EDWARD No, that's unique to me.
EDWARD But Alice can see the future.
BELLA Really?
BELLA Bet she saw me coming a mile away.
She notes his change of mood as he slows, darkening.
EDWARD Her visions are very subjective.
EDWARD The future can change.
He cuts off her questions by returning to shore, and continuing their walk..
Water sprays from a hose as Bella and Edward wash her truck.
A boom box PLAYS.
He perches on top of the roof.
EDWARD Come to my house tomorrow.
Bella looks up, aiming the hose badly - water ricochets off the cab and sprays in her face.
He jumps down from the roof.
BELLA Your house?
BELLA With your family?
He wipes down the dented front fender, then reaches under it and, with his bare hands, easily pops a large DENT out of the truck's body.
She's too flustered to register it.
BELLA But...
BELLA what if they don't like me?
EDWARD You're worried, not because you'll be in a houseful of vampires, but because you think they won't approve of you?
BELLA I'm glad I amuse you.
But then his laughter dies, as he hears something.
BELLA What is it?
EDWARD A complication.
...
as a BLACK CAR comes into view, and pulls up.
EDWARD I'll pick you up tomorrow.
He heads to his car, eying the passengers in
Jacob, with his father, Billy, who's expression is intense.
Anxious.
SLOW MOTION as Edward locks eyes with Billy.
Jacob looks questioningly at his father.
Bella watches Edward drive away, perturbed by the exchange.
She forces a smile and goes to greet the visitors.
Jacob sets up Billy's wheelchair and Billy climbs into it as
BELLA Come to visit your truck?
JACOB Looks good.
JACOB You got that dent out.
BILLY Actually, we came to visit your flat screen.
BILLY First Mariners game of the season.
BILLY Plus Jacob here kept bugging me to see you again.
JACOB Great, Dad.
JACOB Thanks.
Jacob shoots his father an irritated look, just as the POLICE CRUISER pulls up.
Charlie climbs out, holding two six-packs.
CHARLIE Pale Ale.
BILLY (holds up a brown paper
Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.
Charlie smiles, pleased.
He clicks on the game as they all head inside
BILLY Any luck with the Waylon case?
CHARLIE Found a footprint out at the crime scene today.
CHARLIE A bare, human footprint.
Billy seems disturbed but not surprised.
Bella is horrified.
BELLA A person did that?
JACOB A crazy person, walking around barefoot this time of year.
CHARLIE Spread the word out at the rez, will ya?
CHARLIE Keep the kids out of the woods.
BILLY Will do.
BILLY Don't want no one else getting hurt.
Bella floats near Edward, only their hands touching, but their bodies are nearing, so close, so sensual..
Suddenly, EDWARD IS YANKED DOWNWARD!
Something has him, pulling him down..
-- as her eyes pop open...
and relief sweeps over her as she realizes it was just a dream.
But it haunts her..
AERIAL SHOT of the forest as we sweep over its lush green expanse, to FIND Edward's Volvo speeding along, very fast.
The Volvo finally turns off the paved highway and onto a long
serpentine dirt road.
FOLLOW THE CAR until, finally, it reaches a small meadow, in the center of which sits
A timeless graceful house.
The Volvo pulls up and Bella climbs out, surprised.
BELLA It's...
BELLA wonderful.
EDWARD You expected turrets, dungeons and moats?
BELLA No...
BELLA not moats.
BELLA He takes her hand.
BELLA She girds herself.
BELLA They head inside.
Edward guides Bella into the large, bright house.
Walls of glass look out on the river.
Everything's open and white.
Historical objects are tastefully placed throughout.
HEAR Verdi's ?La Traviata: Libiamo ne' lieti calici? coming from another room.
Bella is enraptured.
BELLA It's so light and open.
EDWARD Thanks to tinted windows...
EDWARD It's the one place we never have to hide.
We then notice CLANGING coming from the kitchen.
Edward shakes his head.
EDWARD I told them not to do this.
Verdi's opera BLASTS Bella and Edward who enter to find the kitchen in full swing.
Dr. Cullen, Emmett, Rosalie, and ESME prepare elaborate platters of Italian pastas and antipasti.
Esme rolls out a pizza dough and fans tomatoes around it in an instant.
Rosalie stirs a pot, disinterested.
Esme sees Bella and stops, emanating maternal warmth.
Her heart-shaped face and billows of hair are reminiscent of the silent-movie era.
ESME Bella.
ESME We're making Italiano for
you.
EDWARD This is Esme, my mother for all
intents and purposes.
BELLA Bon giorno?
ESME Molto bene!
DR. CULLEN You've given us an excuse to use
DR. CULLEN Hit pause..
DR. CULLEN PAN across brand new Williams-Sonoma cookware boxes to the corner --they're watching an ITALIAN COOKING SHOW on a TV.
DR. CULLEN Emmett hits the DVD remote control.
ESME I hope you're hungry.
BELLA Oh, absolutely
EDWARD She already ate.
Bella shoots him a look, but something SHATTERS.
Rosalie has thrown down a bowl and now strides out
ROSALIE Perfect.
-- Bella exits behind Rosalie, trying to explain.
The other's follow -
BELLA I just assumed -- because you don't eat, you know..
ESME Of course.
ESME That was very considerate of you.
EDWARD Ignore her.
EDWARD I do.
ROSALIE Yes, let's keep pretending this isn't dangerous for all of us.
BELLA I would never, ever tell anyone.
DR. CULLEN She knows that.
EMMETT The problem is, you two have gone public now, so..
ESME Emmett.
ROSALIE No, she should know.
ROSALIE The entire family will be implicated if this ends badly.
BELLA ...
BELLA Badly?
This hangs in the air, uncomfortably.
Edward can't look at her.
BELLA Oh.
BELLA Badly.
BELLA Like, where I become a meal.
BELLA Rosalie, exasperated, heads back into the kitchen.
BELLA Emmett shrugs, goes after her.
BELLA Hi, Bella!
ON THE BALCONY Alice leaps over the rail, holding a bouquet of wildflowers.
Jasper follows her.
She bounces forward to kiss Bella's cheek and hands Bella the wildflowers.
ALICE I'm Alice.
ALICE You do smell good.
EDWARD Alice.
ALICE It's alright, Bella and I are going to be great friends.
BELLA And you're Jasper, right?
JASPER Pleasure to meet you.
But he shies away from her hand.
ALICE You won't hurt her, Jasper.
He isn't so sure.
Edward takes Bella's hand instead.
EDWARD I'll give you a tour of the house.
ALICE I'll see you soon.
Edward shoots Alice a look, which Bella catches before he guides her up the stairs.
As they ascend, Bella takes in the eclectic ART PIECES from around the world, Ethiopian crosses, Dresden China, Asian scrolls.
They reach
ALICE THE LANDING - to FIND a wall of dozens of artistically arrayed silk squares with tassels.
ALICE Bella looks closer.
BELLA Graduation caps?
EDWARD A private joke.
EDWARD We matriculate a lot.
BELLA What a nightmare, repeating high school.
EDWARD True, but the younger we start out in a new place, the longer we can stay there.
She shivers at the thought of it, as they continue on..
EDWARD ...
EDWARD and this is my room.
Bella enters to find a wall of glass doors open to a deck, with the river beyond.
The rest is floor to ceiling CD's, vinyl,
EDWARD track tapes, etc., with a sophisticated I-pod/stereo set up.
BELLA So you're obsessed with music.
BELLA But..
BELLA No bed?
EDWARD No sleep.
BELLA Ever?
EDWARD No nightmares, no drool, no snoring.
She considers this, as she runs a hand along a wall of CD's, studying the titles.
EDWARD Do you have any favorites?
BELLA Depends.
BELLA Alternative?
BELLA Jazz?
BELLA Sixties, seventies..
EDWARD Ooh, she knows her music.
EDWARD Alright, nineties.
EDWARD Eighteen-nineties.
EDWARD Classical.
BELLA I'd have to say...
BELLA Debussy.
He looks at her, surprised, smiles.
EDWARD My favorite, too.
Off their connection, he pulls out a CD and puts it on.
EDWARD solo piano version of CLAIR DE LUNE begins to play.
He moves to her, taking her hand, then he starts to turn her in a pirouette, dancing with her - but she breaks off and backs away.
BELLA No dancing.
EDWARD Ever?
BELLA No tripping, no falling, no derision.
EDWARD I can always make you.
BELLA You don't scare me.
EDWARD You really shouldn't have said that.
He grins, a low GROWLING SOUNDS in the back of his throat.
She laughs and backs out the door, onto
-- Bella backs up to the rail.
Edward appears in the doorway, shifting into a half-crouch, about to pounce.
BELLA Don't you dare -
Suddenly, she's airborne as he tackles her and they FLY OFF THE DECK...
then she finds herself
BELLA IN A TREE - in his arms.
BELLA When she realizes where she is, she laughs, delighted.
BELLA It's infectious, he laughs heartily, too..
Esme and Dr. Cullen look out the window.
Edward's LAUGHTER filters inside to them; Esme, in turn, smiles.
ESME She's brought him to life.
DR. CULLEN He's been alone too long...
DR. CULLEN but how can it end well?
ESME Alice has been wrong before.
DR. CULLEN Not often.
Esme turns to Dr. Cullen, gentle but absolutely firm.
ESME Carlisle.
ESME Bella is what he wants.
ESME Dr. Cullen smiles at her with love, then takes her hand as they look back out the window..
Edward looks Bella in the eye.
EDWARD Trust me?
BELLA In theory.
EDWARD Then close your eyes.
She does, warily.
He grips her more firmly, then LEAPS them to another tree like a flying squirrel!
Then, again, to the TOP of another tree.
He easily gets a foothold, while holding Bella.
EDWARD Open.
She does...
to the most astonishing bird's eye VIEW of the valley, river, and the mountains beyond.
CAMERA whirls around them allowing us a 360 degree view of their surroundings.
Off Bella's intoxicated face..
Jessica pops a volleyball in the air, doing practice serves.
Angela takes a picture of her, then points her camera around, looking for another shot.
Eric studies some fliers advertising the prom.
JESSICA Monte Carlo?
JESSICA That's our prom
theme?
ERIC Gambling, tuxedos and -
ERIC Bond.
ERIC James -- ow!
-- as Jessica head-butts the ball which hits him in the face.
Oh.
My.
God.
Angela, scanning for a shot, has frozen.
Jessica and Eric
-- arriving together.
All eyes on campus are turning to them, filled with curiosity, jealousy, envy.
BELLA Everyone's staring.
EDWARD Not that guy over -- yeah, he just looked.
EDWARD Off his rakish, but reassuring smile..
Moving fast, tracking.
INCLUDE CHARLIE holding the leash
--It's a hunting party, several dogs, half a dozen armed men.
CHARLIE Guys, we got something
CHARLIE The Deputies hurry to Charlie.
CHARLIE They gather around
CHARLIE A FOOTPRINT.
CHARLIE The dogs start pulling them in a certain direction.
CHARLIE As the posse takes off at a sprint
We watch Charlie and the posse move away...
REVERSE to find
Laurent stands next to him.
Victoria jogs up.
VICTORIA They took the bait.
JAMES By tomorrow they'll be half way to Winnipeg.
Victoria lasciviously grabs James' shirt.
Pulls him to her.
VICTORIA I love when men chase me.
He grins, then starts taking off her clothes.
They pull each other toward the woods with carnal lust.
It barely registers with Laurent, who continues to watch the posse with concern.
Bella hurries toward the entrance, trying to keep the joy on her face in check...
with minimal success.
Outside the door, she passes Mike, hanging out with several of his basketball TEAMMATES.
MIKE Yo, Arizona.
MIKE So.
MIKE You and Cullen.
She shrugs, non-committal, but can't entirely hide a smile, as she hurries inside to Charlie's table and slides in.
BELLA Sorry I'm late.
BELLA Biology project.
Cora sets a top sirloin steak in front of Charlie, and plate of seafood in front of Bella.
CHARLIE Ordered you the seafood combo.
BELLA Order one for yourself next time.
BELLA You should cut back on the steak.
CHARLIE I'm healthy as a horse.
CORA Say Chief, boys want to know, you find anything down by Queets River today?
Charlie's aware of the LOGGERS at the counter listening, too.
He frames his answer carefully to keep everyone calm.
CHARLIE The suspect's moving east.
CHARLIE Kitsap County Sheriff is taking over from here.
CHARLIE They're putting extra guys on.
CORA Hope they catch him fast.
She moves off, with a measure of relief.
Charlie and Bella pass each other the salt, butter for bread, etc., with an easy rhythm now.
CHARLIE Your friends are flagging you.
She turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around outside, straws in their noses, making faces at her.
She smiles.
CHARLIE It's okay you wanna join them.
CHARLIE I'm just gonna turn in early anyway.
BELLA Yeah, me, too.
CHARLIE It's a Friday night.
CHARLIE Go out.
CHARLIE The Newton boy's got a big smile for you.
CHARLIE Nice family, the Newtons.
BELLA He's just a friend.
CHARLIE None of the boys in town interest you?
BELLA We're not really going to talk about boys, are we?
CHARLIE Just...
CHARLIE you should be around people.
CHARLIE I leave you alone too much.
BELLA I've never minded being alone.
BELLA Guess I'm a lot like my dad that way.
Charlie smiles.
These two have come a long way.
Cora returns
CORA Berry cobbler, two forks.
She sets it between them.
Off them, both reaching for forks..
Bella, dressed for bed, looks out the window as she talks on the phone with Rene.
Bella's euphoria still lingers in her eyes..
BELLA So spring training's going well?
Rene talks on her cell.
Phil is in the background, post-batting practice, chowing down with a couple of teammates.
RENE Phil's working hard.
RENE We're looking around for a house to rent, in case it becomes permanent.
RENE You'd like Jacksonville, baby.
BELLA Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me.
RENE (stops, knows there's
more) Could...
a guy have something to do with that?
BELLA Maybe..
RENE Tell me everything!
RENE Jock?
RENE Indie?
RENE Bet he's smart.
RENE Is he smart?
BELLA Well...
BELLA he is kind of a history buff.
-- this as she turns to find
BELLA EDWARD LYING ON HER BED, smiling.
BELLA She nearly drops the phone.
BELLA I, uh...
BELLA have to go.
RENE No way, we gotta talk boys.
RENE Are you being safe?
Edward shoots her a look, he heard that.
She's mortified.
BELLA I'll call you later, Mom.
STAY ON BELLA who hangs up.
BELLA How did you get in here?
EDWARD The window.
EDWARD As always.
BELLA You've been here before?
EDWARD What else is there to do at night?
She pushes him.
He grabs her hand and playfully pulls her onto the bed, wrestling as
BELLA You're a peeping Tom!
BELLA Perv!
EDWARD Shh!
EDWARD The Chief will hear you!
But the electricity of their physical contact quickly overwhelms them, their laughter quieting.
He studies her face.
EDWARD I just...
EDWARD like watching over you.
He raises his fingers to her lips, sending a thrill up her spine.
EDWARD There's something I'd like to try.
She nods, bedazzled by him.
He takes her face in his hands, hesitates to test himself, then he softly kisses her..
EDWARD What neither of them is prepared for is her response.
EDWARD Her breath comes in a wild GASP.
EDWARD Her fingers knot in his hair, clutching him to her.
EDWARD Lips part as she breathes his scent..
EDWARD Then his hands gently, but forcefully push her face back.
EDWARD She opens her eyes to see that his eyes are wild, his jaw clenched.
BELLA Oh...
BELLA I'm...
BELLA oh.
He relaxes slightly, looking at her blushing face.
EDWARD I'm stronger than I thought.
BELLA Wish I could say the same.
BELLA I'm so embarrassed.
EDWARD Don't be.
EDWARD But we have to be careful.
EDWARD I can never lose control with you.
EDWARD Ever.
She nods, then carefully lies on his chest.
He wraps his arms around her.
Off the two of them..
Bella enters to find Charlie cleaning a rifle.
He starts to say hello but she just blurts out -
BELLA I have a date with Edward Cullen.
He suddenly looks like he's having an aneurysm.
CHARLIE He's too old for you.
BELLA We're both juniors.
BELLA I thought you liked the Cullens.
CHARLIE And I thought you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.
BELLA Edward doesn't live ?in town.? And it's in the early stage and -
BELLA whatever, he's outside right now.
CHARLIE Now?
CHARLIE He's out there?
BELLA He wants to meet you.
BELLA Officially.
CHARLIE Good.
He cocks the rifle in mock-seriousness.
BELLA Be nice, okay?
BELLA He's...
BELLA important.
Charlie gives his daughter a reassuring nod...
then she opens the door to REVEAL Edward in a parka and gloves.
EDWARD Chief Swan.
EDWARD I wanted to formally introduce myself.
EDWARD I'm Edward.
Edward extends his hand.
Charlie takes it, but grunts a hello, resisting him.
EDWARD I won't keep Bella out late tonight.
EDWARD We're just going to go play baseball with my family.
CHARLIE Bella's going to play baseball?
Bella's equally surprised, but hides it.
EDWARD Yes, sir, that's the plan.
CHARLIE Well.
CHARLIE More power to you, I guess.
EDWARD She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise.
As Edward exits...
Charlie holds Bella back.
CHARLIE You got that pepper spray?
BELLA Dad.
Edward and Bella climb into a massive JEEP parked in the drive.
EDWARD Your father thinks you should go to an all-girl's school.
BELLA No fair, reading Charlie's mind.
As they climb in the Jeep, Bella notices a baseball bat
BELLA And since when do vampires like baseball?
EDWARD It's the American pastime.
EDWARD Plus, there's a thunderstorm coming.
EDWARD It's the only time we can play.
EDWARD You'll see why.
Storm clouds gather in the sky as Bella and Edward pull up in the Jeep.
She takes in a rough baseball diamond, set into an enormous field in the lap of the Olympic peaks.
Esme and Emmett come to greet Bella.
ESME Good thing you're here.
ESME We need a umpire.
EMMETT She thinks we cheat.
ESME I know you cheat.
ESME Call ?em as you see ?em, Bella.
WHIP PAN to Alice on the Pitcher's Mound.
ALICE It's time.
-- Just as a deep RUMBLE of thunder shakes the forest.
And it's extraordinary.
Bella stays by Esme who plays catcher.
Alice pitches with lightning-fast speed.
Edward and Emmett take positions in the outfield.
-- ROSALIE SMASHES the ball with the aluminum bat.
It CRACKS like thunder -- and is followed directly by real THUNDER.
BELLA Now I get why you need the thunder.
The ball SHOOTS like a meteor deep into the forest, rocketing through the trees.
Edward disappears after it.
BELLA That has to be a home run.
ESME Edward's very fast.
Rosalie darts around the bases, almost a blur -- Edward races out of the forest with the ball and WHIPS it to home plate.
WHAP!
Esme catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in.
BELLA Yer out?
Esme nods...
Amazed, Bella watches as DR.
CULLEN hits a line drive.
Edward and Emmett race for the catch, DIVING 15 feet and COLLIDING with such might that it sounds like enormous boulders falling.
They miss the ball -- Dr. Cullen is safe!
BELLA JASPER WHACKS the next pitch -- deep into the forest.
BELLA But before Edward can chase it, Alice suddenly GASPS.
ALICE Stop!
ALICE I didn't see them..
ALICE They all stop.
ALICE Edward is immediately at Bella's side.
ALICE The family instantly gathers at home plate.
ALICE They're traveling so quickly
ROSALIE You said they left the county -
ALICE They did, but then they heard us..
ALICE And changed their minds.
EDWARD Put your hair down
ROSALIE Like that'll help.
ROSALIE I could smell her from across the field.
Edward ignores Rosalie as he arranges Bella's hair.
EDWARD I shouldn't have brought you here.
EDWARD I'm so sorry.
She'd ask why, but suddenly, they all turn as one toward -
There's a faint rustle...
then James, Victoria and Laurent emerge.
As they near, Bella SEES their bare feet, then the deep BURGUNDY of their eyes.
Laurent holds up the baseball.
LAURENT I believe this belongs to you.
He tosses the ball (his casual toss is still blindingly fast) to Dr. Cullen who easily catches it and smiles politely.
DR. CULLEN Thank you.
LAURENT Could you use three more players?
DR. CULLEN Of course.
LAURENT I'm Laurent.
LAURENT This is Victoria.
LAURENT And James.
DR. CULLEN Would you like to bat first?
Laurent picks up a bat.
The Cullens take the field.
Dr.
Cullen is catcher, Edward is on first, with Bella behind him, near the Jeep.
Bella sees that Edward's eyes are locked onto James.
Laurent is at bat first.
DR. CULLEN I'm afraid your hunting activities have caused something of a mess for us.
LAURENT Our apologies.
LAURENT We didn't realize the territory had been claimed.
DR. CULLEN Yes, we maintain a permanent residence.
The three newcomers exchange a look of surprise.
LAURENT Really?
LAURENT Well, we won't be a problem any more.
VICTORIA The humans were tracking us, but we led them East-
VICTORIA James is up next and he POWER-SLAMS IT with AMAZING FORCE..
VICTORIA He runs past first, past Edward, past Bella..
VICTORIA CLOSE ON BELLA -- IN SLOW MOTION as the wind from the ball ruffles her hair, carrying her scent, which floats to
VICTORIA JAMES -- who suddenly SCREECHES to a halt.
VICTORIA His head WHIPS around at her and he lurches into a crouch, his nostrils flaring, excitedly, eyes locked on Bella.
JAMES You brought a snack.
JAMES OVERHEAD SHOT: in a flash, the Cullens rush into position behind Edward -- Laurent and Victoria line up behind James.
DR. CULLEN The girl is with us.
LAURENT We won't harm her.
EMMETT Just try it.
DR. CULLEN I think it best if you leave.
LAURENT Yes, I can see the game is over.
LAURENT We'll go now.
LAURENT James?
But James' eyes don't leave Edward's.
Laurent puts a hand on James' shoulder, and finally, James backs into the woods with his cohorts, disappearing.
Once they're gone, Esme immediately gathers up the bats-
DR. CULLEN Get Bella out of here.
DR. CULLEN We'll follow them.
Dr. Cullen, Jasper and a resentful Rosalie race off after the three vampires.
Edward scoops Bella up as we
Edward whips Bella into the Jeep and straps her in -
EDWARD James is a tracker.
EDWARD I saw his mind.
EDWARD The hunt is his obsession, and my reaction set him off -
EDWARD -- The tires spin as Edward WHIPS the jeep around
EDWARD -- We're a large clan of strong fighters all protecting one vulnerable human.
EDWARD I just made this his most exciting game ever.
Bella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just wrought up on them all as..
A jolting, death defying ride, SPLASHING through creeks, until they reach
THE JEEP speeds wildly down the road.
EDWARD The first place he'll go is your house.
EDWARD He'll track your scent there.
BELLA What?!?
BELLA Charlie's there.
BELLA He's in danger because of me.
BELLA Because of us!
EDWARD Then we'll lead the tracker away from him.
EDWARD Somehow.
He angrily WHIPS around a bend, MUD FLYING
Charlie watches a baseball game on T.V. as the door suddenly BURSTS open to reveal Bella, crying, and Edward, devastated-
BELLA I said, leave me alone!
EDWARD Bella, don't do this.
EDWARD Just think about it, please
BELLA Get out!
BELLA It's over.
She SLAMS the door.
Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned.
CHARLIE Bella?
CHARLIE What happened?
BELLA I have to get out of this place.
BELLA Out of Forks.
BELLA I'm leaving.
BELLA Now.
Bella runs upstairs.
Charlie hurries after her
Bella slams the door behind her.
REVEAL Edward's already there, pulling things from her drawers and shoving them into a duffle faster than humanly possible.
Bella leans against the door.
BELLA I can't hurt him.
BELLA Edward gives her a look, you have to.
BELLA INTERCUT Charlie on the other side.
BELLA It's agony for both of them.
CHARLIE Bells.
CHARLIE Did he hurt you?
BELLA No, Dad.
CHARLIE Then what?
CHARLIE Did he break up with you?
BELLA I broke up with him.
CHARLIE I thought you liked him?
BELLA That's why I have to leave.
BELLA I don't want this.
BELLA I want to go home.
EDWARD I'll be in the truck.
And he disappears out the window.
Bella gathers strength to continue her performance.
She opens the door to reveal Charlie.
He follows as she carries her duffle and truck keys into
Bella charges down the stairs -- Charlie follows.
CHARLIE Your mother's not even in Phoenix.
BELLA She'll come home.
BELLA I'll call her from the road.
CHARLIE You can't drive home now.
CHARLIE I'll take you to the airport in the morning.
BELLA I want to drive.
BELLA I need time to think.
BELLA I'll pull into a motel in a few hours.
BELLA I promise.
She heads down the stairs.
Charlie follows..
Bella reaches the ground floor with Charlie on her heels.
She's almost to the door but Charlie blocks her.
CHARLIE Bells, I know I'm not around much,
CHARLIE but I can change that.
CHARLIE more things together.
She takes a breath, hating herself for what she's about to say..
BELLA Like watch more baseball on the flat
BELLA Same people, same steak, same berry
BELLA Dad.
BELLA Not me.
This hits Charlie hard.
She can barely stand it, heads down the stairs, as he takes a second to recover..
CHARLIE Bella...
CHARLIE I just got you back.
Which breaks Bella's heart...
and forces her to deliver the final blow.
BELLA And if I don't get out now, I'm
BELLA Charlie is stunned, wounded.
BELLA She takes advantage of his shock, pushing past him out the door.
Bella exits, heads to her truck.
Fresh tears spring to her eyes.
Trees, branches...
and a pair of DEADLY EYES.
James.
He watches from a distance as Bella pulls out.
The truck moves off...
and so does James, leaving Charlie alone with his pain, staring out the window.
Bella drives, wiping tears away.
Suddenly Edward is outside the car, near Bella's window.
EDWARD He'll forgive you.
EDWARD Slide over..
EDWARD Bella slides over to the passenger side as Edward opens the door, sliding in, and takes the wheel.
EDWARD Bella slumps.
BELLA His face...
BELLA I said the same words my mother used when she left him.
EDWARD It was the only way he'd let you go.
Edward FLOORS it.
EDWARD Your father's safe now, Bella.
EDWARD The tracker is following us
EDWARD Suddenly, BOOM!
EDWARD - a dark figure LEAPS onto the bed of the truck.
EDWARD Bella SCREAMS.
EDWARD It's alright.
EDWARD It's just Emmett.
EDWARD Alice is in the car behind us.
She catches her breath.
It kills him to see her so frightened.
She looks out the window as they drive through town..
The small, insulated town passes by in SLOW MOTION...
INSIDE we SEE Mike, Jessica, Eric and Angela laughing, flirting, innocent, hopeful..
Edward, Emmett and Alice rush Bella from the truck to the house...
but freeze when the door opens and Laurent exits.
They immediately take defensive positions but Dr. Cullen appears.
DR. CULLEN He came to warn us.
DR. CULLEN About James.
They back down slightly.
Laurent address Dr. Cullen.
LAURENT I've grown tired of his games.
LAURENT But he's got unparalleled senses.
LAURENT Absolutely lethal.
LAURENT I've never seen anything like him in three hundred years ...
LAURENT And the woman, Victoria, will back him.
LAURENT Don't underestimate her.
Dr. Cullen nods thanks.
Laurent looks at Edward, apologetic.
LAURENT I'm truly sorry for what's been unleashed here.
And he moves off, disappearing into the woods..
The side door BURSTS OPEN as Edward and the Cullens enter, followed by Bella.
The lights flip on to reveal a pristine garage; the Volvo, the red BMW, a black Mercedes sedan, an SUV.
Everyone but Rosalie springs into action, opening cupboards for supplies - cell phones, extra batteries, maps, portable GPS units, changes of clothes, cans of gasoline, etc.
As they load up the vehicles
JASPER I've had to fight our kind before.
JASPER We're hard to kill.
EDWARD But not impossible.
EDWARD We'll tear him up
EMMETT We'll rip him apart with our hands, then burn the pieces
DR. CULLEN I don't relish killing another creature.
DR. CULLEN Even a sadistic one like James.
ROSALIE If he doesn't get to one of us first.
BELLA This is insane.
BELLA You can't put yourselves in danger like this - for me.
ROSALIE Too late.
Edward shoots Rosalie a look, but he grabs two sets of keys off a hook, throwing one set, lightning fast, to Dr. Cullen
EDWARD I'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker away
DR. CULLEN No, Edward -- the tracker thinks you won't leave Bella.
DR. CULLEN He'll follow you.
ALICE I'll go with Bella.
ALICE Jasper and
ALICE will drive her south.
ALICE I'll keep her safe, Edward.
Edward agonizes.
Frustrated.
Alice steps forward.
EDWARD Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
She nods.
An unspoken agreement.
Edward finally surrenders his keys to Alice.
Then he opens one of Bella's suitcases, pulling out clothes, tossing them to
EDWARD Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent.
ROSALIE Why should I?
ROSALIE What is she to me?
ROSALIE Just a danger you've inflicted on us
DR. CULLEN Rosalie.
DR. CULLEN Bella is with Edward.
DR. CULLEN She's a part of this family now.
DR. CULLEN And we protect our family.
She glowers, but picks up the clothes.
Dr. Cullen hits the door opener and the massive METAL DOORS roll open.
Dr. Cullen squeezes Edward's shoulder before he and Esme climb into the SUV.
Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars
DR. CULLEN Amid this, Edward and Bella take a moment together.
BELLA If any of you get hurt because of me
EDWARD We won't, there are five of us, two of them.
EDWARD When it's done, I'll come get you.
He pulls her closer, looking into her eyes.
EDWARD You're my life now.
They drink each other in, possibly for the last time...
as the SUV PEELS out, WIPING THE FRAME
The sun begins to rise on the empty road as a sleek, black MERCEDES SEDAN with dark tinted windows BLASTS through frame
Jasper drives, Alice in the passenger seat.
Bella is in the back, her eyes red from crying.
She talks on her cell phone
BELLA Mom, it's me again.
BELLA You must have
BELLA Anyway, I'm
BELLA not in Forks anymore but I'm okay.
BELLA I'll explain when you call.
BELLA She hangs up, then faces back out the window, watching the green, misty Olympic Peninsula speed past.
BELLA Off Bella's face -
-- show us the landscape as it changes from dark green forests to stretches of grassy hillsides, to drier, browner surroundings, until night falls and headlights lights flash by us.
Finally, we land in..
TREES BLOW PAST US at a blinding speed as we track Edward, Rosalie, and Emmett who dart in and out of frame, blasting through the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the lead.
Edward stops, trying to read his enemy's thoughts.
Rosalie tears a tiny swatch of her shirt, leaves it on a FLOWERING MAPLE TREE.
And then they're gone.
Esme and Dr. Cullen crouch atop a hill, looking down at the river.
In the distance, below, they SEE
BELLA THEIR POV - ON THE LAKE - VICTORIA jogs into view.
BELLA She then looks in their direction.
BELLA Once Dr. Cullen and Esme are assured she has their scent, they continue over the hill's crest.
James blasts past the FLOWERING MAPLE -- then stops, backtracks to the tree, finds the tiny swatch of fabric.
He starts off again..
BELLA but stops, smells the fabric.
BELLA Something's not right.
BELLA He runs back in the opposite direction...
BELLA Uh oh..
ON BELLA'S FACE: her eyes pop open.
She's lying atop a bed, fully clothed.
She rises, reorienting.
The blinds are pulled.
Alice and Jasper stare blankly at a
T.V.
set.
Several plates of food crowd a table.
Alice looks up as Bella enters, looking at her cell phone.
BELLA I wish he'd call.
ALICE You should eat.
But Bella ignores the food.
She sits heavily.
BELLA They could get hurt.
BELLA It's not worth it.
JASPER Yes.
JASPER It is.
She's taken aback.
It's the first time he's engaged with her.
JASPER Edward's changed since he found you.
JASPER And none of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you.
JASPER It's worth it.
Suddenly, Alice REELS.
Jasper goes to her, Bella follows.
JASPER What do you see?
ALICE The tracker.
ALICE He just changed course..
ALICE Jasper quickly sets a pad of paper and pencil in front of her.
JASPER Where will it take him, Alice?
PUSH IN ON ALICE'S FACE as we-
A disorienting vision of him standing in a room full of..
ALICE Mirrors.
ALICE It's a room of mirrors.
Alice begins to draw at HYPER SPEED, closing her eyes, trying to see it clearly.
BELLA How do the visions work?
BELLA Edward said they weren't always certain.
JASPER She sees the course people are on, while they're on it.
JASPER If they change their minds, the visions change.
Bella looks over Alice's shoulder to see the drawing.
BELLA So the course James is on now will lead him to...
BELLA a ballet studio?
ALICE You've been here?
BELLA No.
BELLA I don't know.
BELLA I used to take ballet lessons as a kid.
BELLA The school had an arch like that.
JASPER Was your school here in Phoenix?
BELLA Yeah, around the corner from my house.
BELLA But I haven't been there in ten years.
JASPER Do you have any reason to go now?
BELLA No.
BELLA Hell, no.
BELLA I hated the place.
Alice and Jasper share a look, trying to figure this out.
Suddenly, Bella JUMPS as her cell phone RINGS.
She picks it up.
Sees the caller I.D. and exhales relief.
She answers..
BELLA Edward.
BELLA Are you alright?
Dr. Cullen drives the Jeep, fast, Emmett in the back, Edward in the passenger seat on his cell phone.
EDWARD I'm coming to get you.
EDWARD (hates having to say
this) We lost the tracker.
The woman is still in the area.
Rosalie and Esme are protecting your father.
BELLA This is my fault.
BELLA You warned me, but I didn't think.
BELLA I just..
EDWARD Bella, we're in too deep.
EDWARD We can't change how we feel..
BELLA No...
BELLA we can't.
BELLA When will you get here?
EDWARD In a couple hours.
EDWARD Then you and
EDWARD will go somewhere.
EDWARD Together.
EDWARD The others will keep hunting.
EDWARD Bella, I swear to you, I'll do whatever it takes to make you safe again.
Off Bella, her eyes welling..
SEE Alice in the lobby, settling the bill.
Jasper loads up the car out front.
Bella gathers her things, then her phone RINGS again.
INSERT CALLER I.D. -It reads ?HOME.? Bella answers -
BELLA Mom, I'm so glad you got my -
BELLA Bella?
BELLA Bella?
BELLA Where are you?
BELLA Calm down, Mom.
BELLA Everything is fine, okay?
BELLA I'll explain every
BELLA HEAR RUSTLING on the line, as if Rene dropped the phone.
BELLA ...
BELLA Mom?
BELLA Are you there?
Then Bella HEARS a voice that sends a chill down her spine
BELLA Nice house you have here.
BELLA Not the best on the block, but comfortable.
VERY CLOSE ON JAMES, his sinister eyes and vicious smile.
JAMES I was prepared to wait for you.
JAMES But then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your Dad.
JAMES It all worked out quite well.
Bella's eyes are wild with fear.
JAMES I must say, Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well.
JAMES It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address.
JAMES Bella?
JAMES Bella?..
BELLA Leave my mother out of this.
JAMES You're protective of her.
JAMES That's nice.
JAMES You can still save her.
JAMES But you'll need to get away from your friends.
JAMES Can you do that?
BELLA I...
BELLA don't think so.
JAMES If your mother's life depends on it?
Bella is terrified, but there's no choice here.
BELLA Where should I meet you?
James grins as he fingers a PHOTO of Bella that's attached to the refrigerator with a magnet.
It's the same photo Charlie has of her, age 7, in a tutu, sitting on the floor.
JAMES The old ballet studio around the corner.
JAMES And I'll know if you bring anyone along.
JAMES Poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake.
JAMES She smells like you.
JAMES Delicious.
STAY ON BELLA as she hangs up, panicked.
She starts flinging open drawers, searching for a weapon - a pen, a sewing kit.
Useless.
Then she remembers..
JAMES Her purse.
JAMES She dumps out the contents, and FINDS the pepper spray Charlie gave her.
JAMES She clings to it, her only protection now.
Bella walks through the lobby, scanning for Jasper and Alice.
She spots them outside under the porte cacher, loading the Mercedes, deep in a heated discussion.
She slips out the opposite door, rushes toward a Taxi and jumps in, closes the door.
The DRIVER is an elderly woman with a hacking COUGH.
BELLA 8th and Palo Verde, please.
The taxi pulls out.
Bella watches the hotel disappear.
Off her FACE IN THE REAR WINDOW..
BELLA I've never given much thought to
BELLA how I would die..
Once again, we see the polished malls, the manicured cactus gardens.
All empty for the night.
BELLA But dying in the place of someone
BELLA love seems like a good way to go..
Bella climbs out of the taxi.
It pulls away, leaving her on the curb facing the deserted building.
Bella twirls her mother's ring around her finger, then reaches for the pepper spray.
BELLA I can't bring myself to regret the
BELLA face with death...
BELLA they also
brought me to Edward.
She slips the pepper spray into her jeans pocket.
She wraps her purse strap around her wrist.
She takes a breath, approaches the school.
Peers in the windows.
The blinds are drawn.
But from inside, we HEAR a faint sound..
BELLA Bella?
BELLA Bella?
Bella cautiously enters this grand, empty room of mirrors.
BELLA ballet bar wraps around the walls -
BELLA Bella, where are you?
Bella whirls, trying to find its source.
She follows the sound to a cleaning supply CLOSET.
She throws open the door to FIND
BELLA A T.V. - ON SCREEN A VIDEO PLAYS - Bella, age 7, hides in the very closet the T.V. is in now.
BELLA Little Bella looks up at us.
BELLA Don't you want to dance, baby?
Little Bella shakes her head stubbornly.
The frame jiggles as Rene hands someone the camera.
Rene, ten years younger, appears on screen and kneels next to Bella.
BELLA Everyone makes fun of me.
RENE But you're a wonderful dancer.
BELLA Mom, I suck.
LAUGHTER behind Bella.
She spins, trying to locate James in the mirrors.
JAMES That's my favorite part.
JAMES Stubborn child, weren't you?
Bella's face flushes with rage...
and relief.
BELLA She's not here.
JAMES Sorry.
JAMES But you really made it too easy.
Visible in the mirror, he sighs, disappointed.
Then he steps up next to her and points a VIDEO CAMERA at Bella.
JAMES So to make things more entertaining, I'm going to make a little film of our time together.
JAMES Borrowed this from your house.
JAMES Hope you don't mind.
JAMES And...
JAMES action!
Bella FLINGS her purse at him, and runs for the door.
JAMES Excellent!
JAMES An escape attempt.
Suddenly, he's right behind her.
She freezes.
JAMES It'll break Edward's little heart.
He smells her hair.
Touches her throat.
BELLA Edward has nothing to do with this.
JAMES He will.
JAMES His rage will make for more interesting sport than his feeble attempt to protect you.
JAMES Then she runs, as James REELS back briefly.
JAMES But he leaps over her and lands RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.
Amused, he flings her across the floor like a bowling ball.
She SMASHES hard into a mirrored column.
James captures it on film.
JAMES Beautiful!
JAMES Very visually dynamic.
JAMES I chose my stage well.
He advances toward her.
JAMES Still stubborn, aren't you?
JAMES Is that what makes you special?
JAMES Because frankly, I don't see it.
He inhales as if he can taste her already
JAMES Too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you.
JAMES Instead, he kept you this fragile little human.
JAMES It's cruel, really.
James flips on the camera, but the lens is coated with pepper spray.
He tries to wipe it off.
JAMES Well done!
JAMES You've succeeded in annoying me.
He STOMPS on her shin!
HEAR her tibia SNAP!
Bella SCREAMS in agony.
JAMES Tell Edward how much it hurts.
Abruptly, the camera is in her face
JAMES Tell him to avenge you.
BELLA No!
BELLA Edward, don't..
James inhales as her blood pools.
He leans in, hungry.
Bella, half-conscious, watches him turn the camera on his own face
JAMES Cut!
JAMES The end.
JAMES He rises to find himself face to face with Edward.
JAMES James CHARGES Edward, forcing him up against a column.
JAMES You're alone...
JAMES because you're faster than the others.
JAMES But not stronger.
James SMASHES Edward's face into the mirror until it cracks.
EDWARD I'm strong enough to kill you.
EDWARD James YANKS Edward violently onto the floor -- KNOCKING Bella out of his arms -- as James FLINGS Edward up into the top window -- EMBEDDING him in the casement and bricks.
James crouches beside Bella.
He grabs her HAND
EDWARD Looking directly at Edward with a sinister grin -- he SINKS HIS TEETH into Bella's hand!
EDWARD She SCREAMS in agony.
EDWARD ON BELLA -- as the venom travels through her veins.
EDWARD Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN to see the EXPLOSIVE RAW REALITY of James KICKING Edward, delivering death blows when -
EDWARD Suddenly Edward's hand SHOOTS UP and GRABS James' ankle.
EDWARD Edward ROARS up to his feet and SWINGS James around like a baseball bat, SMASHING him into mirror after mirror.
James is battered, beaten.
Bella moans -- and the sound of her pain slices through Edward.
In an animalistic fury, Edward BITES OFF a piece of James' flesh ..
WHIP PAN from Bella's horrified face to DR.
CULLEN --now standing beside Edward, placing a hand on his son's shoulder.
Edward turns to see his father -- and EMMETT, JASPER, and ALICE, dropping down from the balcony.
Edward's expression changes --he realizes he's gone too far.
He backs off as his siblings crouch into attack mode and LUNGE at James like a pack of animals.
Dr. Cullen rushes to the injured Bella who SCREAMS again in pain.
Edward dashes toward her -
EDWARD BELLA'S POV -ON THE THREE CULLEN SIBLINGS, going in and out of focus...
EDWARD it almost looks like a tribal dance as they rip out the floorboards and build a fire ...
EDWARD it's like a funeral pyre as they rip James apart, throwing limbs into the fire..
EDWARD BACK ON BELLA -- as Edward reaches her side.
EDWARD Dr. Cullen works fast to assess her wounds, focusing on a massive bleed from her leg.
EDWARD But clearly her hand hurts the most.
EDWARD She writhes in pain.
Dr. Cullen applies pressure to the gash on her thigh -
DR. CULLEN Her femoral artery's been severed.
DR. CULLEN She's losing too much blood
BELLA It's on fire!
BELLA My hand!
EDWARD Venom -
DR. CULLEN You have to make a choice.
DR. CULLEN Either
let the change happen
EDWARD No!
BELLA'S POV -ALICE appears behind Edward, fuzzy, indistinct.
ALICE It's going to happen.
ALICE I've seen it
EDWARD It doesn't have to be that way.
DR. CULLEN Alice, find me a tourniquet.
DR. CULLEN rag, a shirt.
Alice holds her nose and avoids the blood as she rips the sleeve off her blouse and kneels to aid Dr. Cullen.
BELLA It's burning!
EDWARD What's the other choice?
EDWARD You said
DR. CULLEN Tighter, above the knee
EDWARD Carlisle.
DR. CULLEN You can try to suck the venom out.
EDWARD I -- won't be able to stop
DR. CULLEN Find the will to stop.
DR. CULLEN But choose, she only has minutes left.
Edward looks down at Bella, thrashing in pain.
Finally, Edward takes her hand.
She tries to pull it away.
EDWARD It's alright, Bella.
EDWARD I'll make it go away.
He looks at her - then starts to suck the venom from her hand.
They never take their eyes off one another, the connection palpable, intense..
EDWARD CLOSE ON BELLA'S EYES -wild with pain.
EDWARD But subsiding..
CLOSE ON EDWARD'S EYES -the frenzy has begun.
He sucks harder.
Hungrily.
Anguished, he wants to stop but can't.
Dr. Cullen's voice sounds miles away..
DR. CULLEN Stop.
DR. CULLEN Her blood is clean, you're killing her.
-- but the bloodlust is too strong.
He is killing her.
Bella looks at him, forgivingly, as she begins to lose consciousness..
DR. CULLEN BELLA'S POV -ON EDWARD -growing blurry...
DR. CULLEN he disappears into the blinding light.
DR. CULLEN It's as if she's underwater, like her dreams..
DR. CULLEN Death is peaceful.
DR. CULLEN Easy.
Bella starts to float away...
we're losing her..
DR. CULLEN Suddenly from the darkness, Edward reaches out a hand..
DR. CULLEN A brilliant light flares..
Eyes closed.
But they slowly open.
She squints at the light.
BELLA Life...
BELLA is harder..
BELLA An oxygen tube rests under her nose.
BELLA She reaches for it, confused.
BELLA A hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus.
BELLA You're awake, baby!
BELLA You're okay!!
Bella lies in a hospital bed.
Bandaged, leg in a cast.
In bad
shape.
Rene hovers over her, tears in her eyes.
On the dresser,
SEE get well cards and a PHOTO MONTAGE of her friends from Forks.
BELLA Edward?
BELLA Where's -
RENE He's asleep.
RENE She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward ?sleeps.
RENE He never leaves.
RENE And your dad's down in the cafeteria.
BELLA What...
BELLA happened?
RENE Baby, you fell down two flights of stairs and through a window.
Bella is drawing a blank, confused.
Rene jogs her memory
RENE Edward came here to convince you to come back to Forks.
RENE His father brought him down.
RENE You went to their hotel but you tripped on the stairs.
RENE A moment...
RENE then Bella realizes it's a cover story.
RENE She nods.
BELLA Sounds like me.
Rene's cell phone BEEPS.
She opens it.
Reads a text, starts typing in a reply.
RENE It's Phil.
RENE He's worried about you.
BELLA Mom, you're...
BELLA texting.
RENE I told him to stay in Florida.
RENE The Suns signed him!
BELLA That's great mom.
RENE Jacksonville is always sunny and you'll have your own bathroom..
BELLA Mom, wait.
BELLA I want to live in Forks.
BELLA I have Dad..
BELLA ...
BELLA and friends..
RENE And he's there.
Bella shrugs, conceding the truth.
RENE Charlie doesn't like him.
RENE Blames him for your leaving.
BELLA What do you think?
RENE I think that boy is in love with you.
Bella smiles.
Rene grins.
Bella glances at Edward.
BELLA Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad?
BELLA want to talk to him.
BELLA Apologize.
RENE I'm sure he doesn't care about that, Baby.
RENE But I?ll go get him.
Rene kisses Bella's forehead.
Exits.
Bella watches her go.
The door shutting behind her.
Bella turns back to find Edward standing next to her with deep concern.
Her eyes well.
He kisses her forehead soothingly.
BELLA Is James - did you --
EDWARD We took care of him.
EDWARD And the woman, Victoria, she ran off.
She closes her eyes with relief, then looks at him.
BELLA I'm alive because of you.
EDWARD You're in here because of me.
Her wounds cause him pain.
He strokes her face.
EDWARD The worst of it...
EDWARD was thinking
EDWARD couldn't stop -
BELLA But you did.
EDWARD Bella, you should go to Jacksonville.
EDWARD Where I can't hurt you anymore..
BELLA What?
BELLA No!
BELLA I want to be with you!
BELLA don't want
EDWARD Sssh.
EDWARD It's alright.
EDWARD I'm not going anywhere.
EDWARD I'm right here..
EDWARD He wraps an arm around her.
EDWARD As she curls up in his arms..
An AERIAL SWEEP over the lush green forests.
We're back in the misty, damp beauty of the Pacific Northwest..
At a picnic table, Charlie cleans a fish with a big knife.
Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in an elegant suit.
But even calm Edward is unnerved by Charlie's glare.
The front door opens and they look up to see
EDWARD BELLA --framed in the doorway in a stunning long dress.
EDWARD Edward is enchanted.
EDWARD Bella descends the steps with difficulty, due to her LEG CAST.
EDWARD Charlie edges out Edward to help her down.
BELLA Alice lent me the dress.
BELLA It was the
BELLA cast.
BELLA Is it too...
EDWARD You're perfect...
EDWARD I'll take good
care of her, Chief.
CHARLIE Heard that before.
Edward moves to open the car door.
Charlie holds Bella back.
CHARLIE I put new pepper spray in your bag.
BELLA Dad.
CHARLIE ...
CHARLIE and...
CHARLIE you look beautiful.
Father and daughter share a smile..
Edward's Volvo pulls up to this lovely inn.
He helps Bella out of the car, and begins to guide her through the dining room.
Mr. Molina and other teachers are there.
We may notice the back of a Redhead, mingling with the chaperones.
BELLA I can't believe you're making me do
BELLA He just grins.
BELLA Edward guides her around a corner to..
THE PROM - Monte Carlo style.
Gaming tables and roulette wheels.
Guys in tuxes and girls in gowns gamble for prizes, dance and socialize.
BELLA You really are trying to kill me.
EDWARD Prom is an important rite of passage.
EDWARD I don't want you to miss anything.
She can't be mad at him, just shakes her head affectionately.
They continue into the prom.
Several heads turn.
Bella sees
EDWARD THE DANCE FLOOR, where a gap has formed.
EDWARD In the middle, two couples whirl gracefully.
EDWARD It's Alice and Jasper, Rosalie and Emmett, looking absolutely stunning.
Rosalie glances over; indifference has replaced fury.
But Alice waves brightly.
Bella returns it with a smile as we hear a crossfade into the next track-
EDWARD It's Eric at the turntables, making the room bounce!
EDWARD Next to him, Angela wears the headphones, flipping through a stack of vinyl.
EDWARD They nod at Bella -- she shoots them a smile when -
EDWARD A FLASHBULB gets her attention
Mike and Jessica stand in front of an Aston Martin cut-out.
Bella catches their eye -- Mike does his best James Bond impersonation.
Jessica poses like Pussy Galore.
Edward smirks, then turns to Bella
EDWARD Shall we?
BELLA You're serious.
He doesn't wait for an answer, more or less CARRIES her to the DANCE FLOOR -- then places her feet atop his own...
and starts to move.
She actually begins to enjoy it.
EDWARD See?
EDWARD You're dancing.
BELLA At prom.
BELLA Edward...
BELLA why did you save me?
BELLA If you'd let the venom spread, I could've been like you by now.
EDWARD You don't know what you're saying.
EDWARD You don't want this.
BELLA I want you.
BELLA Always.
EDWARD I won't end your life for you.
He keeps dancing, slowly, hoping his was the last word.
BELLA I'm dying anyway.
BELLA Every minute, I get closer, older
EDWARD That's how it's supposed to happen.
BELLA Not the way Alice saw it.
BELLA I heard her.
BELLA She saw me like you.
EDWARD Her visions change, Bella.
BELLA Based on what someone decides.
BELLA And I've decided.
He looks at her, angry.
EDWARD Is that what you dream about?
EDWARD Becoming a monster?
BELLA I dream about being with you forever.
EDWARD You really want this?
BELLA Yes.
EDWARD You're ready right now?
BELLA Yes.
His lips hover over her skin, a long beat...
then he presses his lips to her throat.
Not a bite.
A kiss.
He looks at her.
EDWARD You're going to have a long and happy life with me.
EDWARD Isn't that enough?
She looks at him...
and finally smiles.
BELLA For now.
They WHIRL around, gliding on his grace, never looking away from one another, as we CRANE UP on them, in each other's arms..
BELLA (V.O.) No one will surrender tonight.
BELLA (V.O.) But I won't give in.
BELLA (V.O.) I know what I want.
BELLA (V.O.) ...
BELLA (V.O.) someone's watching it, looking down from the window of a second floor hotel room in the Inn.
BELLA (V.O.) The MUSIC wafting up in echoes.
BELLA (V.O.) PULL BACK to REVEAL..
VICTORIA, turning from the window.
She's stylishly dressed now, but seething -- a low, sinister SNARL in the back of her throat.
PUSH IN FAST ON HER FACE, AND INTO HER BURGUNDY EYES filled with vengeance as we
