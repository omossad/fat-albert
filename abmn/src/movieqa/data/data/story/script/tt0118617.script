on a well-worn PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM.
An ELDERLY WOMAN'S HAND touched the album, caressing it lovingly for a moment, as WE HEAR her voice.
TATIANA (O.C.) Once we lived in an enchanted world.
She opend the ALBUM to reveal a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH of the PALACE AT ST.
PETERSBERG on a brilliant summer day.
TATIANA (CONT) A world of Tsars and Princesses and elegant palaces.
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER TO the picture.
TATIANA (CONT) and grand parties.
The PHOTO dissolves into REALITY in brilliant color as the day turns into night and the summer cools into winter.
We see the palace at night, blanketed in a beautiful, almost glowing, snow as hourse drawn carriages pull up to the front door.
TATIANA (CONT) A beautiful, magical time.
TATIANA (CONT) That would soon be gone forever.
Elegant ROYALISTS mingle around the MAIN HALL as an ORCHESTRA plays.
All eyes turn to the GLASS DOORS OF TWO ELEVADORS which descend grandly on either side of a beautiful staircase.
Through the glass doors we see TATIANA, the Dowager Empress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she is seemingly unapproachable.
TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON are with her.
In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and her daughters - well, all her daughters except.
ANASTASIA, eight years old and apparently late for the party, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by a SERVENT (SONYA) 16, who is trying to catch up with Anastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair.
SONYA Princess Anastasia - you're late and it's all my fault!
ANASTASIA Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll notice.
Just then, Sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair, stopping Anastasia with a
ANASTASIA owwwwwwwww!
All eyes turn to Anastasia, who once she realizes that she's the center of attention, flashes a mischievous smile and descends the staircase in grand style.
As the ribbon falls out of her hair and down her back, Anastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride.
Tatiana sees her and can't help but smile.
The music suddenly becomes a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS.
SERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILY steps out and begins a proccession through their subjects.
Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as she makes it to Tatiana's side just in time.
Anastasia has a beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by large, blue, mischievous eyes.
She an abundance of energy and confidence for a girl her age.
<u>"THE RULARS OF RUSSIA" (OPENING NUMBER)
The elegant guests sing their admiration as the beautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entrance into the ball, they're "the pride of all Russia".
Vladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entire glittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING WALTZ.
Singing their certainty that the Romanovs will rule forever.</u>
During the above, the ball is in full swing.
Beautiful COUPLES swirls across the dance floor, including Anastasia dancing gracefully with her father.
Under a long buffet table, we see DMITRI, 11, darkly handsome, dressed in ragged servant clothes, with a shock of dark hair which continuoually falls accross his eyes as watches the guest enviously.
Anastasia, still waltzing with her father, sees him.
SERVENTS cross the room carrying a trays of BEAUTIFUL TROPICAL FRUIT.
The guests "Ew" and "ah" at the sumptuous fruit.
Anastasia sees Dmitri eyeing it hungrily and without missing a dance step, she grabs an orange off thr tray and tosses it to Dmitri.
He catches it and smiles broadly at her.
Suddenly, A HAND grabs Dmitri and pulls him out from under the table.
It's IVAR, the HEAD SERVENT, who pulls Dmitri into an open wall panel.
IVAR You're a servent!
IVAR Never forget your place!
DMITIRI Someday my place will be out there!
IVAR Never!
IVAR You're a peasant, Dmitri!
IVAR Back in the kitchen
<u>RULARS OF RUSSIA (CONT.)
UNDERSCORE CONTINUES as Dmitri is dragged from his hiding place under the table and back to the kitchen.
It's like the Moscow circus back there, COMIC MUSICAL CONFUSION.
The servants sing about their demanding employers and mockingly imitate their behavior: they imply that they have their own "party", that change is coming.
While back in the ballroom, the Royalists are oblivious to the servants discontent and sing their satisfaction with their own lives.
DRAMATIC UNDERSCORE CONTINUES though the following scenes.</u>
ON TATIANA in a large throne-like chair.
Tatiana is very serious and very regal.
She slides over to make room for Anastasia who sits next to her.
TATIANA Why were you so late tonight
ANASTASIA I was showing Sonya something .
TATIANA What were you showing her?
ANASTASIA How to read.
TATIANA I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
ANASTASIA I know, but I had to because .
Anastasia looks up at Tatiana and sees her smile with pride.
Anastasia knows she doesn't have to explain.
ANASTASIA Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
TATIANA It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you .
Tatiana reaches from behind the chair and brings out a beautiful MUSIC BOX.
Tatiana takes the key, a small silver and enamel flower, on a silver neck chain and winds it up.
MUSIC BEGINS, she hands Anastasia the key.
CLOSE UP the key bearing the inscription "Together in Paris".
ANASTASIA "Together in Paris"!
ANASTASIA Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
TATIANA When you're older .
Anastasia makes a disgruntled face.
Tatiana laughs.
TATIANA Until then, whenever you hear this song, think of me and know that I'm waiting for you.
Tatiana puts the key around Anastasia's neck and they embrace.
Then, suddenly .
ON THE GRAND CHANDELIER the lights begin to fade in and out.
GROUP SHOT as PEOPLE in the ballroom look around bewildered.
Then, a WHIRLWIND kicks up, sending everyone off the dance floor, as the whirlwind becomes a TORNADO.
Suddenly, an ALBINO BAT (BARTOK) with huge eyes, springs out of the funnel, screeching and swooping over the crowd, causing everyone to duck and cover their heads in fear.
The tornada reaches it's peak and EXPLODES in smoke - leaving RASPUTIN standing alone in the middle of the floor.
He is of indeterminate age, towering over other men in the room, his most striking feature are his eyes - which at this moment are burning a fiery red.
He is dressed in a flowing black monk's robe with a satin rope tied around his waist.
Connected to the rope is a glowing RELIQUARY, a mystical lantern.
VARIOUS SHOTS of Nicholas, Alexandra, Sophie and Vladimir, Dmitri peeking out ofthe wallpanel, Tatiana and Anastasia, all of whom are frightened.
NICHOLAS as he gathers his son and wife to his side
NICHOLAS Rasputin!
NICHOLAS You're alive .
RASPUTIN Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river .
NICHOLAS I had nothing to do with it!
RASPUTIN You gave the orders!
NICHOLAS I did no such thing!
RASPUTIN After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL
Rasputin swings the reliquary, wrapping himself in smoke which seems to grow larger.
Eerie moaning noises come from the reliquary.
PEOPLE back awayin terror.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) The Romanov dynasty ends here!
RASPUTIN (CONT.) You, your wife and children will all die within the fortnight!
Anastasia leaves Tatiana and rushes to stand in front of her father.
Still holding her Music Box, Anastasia's shaking hands are the only thing that gives away her fear.
Rasputin spins toward the voice.
ANASTASIA We're not afraid of you!
RASPUTIN You .
RASPUTIN my little babushka .
RASPUTIN you'll be so much fun to kill that I'll save you for last!
Twirling the reliquary again, the MOANS grow louder as Bartok circles around his head.
The smoke that emerges seems to have almosy a human shape to it.
The tornada of smoke begins again, whipping into a frenzy and then EXPLODING.
The smoke clears and Rasputin is gone.
As the lights return to normal the Romanov family all stand together, and try to look regal and in control once again.
TATIANA (O.C.) Some say Rasputin ad harnessed all the dark powers of evil and that it was his curse which brought about the end .
the ROMANOV FAMILY fades into a PORTRAIT OF THE FAMILY.
TATIANA (O.C.) I will never know for sure.
TATIANA (O.C.) All I do know is that the beauty of our world was soon Gone .
TATIANA (O.C.) Forever .
a lick of BRIGHT ORANGE FLAME creeps into view.
<u>"RULERS OF RUSSIA" (VOCAL REPRISE)
HUGE, OMINOUS VOCALS reprise the onceglorious watlz of the Romanovs, heralding the end of their world and underscoring the coming revolution.</u>
PULL BACK to see the PORTRAIT, a huge FRIEZE which covers an entire entire wall, singeing as the FLAME creeps up the nearby drapery, tinting the room in a red glow.
A SCREAMING MOB, some in uniform, some not, has crashed into the palace and is heading up the stairs.
A few in the mob fire off orange RIFLE SHOTS.
Anastasia BOLTS UP, hearing the shots.
Her music box is next to her on her nightstand.
Mass confusion as the MOB is met by a few SERVANTS, who try to stop them from advancing.
More shots.
ON THE ROMANOV'S still in nightclothes, are being rushed down the hallway.
Tatiana is next to Anastasia as Anastasia stopsdead in her tracks.
ANASTASIA My music mox!
Anastasia turns around and runs back down the hall.
Tatiana tries to stop her.
TATIANA Anastasia, no!
It's too late, Anastasia fights her way back into her room, with Tatiana following her.
FROM THE OTHER END OF THE HALLWAY we see Dmitri watching amidst all the confusion.
Anastasia grabs her music box as Tatiana rushes in.
TATIANA Hurry, child!
LOUD RIFLE SHOTS are heard as Dmitri bursts into the room, closing the door behind him.
DMITRI No - this way!
Dmitri runs to a wall panel and thows his weight against it.
It opens, revealing a passage way.
DMITRI (CONT.) Go!
DMITRI (CONT.) Run!!
DMITRI (CONT.) Out the servant's quarters!
Tatiana, enormously grateful, looks at Dmitri as he flips his hair out of his face unconsciously.
DMITRI Go!
Tatiana goes in as Dmitri shoves Anastasia toward the passageway, knocking the music box out of her hand.
She reaches for it, but hearing the mob voices growing closer, he pushes her through the panel without it.
DMITRI (CONT.) Go!
Tatiana quickly follows Anastasia into the passageway and Dmitri closes the panel JUST AS the mob bursts in.
DMITRI (CONT.) No one's here!
DMITRI (CONT.) Let's try the next room!
The MOB, accepts the word of a peasant boy and rushes out.
Dmitri picks up the music box and looks sadly toward the panel.
Which is under siege by ROYALISTS trying to board the overcrowded train and the REVOLUTIONARIES who are trying to stop them.
A TOURING CAR pulls up RIGHT ON THE TRACKS behind the caboose as the train starts to pull away.
Tatiana and Anastasia climb out of the car and race for the train, fighting their way through the frenzied and frightened crowd.
WE HEAR shouts of "The Empress - let her through!" which helps clear the way.
Anastasia reaches the train first, then turns to see Tatiana.
trying to catch up.
ANASTASIA Hurry, Grandmama!
TATIANA Get on!
TATIANA Anastasia, get on!
Anastasia refuses to board the train.
A MOB OF REVOLUTIONARIES block the tracks with a TRUCK
ON ANASTASIA who pushes Tatiana up the stairs of the caboose.
This puts Anastasia a few steps behind as the train speeds up.
Tatiana is gripped by other passengers as she reaches out to Anastasia.
TATIANA Grab my hand!
Anastasia reaches up and takes Tatiana's hand.
ANASTASIA Don't let go!
CLOSE ON the TWO HANDS.
then suddenly.
her small hand is pulled from Tatiana's grasp and falls out of the frame.
ON ANASTASIA who has stumbled, hitting the ground hard.
ON TATIANA horrified, screaming:
Tatiana rushes to jump off the train after her, but is caught and held back by the ROYALIST PASSANGERS as the train CRASHES through the truck and picks up speed.
TATIANA's POV:
Anastasia rising from the ground, her hand outstretched.
But she is suddenly swallowed up by the mob.
A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH of Anastasia, in a happier time, smiling.
<u>UNDERSCORE: "THE MUSIC BOX THEME"</u>
TATIANA (O.C.) I never saw her again.
The PHOTO ALBUM slowly closes.
<u>END OPENING NUMBER</u>
A gray and ugly, post-revolution building with a sign above the door that identifies it: "Young Comrades Without Parents".
CHILDREN of all ages clean the cold, gray dormitory.
Their clothes are ragged and they look underfed.
ANYA, 18, pretty despite the boy's hand-me-down clothes she is forced to wear, is busy scrubbing the floor.
Unlike the others, she is determined not to let her surroundings get to her.
She hums a tune.
The door suddenly SLAMS open and GREGOR, 8, and clearly terrified, comes running in followed by COMRADE PHLEGMENKOF - a huge woman carrying a switch.
GREGOR Anya!
GREGOR Anya!
All of the OTHER KIDS turn away, not wanting to get involved.
Anya focuses on Gregor, who is shivering with fright and on the verge of tears as Phlegmenkof approaches, swinging the switch menacingly.
PHLEGMENKOF You can't get away from me now .
Phlegmenkof advances on Gregor.
Anya takes the scrub brush and SHOVES it across the floor, right under Phlegmenkof's unsuspecting foot.
Phlegmenkof's feet fly out from under her and she SMASHES to the floor.
Gregor hops over her huge body and runs to Anya for safety.
Some of the OTHER KIDS glance over.
A CHUBBY GIRL and a very pretty LITTLE GIRL, look at Anya with greeat admiration .
someof the OTHERS think she's crazy.
Phlegmenkof rises, covered with soap bubbles , and spins on Anya - who gives her a very innocent smile.
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) You!
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) You did this!
Some of the OTHER CHILDREN laugh as soap bubbles fly off the enraged woman.
She spins on them, her back to Anya.
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) Brats!
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) There'll be no supper for any of you!
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) Back to work!
Anya, behind Phlegmenkof, mimics her outraged face and angry gestures perfectly - as the CHILDREN laugh harder.
Phlegmenkof spins and <u>almost</u> catches Anya.
She advances on Anya as Gregor hides behind her legs.
ANYA Don't touch him.
PHLEGMENKOF You ragged, skinny, little nothing!
PHLEGMENKOF I have had just about enough of you .
Phlegmenkof raises her hand to slap Anya, who hold her ground.
Suddenly, Phlegmenkof SNIFFS the air.
ON THE KIDS as the horrible smell reaches them too.
They all make faces and hold their noses.
ON PHLEGMENKOF who first sniffs under her raised arm, then realized the cause of the stench .
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) Comrade Serebreakov!
She tries to straighten herself out nervously - this must be someone very important.
COMRADE SEREBREAKOV stands in the doorway, lecherously eyeing the girls.
He is a huge, fleshly man with facial features which are reminiscent of a fish.
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) Comrade Serebreakov!
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) What a lovely surprise!
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) What brings you here?
SEREBREAKOV I need.
SEREBREAKOV a worker.
His eye catches Anya.
He looks her up and down, his beady eyes showing a touch of lust for her.
SEREBREAKOV (CONT.) I will take her.
He leans close close to Anya.
SEREBREAKOV (CONT.) Tomorrow you begin your life's work in my hearing factory.
SEREBREAKOV (CONT.) You'll start by cutting off the tails - but if I'm pleased with
SEREBREAKOV (CONT.) you - you just may move up to cutting off the heads.
SEREBREAKOV (CONT.) How does that sound?
ANYA About as bad as you smell!
Phlegmenkof moves between them, pulling Serebreakov away.
PHLEGMENKOF No, no, Comrade - you don't want her .
SEREBREAKOV I want her.
PHLEGMENKOF That's horrible, skinny thing?!
PHLEGMENKOF She's crazy - she has no memory of anything before she came here!
PHLEGMENKOF She didn't even know her name!
PHLEGMENKOF That one is a rotten troublemaker, willful.
SEREBREAKOV I'll break her will.
SEREBREAKOV I shall come for you tomorrow at dawn.
SEREBREAKOV You will enjoy serving under me.
Smiling in anticipation, he exit.
PHLEGMENKOF I couldn't break you - but he can!
And she turns to leave in a huff.
Anya does one more imitation of her, making the CHILDREN laugh.
But as Anya turns away from her audience, we see her facade fade and realize her terror of the future.
The CHILDREN huddle in their cots under tattered, thin blankets.
Anya is fully dressed, illuminated by the
light of a FULL MOON, she ties a dull gray sheets together and anchors the "rope" to an ice cold radiator and throws the other end out of the window.
She is about to climb out when she looks at the sleeping children and smiles sadly.
She walks over to Gregor's bed and puts one hand lovingly on his head and then reaches over and takes the hand of a sleeping LITTLE GIRL, who opens her eyes and smiles.
GREGOR Anya?
The other childern wake up as Anya gently "shushes" him.
GREGOR (CONT.) Are you running away?
ANYA No.
ANYA I'm running <u>to</u>.
LITTLE GIRL Running to?
LITTLE GIRL Running to what?
ANYA To find my home.
A CHUBBY TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL looks at Anya.
CHUBBY GIRL But you are home.
ANYA No.
ANYA This isn't a home - it's just a building.
ANYA Home is where you belong and none of us belong here.
GREGOR Where is your home, Anya?
ANYA I'm not sure but look.
Anya shows Gregor the key around her neck.
CLOSE UP on the inscription: "Together in Paris"
ANYA It says "Together in Paris".
ANYA I was wearing this when I came here ten years ago - it's the only way that I know .
ANYA (CONT.) that I must have been someone someone loved.
CHUBBY GIRL Is your home in Paris?
ANYA It might be.
ANYA I have to go and find out.
Anya smiles lovingly at the children.
<u>"A SOMEPLACE AND A SOMEONE"
(Anya's "I want" song).
Anya SINGS SOFTLY to the children about how all she has is the key around her neck to the "someone and thesomeplace" she was "lost from long ago".
She tells the children that she must go find them again.</u>
UNDERSCORE continues.
ANYA I have to go now, before it gets light.
GREGOR But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
ANYA Then you'll have to make your own home.
ANYA Lots of people do.
Anya embraces the children and walks to the window.
GREGOR Anya!
GREGOR What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
ANYA Then come find me.
Gregor is relieved and cuddles into his bed as Anya smiles lovingly and crawls out the window.
Anya begins to climb down the street, testing the knots.
The knotshold tight, but the old sheet RIPS in half, sending her PLUMMETING into a snow drift.
From the depths of the snow we HEAR her voice.
ANYA (O.C.) I hope there's no snow in Paris.
A glorious bright (and cold) dawn creeps over the horizon.
Anya stands at edge of the hill, looking down on the city of ST.PETERSBURG.
The old gray orphanage looms behind her.
Anya "borrows" an old, beat-up bicycle from the orphanage and rides down the hill.
Music picks up in energy and excitement as Anya zooms on her way bumping and bouncing downhill as the sunrises and St.
Petersburg looms nearer.
<u>"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.)
Music becomes UPTEMPO, HOPEFUL, ACTIVE, ACTIVE.
Anya SINGS - - full of hope, energy and excitement as she peddls her rickety bike toward the city.
"Her heart is on its way" and nothing is going to stop her.</u>
Anya passes though the countryside toward the city.
A peasant family waves to her as she goes by.
A Gypsy Troupe performs tricks by the side of the road.
A very fancy car zooms by.
<u>"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.)
Anya SINGS, imagining who she might be -- anyone from a peasant to a princess!
But it doesn't matter as long as she finds her real family.</u>
People stare at her as she rides into the edge of the city.
She is captivated by all the activity: cars, busses, stores, long lines of people, etc.
<u>"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.)
Anya SINGS -- in this sea faces, there must be someone who has a clue to her identity.
She'll stop at nothing to find the someone who once loved her.
SOARING
END MUSICAL NUMBER</u>
Anya does not see a cute little PUPPY (MEETOO) with a HUGE BONE in his mouth, being chased along the sidewalk by a pack of much larger, vicious DOGS until he bolts across Anya's path forcing her to skid to a stop.
She watched him as he scoots into an alley, followed by the angry pack.
On reflex, Anya drops the bike and reuns into the alley after him.
Meetoo is trapped.
The PACK surrounds him, ready to pounce when Anya LEAPS into the middle of the circle.
The PACK is startled, but begins to advance on both Anya and Meetoo.
Anya doesn't know what to do.
She crouches and then.
growls back at them, making her eyes look as ferocious as possible.
The PACK exchange a confused look; there's a girl growling at them.
Meetoo stands, suddenly brave, behind her and growls along with her.
Suddenly, Anya pounced toward the pack, growling louder.
The pack has definately had enough - some start to back out quizzically, others turn and run like hell.
Anya turns to Meetoo, who looks up at her gratefully, wagging his tail.
Anya picks up the bone and puts it back in his mouth.
ANYA I think you should be more careful about who you invite to dinner!
Meetoo nods and lets out a little "bark" that sounds as if he were saying "retu".
Anya pats him and heads back to her bike.
Anya rides down the street.
She doesn't see Meetoo, running like a little maniac behind her.
Anya approaches a STERN LOOKING BUILDING with a sign over the door: "The People's Bureau of Bureaucracy".
She leaps off her bike and heads up the stais.
Meetoo, breathing heavily from his run, follows and almost reaches her when the heavy door slams in his face.
He slumps against it, panting, his little paw-to chest.
Anya enters and STOPS when she sees.
LINES and LINES of people which seem to go on forever.
She walks down the side of one line, trying to figure out which one to stand in.
ANYA Could someone tell me.
PEASANT 1 End of the line!
ANYA Which line?
PEASANT 2 Any line.
PEASANT 3 All lines are good lines.
PEASANT 1, 2, & 3 In our beloved Soviet Union!
They turn toward an armed Soviet Guard and smile sweetly, hoping he heard their flattery.
He did.
GUARD Very good.
He jots something down in his notebook.
ON ANYA as she gets closer to the window.
She turns to the person behind her.
ANYA Is this the right line to get papers to travel?
PEASANT 4 Travel?
PEASANT 4 Travel to where?
ANYA To Paris.
ANYA I have to get to Paris
PEASANT 5, in front of her, turns around.
PEASANT 5 Paris?!
PEASANT 5 What do they have in Paris that they don't have here?
PEASANT 6 Shorter lines?!
Peasant 6 is immediately carted off by TWO ARMED GUARDS for his blasphamy against the state.
PEASANT 7 Nobody leaves Soviet Russia.
The OTHER PEASANTS join in with variations of "Nobody leaves Russia" as Anya reaches the window and speaks to the clerk.
ANYA Is this where I get traveling papers?
CLERK It would be if we let you travel which we don't so it isn't.
CLERK Russia is the people's paradise!
And to further make his point, he slams shut his window, which immediately opens a crack as he whispers to Anya.
CLERK (CONT.) See Dmitri.
CLERK (CONT.) He can help.
He shuts the window, only to open it again immediately.
CLERK (CONT.) But you didn't hear it from me.
He shuts the window.
ANYA I didn't
He opens it again.
CLERK No.
The clerk sticks out a sign: "Samovar Break - back in ten minutes" and slams the window shut.
Anya steps out of the building, still not seeing Meetoo and looks around at the hoards of people waiting in lines for everything: bread, gas, clothes, etc.
ANYA Dmitri?
ANYA There must be a million Dmitris.
FOLLOW ANYA as she wades into the crowded street.
Meetoo getting tangled in the legs of waiting Soviets.
Anya stops suddenly.
She sniffs the air.
Her eyes widen as she recognizes the stench that is floating through the air.
She spins around and sees Serebreakov
Serebreakov is on a mission to find Anya.
He turns in her direction just as a bus passes.
Anya is gone.
We now see Anya clinging to the side of the bus as it drives down the street.
Meetoo looks, his face dropping - he knows he'll never catch up to her now.
Then he sees the bus hit a huge pothole and Anya is knocked off into the mud.
Happily, Meetoo trots off in her direction.
Anya approaches TWO PEASANTS who are waiting in line in front of a cafe.
PEASANT 9 Which line is this?
PEASANT 10 The line to get into the line.
ANYA Excuse me, do you know Dmitri.
PEASANT 9 I know nothing!
PEASANT 10 Nothing!
PEASANTS 9 & 10 Try the tavern/ library.
They begin to bicker back and forth in forced whispers as to wether Dmitri is at the tavern or the library.
Exasperated, Anya walks away.
They call after her.
PEASANTS9& 10 But we didn't tell you!
Anya rolls her eyes in frustration.
She doesn't see Meetoo at her feet.
ANYA I wish they'd all stop telling me they didn't tell me!
Meetoo gives a "retu" of agreement.
Anya looks down and sees him.
ANYA (CONT.) What are you doing.
Just then, she catches another whiff of something foul in the air.
Anya duck quickly into a doorway and loses Meetoo.
Anya peeks out.
A GARBAGE WAGON full of dead fish and rotten food passes Anya.
She sighs with relief, it wasn't Serebreakov - it just smelled like him.
Anya steps out of the doorway and approaches a STREET ARTIST sketching a LARGE PEASANT WOMAN as her TINY HUSBAND looks over his shoulder.
TINY HUSBAND Could you get rid of her moustache?
ANYA Excuse me - I'm looking for a man named Dmitri.
The Artist quickly scribbles and address on his pad and hands it to her without turning around.
ARTIST But I didn't write it.
Anya looks down at the note
"St.
Petersburg Art Theatre - 99 Pushkin Street"
"Pushkin Street"
Where WE HEAR a cacophony of FEMALE VOICES as the camera moves inside.
The waiting room is filled with YOUNG WOMEN, of various shapes and sizes, holding reading aloud from a piece of paper.
WE HEAR many variations of "Oh, Grandmama!
It's me, Anastasia.
I've waited so long to see you".
An ACTRESS stands in front of what looks to be an OLD WOMAN in a shawl who's back is to the "audience".
ACTRESS 1 Oh, Grandmama!
ACTRESS 1 It's me, Anastasia!
ACTRESS 1 I've waited so long to see you!
The Actress then LUMBERS over to the OLD WOMAN, with a gait like John Wayne.
REVERSE ANGLE to see the "Old Woman" is Vladimir, with a shawl over his head.
He looks older, of course, but with the same dapper mustache.
He rolls his eyes.
VLADIMIR Dmitri!
VLADIMIR I can not work with her!
VLADIMIR (CONT.) May I remind you that you are supposed to be Princess - not a lazy lumbering lout!
IN THE SEATS is Dmitri.
Now 20 and darkly handsome.
His hair still falling in his eyes as he flips it off his forehead.
DMITRI Vladimir, calm down!
Vladimir walks off the stage and toward Dmitri.
VLADIMIR This, my friend, as an exercise in futility!
VLADIMIR We shall never find a girl to play the Princess Anastasia out of this motley crew of commoners!
Vladimir dramatically throws one end of his shawl over his shoulder.
DMITRI For a ten million rubles reward we can look a little longer.
DMITRI This is the big one.
DMITRI and all I need is the right girl.
<u>"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (REPRISE

DMITRI Next.
Anya rides up to front of the theatre and drops her bike.
She rushes the steps.
INT.  THEATRE now empty as Dmitri and Vladimir are gathering up their things to leave.
Vladimir still wears the remnants of the evening clothes that he worein the first scene.
VLADIMIR It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
DMITRI We will.
DMITRI We <u>have</u> to.
DMITRI Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
They walk out the door.
DMITRI She could be right under our nose
Anya is running up the stairs as Dmitri walks out and they COLLIDE: her forehead banging Dmitri literally under his nose.
Dmitri grabs his upper lip in pain.
DMITRI Ouch!
DMITRI That really hurt!
ANYA I'm sorry.
ANYA I'm.
That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
In her old hand-me-down boys clothes andhat pulled low, she could easily be mistaken for a boy.
ANYA I'm looking for Dmitri.
ANYA I need traveling papers - to Paris.
ANYA I heard Dmitri could help me.
Vladimir and Dmitri exchange a look.
wary.
Dmitri looks around and motions to Vladimir to handle it while he walks ahead nonchalantly.
VLADIMIR Who did you hear it from?
ANYA I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!
ANYA Do you know Dmitri?
Dmitri keeps walking ahead followed by Vladimir.
Anya is determined not to give up and keeps up with Vladimir even though she keeps getting bumped and pulled off track by people walking in the opposite direction.
VLADIMIR Providing travel papers is illeagal!
VLADIMIR I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.
VLADIMIR Providded you have enough money to pay for this service.
ANYA Well, I don't have any money .
VLADIMIR Good day!
Vladimir pats her on the head and walks away.
ANYA I have a bike!
ANYA Perhaps I could sell it and.
Vladimir keeps walking, catching up to Dmitri.
Anya runs back around to the front of the building where she left her bike.
She stops suddenly when she realizes that there is no bicycle there anymore - just Meetoo.
ANYA (CONT.) What are you doing here?
ANYA (CONT.) And where's my bike?
A POLICEMAN strolls by.
ANYA (CONT.) Officer!
ANYA (CONT.) My bike has been stolen!
POLICEMAN Nonsense.
POLICEMAN There is no crime in the Soviet Socialist Republic.
And he keeps walking.
Anya realizes that there is no hope in pursuing the policeman so she heads off to find Vladimir - who has vanished down the street.
Meetoo starts to follow her.
ANYA Sorry, boy, I have to go.
Meetoo barks "retu" and starts after her.
ANYA (CONT.) No.
ANYA (CONT.) You can't come with me.
ANYA (CONT.) I'm leaving.
Meetoo barks his "retu" and starts after her again.
ANYA (CONT.) It sounds like you're saying "me too".
ANYA (CONT.) Listen little guy, I have money, no food.
ANYA (CONT.) and no bicycle.
ANYA (CONT.) I'm the last person you should be following!
Anya pats him on the head and heads off in the direction of Vlad and Dmitri.
Meetoo, of course, follows her.
Anya spots Vladimir and Dmitri turning the corner in the distance.
Anya runs, trying to catch up with them.
She turns the corner and STOPS.
ANYA'S POV the PALACE in the distance, only now it's run down, boarded up and partially burned.
Anya is taken back.
She stares, fascinated by it - moved by it .
As the sun sets behind the Palace, it's bathed in a beautiful golden light.
CLOSE on a roaring fire, over which Vladimir has fasioned a roatating "spit" which is propelled by a Victrola.
Vladimir is carefully basting the only thing on the spit: a head of cabbage.
Dmitri is sitting by the window, staring at the MUSIC BOX that Anastasia dropped the night of the revolution.
VLADIMIR even if we find her, what makes you think the Empress will even see us?
Dmitri holds up the music box.
DMITRI She'll see us.
Anya approaches, tentative and glancing around.
She tries to open the door but it won't budge, so she moves to a boarded up window.
She looks through a crack in a board.
Dark and eerie.
All of it's former glory destroyed.
CAMERA RISES to a partially destroyed CHANDLIER ehere we see BARTOK, the bat who was with Rasputin.
He hangs upside down next to a FEMALE BAT.
He clears his throat - she doesn't respond.
Using his wings, he gives his "hair: a quick grooming.
BARTOK You, uhh.
BARTOK hang here often?
BARTOK "Hang" get it?
BARTOK I said "hang" and we're both, you know, cause we're bats.
BARTOK and, uhhh.
BARTOK what's your sign?
No reaction from FEMALE BAT.
Anya uses a stick to pry off some of the window boards.
We HEAR a crack.
SAME CRACK noises from downstairs just as Vladimir's cabbage falls from the spit into the fire.
DMITRI What was that?
VLADIMIR That was your dinner!
VLADIMIR I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
BARTOK Whatta' ya say we go somewhere - maybe get a bug to eat.
BARTOK Get it?
BARTOK A "bug" to eat, 'cause we're.
FEMALE BAT rolls her eyes in disgust and flaps away.
BARTOK (CONT.) I'm a Gemini.
He hears the SOUND of boards being torn off the window.
Anya climbs into the ballroom.
Meetoo manages to wiggle in after her and follows Anya as she wanders around, spell bound by the faded glory of the palace.
Anya wanders into the partially destroyed room and bends down to inspect half of a broken plate that's lying on the floor.
The instant she touches it, she pulls her hand away as if SHOCKED.
Recovering, she picks it up.
CLOSE ON PLATE painted with decorative dancing Russian bears.
Anya wanders out of the room and to the top of a HUGE STAIRCASE which leads down to the once grand BALLROOM.
She stops at a large landing half way down the steps.
Meetoo sees a large curtain hanging precariously on the side wall.
Being a puppy he can't resist leaping and grabbing at it with his teeth.
Anya notices and runs her hand along a the carved butterflies in the worn banister.
ON ANYA who jumps, startled, as Meetoo pulls the curtain and it hits the floor.
Dmitri and Vladimir look up from their burnt cabbage.
They heard it too.
Anya is relieved to see it is only Meetoo, who wags his tail happily with the curtain still in his mouth.
ANYA What are you do.
Anya STOPS mid sentence, taken by what she sees.
Behind the curtain was the FRIEZE of the ROMANOV FAMILY.
The moonlight hits the portrait with a ghostly glow.
<u>"ONCE UPON A DECEMBER" (THE MUSIC BOX THEME)</u>
Anya is mesmerized by the FRIEZE.
She looks around the Ballroom.
almost remembering something.
As she sings the ballroom transform into it's once spledid glory.
Anya takes off her coat and at once her rags are transformed into a beautiful gown.
NICHOLAS steps down from the FRIEZE and walks her down the stairs gracefully and begins a waltz with her.
MUSIC BUILDS.
A CHORUS of voices sing the melody as royal ghosts appear as elegant and beautiful as in the opening scene.
Then
Dmitri and Vladimir appear at the top of the stairs.
DMITRI & VLADIMIR'S POV some ragged lunatic dancing with "himself".
Anya is released from Nicholas' embrace.
He kisses her on the forehead and slowly backs away.
She follows Nicholas, back up the stairs to the landing, where the sun has caused a "dust" mist.
Then, magically, TATIANA appears through the mist, a loving beautiful vision from the past.
DMITRI (O.C.) Who are you?!
<u>END NUMBER</u>
Dmitri's voice causes the visage to disintegrate.
All goes back to the way it was - dark and destroyed.
Anya spins toward Dmitri, surprised and frightened.
Anya is caught in a ray of moonlight, directly in front of the image of Anastasia in the frieze.
The resemblance is striking.
Dmitri is taken aback, but Vladimir is unaffected.
VLADIMIR You're trespassing, boy!
Anya is dazed by what has just happened to her and can't quite refocus on reality.
ANYA I.
ANYA I.
ANYA spoke to you earlier about traveling paper.
Dmitri pokes Vladimir with his elbow but doesn't take his eyes off Anya.
DMITRI It's her.
VLADIMIR He's her?
DMITRI Look!
Vladimir looks at Anya again and get it.
ANYA Are you Dmitri?
ANYA I didn't mean to trespass - I don't want to do anything dishonest, but if you could just help help me.
Vladimir and Dmitri walk down the stairs and up her stairs and begin to circle around her.
VLADIMIR Perhaps you heard of our brilliant plan to find a girl and.
Dmitri pokes him hard in the ribs and shakes his head.
DMITRI She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest".
VLADIMIR Ew.
VLADIMIR the honest type.
Dmitri gives Vlad a "let me handle this" gestures.
DMITRI You look like her.
DMITRI Like the Princess Anastasia.
DMITRI Has anyone ever told you that before?
Anya is coming back to her senses, doesn't like these men circling her.
ANYA Oh, yeah - in the orphanage they constantly told me I looked like a princess!
ANYA Stop that!
Dmitri stops circling and then begins to use everything that Anya says - the perfect and charming con man that he is - to get what he wants.
DMITRI People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.
DMITRI That makes her an orphan too
DMITRI (CONT.) What happened to your parents?
ANYA I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution.
DMITRI You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.
DMITRI Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
ANYA I don't know.
ANYA I don't see what this has to do with me.
DMITRI Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember.
VLADIMIR How much do you weigh?
Dmitri pokes him again.
VLADIMIR (CONT.) I was just wondering since we already have the dress.
ANYA Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and.
DMITRI Why do you want to go to Paris?
ANYA I have my reasons.
DMITRI Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.
DMITRI We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris.
DMITRI (CONT.) And I think you are the Princess Anastasia.
Anya laughs.
Vlad mouths to Dmitri "Do you think she's really Anastasia?" Dmitri shakes his head no, of course not, then continues with Anya.
Vlad smiles to himself and walks down the stairs - Dmitri's so good even he got confused!
DMITRI (CON'T) You never thought of the possibility?
ANYA Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on.
ANYA Look at me!
Dmitri spins spins around, dramatically pointing to Anastasia's image in the freeze.
HER! It could be you.
<u>UNDERSCORE: "THE MUSIC BOX THEME"</u>
Anya fiddles with the key around her neck and looks down at the ballroom, remembering what just happened there - could it have been a memory.
Dmitri tries to act casual as he turns and starts walking down the stairs.
DMITRI (CONT.) You don't have anything to lose.
DMITRI (CONT.) If I am wrong - the Empress will simply tell us you aren't Anastasia and we'll be on our way.
DMITRI (CONT.) No harm done - an honest mistake - but at least you <u>will</u> be in Paris.
Anya touches Anastasia's painted hand in the frieze.
Dmitri looks at Anya, her back toward him, as he raises his arm to her.
DMITRI Find out the truth - come to Paris with us.
Anya expression registers her internal debate.
What is it's true.
It coudn't be.
but if.
Then,
ANYA All right.
ANYA I will go with you.
Meetoo let's out his "retu".
Vladimir lets out a whoop of joy.
Dmitri smiles and bows to Anya..
DMITRI The Her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
ON BARTOK having watched the whole thing - he sighs.
BARTOK Oy.
BARTOK he's gonna be so mad.
Bartok flies out a broken window and into the night.
The city lights fade and we move into the blackness of the Russian forest.
Finally, in the distance, we see the orange glow of a fire.
Bartok swoops along the wagons.
Everyone looks to be asleep.
Bartok keeps flying until he sees an OMINOUS LOOKING BLACK WAGON, the largest and most elaborate.
Bartok screws up his courage and flies into the open window of the BLACK WAGON
Dmitri looks at Anya, her back toward him, as he raises his arm to her.
DMITRI Find out the truth - come to Paris with us.
Anya expression registers her internal debate.
What if it's true...
It couldn't be...
but if...
Then,
ANYA All right.
ANYA I will go with you.
Meetoo lets out his "retu".
Vladimir lets out a whoop of joy.
Dmitri smiles and bows to Anya.
DMITRI The Her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
ON BARTOK having watched the whole thing - he sighs.
BARTOK Oy.
BARTOK he's gonna be so mad...
Bartok flies out a broken window and into the night.
The city lights fade and we move into the blackness of the Russian forest.
Finally, in the distance.
we see the orange glow of a fire.
Bartok swoops along the wagons.
Everyone looks to be asleep.
Bartok keeps flying until he sees an ONIOUS LOOKING BLACK WAGON, the largest and most elaborate.
Bartok screws up his courage and flies into the open window of the BLACK WAGON.
A lone candle lights the dark wagon.
A frightened Bartok, stays on the window sill.
BARTOK Ummm ...
BARTOK Father Gregori?
BARTOK It's, uhh ...
BARTOK me.
BARTOK Bartok.
BARTOK Phew!
BARTOK Not home ...
Rasputin's face suddenly ROARS into FRAME from the bed below, his eyes fiery red and his beard wild.
RASPUTIN What?
BARTOK Oh my God!
BARTOK Don't do that ...
BARTOK feel my heart.
BARTOK Go ahead.
BARTOK I'm dying here ...
RASPUTIN And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
Rasputin rises and pours himself a glass of vodka.
BARTOK Name calling!
BARTOK That's mature.
Rasputin grabs him by the throat.
RASPUTIN I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
BARTOK No, I really like my tongue...
BARTOK we're very attached.
BARTOK Oyyyy...
BARTOK Okay, now...
BARTOK promise you won't get angry.
RASPUTIN Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
BARTOK Yeah, right.
BARTOK Keep that thought okay?
BARTOK So, I'm in town, stop by the old palace.
BARTOK You get a better class of bats there - no tattoos or anything.
Rasputin rummages around for a full bottle of vodka, tossing the empties - which Bartok has to dodge.
BARTOK (CONT.) So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and...
BARTOK (CONT.) what can I say, I struck out.
BARTOK (CONT.) I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.
BARTOK (CONT.) Someone's gotta clean that up...
RASPUTIN Get to the point sometime tonight..
RASPUTIN I'm late for a wenching.
BARTOK Okay...
BARTOK you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ...
BARTOK still alive.
He tenses, waiting for Rasputin's explosion but Rasputin just laughs.
RASPUTIN Impossible.
RASPUTIN That rumor's been around for years.
Bartok hovers face-to-face.
BARTOK Trust me, it's her!
RASPUTIN How do you know?
BARTOK Rodent's intuition, how do I know?
BARTOK She looks exactly like her.
BARTOK Except she's taller, which is natural ...
BARTOK Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never grew.
BARTOK Looks like a little pepper shaker.
BARTOK He was so cute ...
Rasputin begins a slow growl that builds.
BARTOK (CONT. ) Oyyy...
BARTOK (CONT. ) I knew this was gonna to upset him!
Rasputin howls in anger and smashes his glass against the wall.
He moves toward the CABINET, knocking over furniture.
Rasputin flings open the cabinet and we see the RELIQUARY, glowing gently as if it were sleeping.
Bartok covers his eyes in fear.
Even Rasputin seem a bit nervous in front of it.
RASPUTIN Source of my power.
RASPUTIN Owner of my soul.
RASPUTIN I need your help.
Rasputin takes the RELIQUARY out of the cabinet and sets it on the table.
BARTOK Hey, she's just a kid.
BARTOK And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
RASPUTIN I cursed then all!
BARTOK My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken".
BARTOK Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
Rasputin pulls out a set of RUSSIAN DOLLS (a small painted.
hollow doll with a smaller doll inside it, and a smaller doll inside it, etc.)
The first doll bears an eerie resemblance to Nicholas.
Inside the second looks like Alexandra, all the way down to the ANASTASIA doll.
<u>"THE END OF THE LINE" (PRODUCTION NUMBER)
Rasputin will have a DARK, MENACING, DELICIOUSLY
SCARY NUMBER in whIch he SINGS of his obsession with killing the Romanovs once and for all.
Bartok will interject comically throughouut.
as Rasputin will conjure up tLis minions from the iquary and sing about Romanovs FINALE, he sends them off after Anya.
SONG TO INCORPORATE THE FOLLOWING SENTIMENTS:</u>
RASPUTIN The Romanovs tried to kill me and I swore to destroy all of them!
RASPUTIN If she lives, if she should have a child someday, the Romanov Family continues!
RASPUTIN And I won't lot that happen!
RASPUTIN THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE!
He crushes the Anastasia doll in his massive hand.
BARTOK You know, this is really obsessive behavior.
BARTOK There is this doctor this doctor in Austria, Sigmund something and he feels.
Bartok land on the table while be's talking and his wing accidently knocks the RELIQUARY on its side and it begins to roll.
Rasputin makes a sad leap, grabbing it seconds before it shatters on the floor.
Rasputin holds it up.
The smokey SPIRITS inside swirl around, moaning.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Yesses - you'd all like to get out, wouldn' t you?
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Sorry just one at a time and only when I call.
Rasputin spins an Bartok, who Us been slinki away, and slams a goblet over his.
From under the glass, Rasputin looks distorted and even more horrifying.
RASPUTIN Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
BARTOK You'd lose your security deposit?
RASPUTIN Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them.
RASPUTIN If they should all be released at once...
RASPUTIN well ...
Rasputin smiles with his horrible yellow, decayed teeth, and lifts the glass an if to whisper in Bartok, a ear.
The volume of Rasputin's voice rattles Bartok around the inside of the glass.
Rasputin focuses on the RELIQUARY.
RASPUTIN (CON'T.) Where is she?
RASPUTIN (CON'T.) Where is Princess Anastasia...
Inside the reliquary the awoke begins to mow Suddenly, the smoke EXPLODES in a burst and forms into the smoke from a train engine.
As the reliquary picture broadens, we see a train and Anya, Dmitri and Vladimir all hurrying to catch it.
RASPUTIN(CONT.) She has friends.
RASPUTIN(CONT.) No matter...
Bartok looks desperate under glass.
He trios to topple the glass prism by jumping up but just cooks his head.
BARTOK Ohhh, that was dumb...
BARTOK (CONT.) Hello, I've get really terrible claustrophobia.
BARTOK (CONT.) That's why I could never live in a cave ...
Rasputin gives his attention only to the reliquary.
RASPUTIN Finish my prophecy...
Smoke begins to pour out of the reliquary.
asput almost giddy with the thought of finishing ambition, laughs hysterically.
BARTOK Ew, I hate when he does this!
As Rasputin swirls his arms the smoke begins to form into MINIONS.
All look human at first, but then we see MINION ONE, has the body of a human and a head of a JACKAL, MINION TWO has the face of a woman and the claws of a TIGER, and MINION- the most horrible of all - has a huge bear-like body with the head of a VULTURE.
All wear long capes with hoods.
RASPUTIN She is not to get off that train...
RASPUTIN alive!
Rasputin kicks open the wagon door and leaps outside.
The MINIONS, still filling out into forms, follow.
One of the wisps of smoke, like a tail, swishes by and knocks over Bartok's glass prism, freeing his.
Rasputin releases his BLACK HORSES who stoup -and whinny, men ing something bad, as two Minions float on to them the other flies ahead of than.
RASPUTIN Go!
RASPUTIN I don't care what you do with the others but finish the girl!
RASPUTIN KILLLLL HERRRRR!
RASPUTIN And have fun...
The Minions take off.
Rasputin laughs wildy.
<u>END MUSICAL NUMBER</u>
TATIANA'S HANDS covering her face.
Slowly dropping her hands down to reveal an older, sad TATIANA.
TATIANA Take her away, Sophie.
PULL BACK to reveal a YOUNG WOMAN standing in front of bar desk.
TATIANA Haven't anything better to do than to break my heart.
Sophie ushers the now ashamed YOUNG WOMAN to the door.
The YOUNG WOMAN looks amazing like Anya except that her hair is long and her clothes are now.
She walks with a certain regal grace until she passes through the doorway - out of Tatiana's sight - and her posture "question-marks" and she lopes out.
TATIANA (CONT.) No more.
TATIANA (CONT.) So more...
Sophie.
heavier and larger bottomed than ten years earlier, speaks quickly - without ev er breathing, in a high pitched nervous chitter.
SOPHIE Oh, oh...
SOPHIE I must say.
SOPHIE I thought that one was bar - i'm just so shocked that she wasn't real well, she was real, I mean she was human, of course.
SOPHIE but not our real.
SOPHIE I must say, even my sisters were touched by her yes - yes they were...
XENIA and ESTELLE, as pinched and skinny as Sophie in "full", don't appear to ever have been "touched" by anything (or anyone).
SOPHIE (CONT.) ...
SOPHIE (CONT.) moved to tears of joy!
SOPHIE (CONT.) We won't be f ooled next time, girls!
SOPHIE (CONT.) I'm a going to think of really hard questions...
TATIANA No, Sophie.
TATIANA My heart can't take it anymore!
TATIANA I will see no more girls claiming to be Anastasia.
Tatiana walks sadly out of the room.
Anya and Metoo doze near a fire along with the other PEASANTS waiting for the train.
Dmitri looks over Vladimir's shoulder nervously watching his forging their travel papers.
DMITRI Hurry up with those papers.
VLADIMIR Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
Vladimir looks at Dmitri's anxious face.
VLADIMIR (CONT.) You probably would.
VLADIMIR (CONT.) They're still wet.
A TRAIN WHISTLE SLOWS and Vlad Moves to Anya.
VLADIMIR (CONT.) Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
DMITRI "Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
VLADIMIR What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
Dmitri leans over and tugs Anya's hair lightly.
DMITRI Wake up!
Anya's eyes flash open and - totally on reflex - she belts Dmitri in the nose.
Ditri reels back, lands on his butt - Vladimir observes ruefully.
VLADIMER We have a lot of work to do...
Vladimir, using his ample belly, bumps people out of the way as they head for the train.
Vlad climbs on just as it starts up, followed by Dmitri.
Dmitri turns back and reaches out his hand to help Anya up.
But she freezes...
just STANDS THERE, not running.
DMITRI Come on!
Dmitri on the train, his band extended - just like Tatiana's was.
Although Anya can't quite remember, something about this terrifies bar.
She snaps out of it when Meetoo nips her ankle.
Anya looks down and sees the puppy, picks his up and runs for the train.
DMITRI Take my hand!
Anya puts Meetoo into his hands and Jumps on without touching his.
The compartment is JAMMED with travelers.
Suitcases and packages balanced precariously.
Dmitri sits down and carefully touches his painful noso.
DMITRI Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
ANYA Sorry - it's a reflex.
ANYA Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
DMITRI I wasn't bothering you.
DMITRI I was trying to wake you up!
OVER ANYA'S SHOULDER, out of the window.
we see the THREE MINIONS on horseback charging down a snow covered hill toward the train.
ANYA By pulling my hair?!
DMITRI I was all out of dynamite!
Dmitri touches his nose again.
Anya opens the window and grabs some snow.
WE SEE the minions racing wildly to catch up with the train.
As the scene continues, we see the minions, by one, getting close to the train and then disappear from view - only their riderless horses ride away.
ANYA Put it on your nose.
ANYA For heaven's sake, you're making such a fuss!
Dmitri tries to act very manly as he puts the ice on his nose, but cringes with the cold.
Anya smiles.
ANYA Men are such babies...
An ELDERLY WOMAN loaded with packages cones into the compartment.
Anya immediately rises to help her.
ANYA Here, let me
Dmitri and Vlad both pull her back down.
DMITRI You're a princess...
VLADIMIR Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Anya gives them both a look and helps the woman.
VLADIMIR Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
DMITRI Yes.
DMITRI And I hate that in a woman.
Vlad holds Meotoo, who is enthralled and plays with Vladimir's drooping mustache, like a kitten with a string.
The COMPARTMENT DOOR swings open and an OMINOUS LOOKING GUARD strides in!
GUARD Papers!
Everyone rustles for their papers.
Dmitri confidently pulls out their papers, done in beautiful BLACK ink.
Then, he glances at the PERSON NEXT TO HIM and sees that his papers are done in a bright RED ink.
Dmitri looks over at Vladimir - who has seen the mistake as well.
VLADIMIR It's what I hate about this government - everything in red!
The guard hand papers back to a soulful looking man with a frozen beard.
GUARD Thank you, Comrade Zhivago.
ZHIVAGO Doctor Zhivago.
GUARD approaches Vlad and Dmitri.
VLADIMIR What do we do now?
DMITRI Pray he's color-blind...
Dmitri flashes the Guard a charming smile as he hands over his papers.
Vladimir is nervously playing with his mustache until it stands out straight.
Anya has no idea what's going on.
GUARD wait here.
As the Guard heads out of the compartment, Vlad turns to Dmitri and they exchange an "oh, no" look.
The MINIONS, hoods pulled low, push their way through the PASSENGERS in search of Anastasia.
Dmitri spots the GUARD conferring with the GUARDS over the papers.
Anya pokes bar head out.
ANYA I'm going to stretch my legs
DMITRI That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs (pointing the opposite direction of the guards) ...
DMITRI stretch then that way.
Anya looks at him like he's crazy and walks away.
ANYA I must have hit him harder than I thought...
Dmitri runs back in and grabs his SMALL BACKPACK.
He pulls Vlad, carrying Meetoo, out off the compartment Anya has a load on them as they follow.
The GUARDS burst in, ready for an arrest.
In the background, the hooded Minions pass.
The Guards, seeing empty seats, head back out.
Anya looks out the window as the country side flies by and smiles.
The Guards spot three figures at the far end of the car.
GUARD That's them!
GUARD Come on!
They run after who they think are the fugitives.
The Guard grabs a minion and spins him around.
It's MINION THREE, who comes face-to-beak with him and lets out a HORRENDOUS SCREECH, causing the other Minion to turn around.
The Guards scream and reel backward, pushing and shoving each other to got out of the way
The Minions proceed up the corridor, MINION TWO, spot Anya looking out the window.
He grabs her.
palling her viciously to the other Minions.
She spins around - it isn't Anya - it's a SERIOUSLY UGLY WOMAN.
The Minions now scream and reel back in horror.
Dmitri and Vladimir catch up to Anya and grab her in each arm, loading bar down the hall WE HEAR the MINIONS SCREAM from the next car.
Anya.
Dmitri and Vlad step out on a platform and see there is no place left to run.
Only the engine is ahead of them.
DMITRI Wait here!
He leaps up gracefully, grabbing the edge of the roof, and pull& himself up.
ANYA Would you like to tell what we are...
as Dmitri's head, upside down, appears from the roof.
DMITRI Come on up!
ANYA Why?
Vladimir picks Anya from up from tobehind and hoists her up to Dmitri.
She hollers.
Anya is pulled up by Dmitri, with a force that knocks them both over Anya on top.
An awkward moment.
Anya rolls off him as Dmitri tries to catch the breath she knocked out of him.
ANYA Just what do you think you're doing?!
DMITRI Trying...
DMITRI to...
DMITRI breathe...
Suddenly, Meetoo appears, as if he were flying and lots out a little "retu".
Vladimir has tossed his up and Dmitri catches his, band his to Anya, and reaches down to Vladimir.
Though the window the Minions see Vladimir's legs as he's being lifted.
INT.
ROOF oF TRAIN
Dmitri struggles to got Vlad to the roof but he's losing his grasp.
Anya puts Meetoo down and reaches to help the dangling Vlad.
Even Meetoo helps by pulling an Vladimir's scarf .
Minion one grabs for Vladimir's legs, just as they disappear.
Dmitri and Anya let out a sigh of relief as Vlad in safe, but it's short lived as they both SIMULTANEOUSLY lot out a yell.
a TUNNEL rapidly approaching.
They hit the deck, Vlad on his back between Anya and Dmitri.
Anya and Dmitri exchange a quick look as the tunnel gets closer - Vladimir's stomach is sticking up too high to clear the tunnel.
They reach up together and push down on his big belly, causing his eyes to bulge
The minions, now climbing up the side are plunged into total darkness.
ON THE ROOF light hits as the train comes out of the tunnel.
Vlad lets out a gasp as they release his belly.
Just then a Minion hand reaches up over the edge.
Dmitri assumes it's a Guard.
DMITRI The guards!
DMITRI I'll explain later.
Anya and Vlad follow Dmitri toward the back of the train.
ON THE MINIONS now on the roof, seeing their prey in short distance.
ON ANYA AND THE OTHERS running, without looking back.
jumping from car to car, passing Meetoo like a football.
Vladiair makes a huge running leap into the air...
As all PASSENGERS react to Vladimir's bulk hitting and denting the coiling.
The TRAIN WHISTLE erupts and Anya glances back to see her pursuers just as they are enveloped in the thick black smoke of the engine.
Behind them, Anya can another tunnel.
They drop down, this time Vlad in on his stomach.
Anya and Dmitri realize his butt won't clear the tunnel.
They push it down.
An the smoke disappears, the Minions' eyes go wide when they realize it's too late for them.
The train roars the tunnel as the MINIONS SMASH &"'not the sift of
the mountain in a COLORFUL BURST OF SMOKE from which they were created.
Rasputin stares at the scene in his reliquary, watching his well laid plan *go up in smoke", and lots out a simmering growl.
Anya is standing with her hands an her hips arguing with Dmitri and Vladiair.
ANYA Forged papers!
ANYA Now, what?!
DMITRI Now just get off the train.
Dmitri motions that they are going to Jump.
Anya shakes her head slowly.
ANYA Noooo....
VLADIMIR She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
Dmitri shoves him off the top of the train with Meetoo in his arm.
Dmitri then puts out his hand to Anya.
DMITRI Come on, we'll jump together...
DMITRI Take my hand.
Dmitri turns forward and sees the train is approaching a HIGH RAILROAD BRIDGE over a rocky ravine.
It's now or never.
DMITRI Come on!
ANYA No!
With his outstretched hand, Dmitri shoves her off the bar.
Vladimir has landed in a large pile of snow.
He stands, rubbing his bottom.
VLADIMIR I think I have hurt my...
Meetoo comes out of the pile of leaves, rubbing his bottom and answers Vladimir's with his "retu".
A short distance away, Anya seems to be sitting on top of a puddle - but she isn't wet.
Suddenly, Dmitri gets up from underneath her, covered in snow.
Anya isn't wet because she landed on Dmitri!
She jumps up.
DMITRI You must enjoy causing me pain!
ANYA You shouldn't have pushed us!
Vladimir and Meetoo come over.
VLADIMIR Is everyone all right?
ANYA I'm fine.
DMITRI She's fine!
DMITRI I may never walk right again, but she's fine...
Rasputin paces, still angry at the Minions.
Bartok, nervous, fakes a yawn and stretches.
Well, I better got goin'.
Got a busy day letting all the blood rush to my head...
Rasputin pulls him back in, then speaks to his reliquary.
RASPUTIN She's too far away, isn't she?
The reliquary glows eyes.
Rasputin places It back in it's cabinet.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Yesss...
RASPUTIN (CONT.) our power is much stronger when were near.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) We must get close to her.
BARTOK Oy...
BARTOK not a road trip.
BARTOK I get wagon sick, you know that.
Rasputin smacks him against the wall as he stomps out of the wagon.
Bartok slides down the wall.
BARTOK (CONT.) You're absolutely right.
BARTOK (CONT.) Travel broadens your horizons...
And he hits the floor.
Rasputin, on his obsessed mission, leaps on top of the wagon as Bartok, still dizzy, tries to catch up.
RASPUTIN We'll catch her and finish her!
RASPUTIN We ride this night!
Rasputin then looks down and sees that there are no horses harnessed he gave then to the begins a slow growl.
BARTOK Well, we wait this night!
Anya is walking ahead with Vladiair as Dmitri follows he's still muddy, wet and unhappy.
VLADIMIR No have a lot of work to do, Anya!
VLADIMIR Come along, Meetoo!
Meetoo is trying to catch fire flies in his mouth.
VLADIMIR (CONT.) We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
ANYA Who's Sophie?
VLADIMIR Ah ...
VLADIMIR the Lady Sophie...
VLADIMIR The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress.
VLADIMIR We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ...
VLADIMIR your grandmother, I mean.
Anya stops dead in her tracks, this is the first she's heard of this.
ANYA What?!
Dmitri, not paying attention, slams into the back of Anya.
Anya, not hurt, turns to Dmitri - who is rubbing his now sore shoulder.
ANYA (CONT.) You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
DMITRI You are the Princess.
VLADIMIR We're just going to refresh your memory...
ANYA I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!
ANYA Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it.
ANYA I'm not exactly...
Anya searches for the -word as she sits down next to a frozen pond.
ANYA (CONT.) ...
ANYA (CONT.) good enough...
ANYA (CONT.) I can't go through with this!
Dmitri sits next to Anya and looks at her reflection in the ice.
DMITRI What do you see?
ANYA'S POV her smudged face and boy's clothes.
Dmitri's hands come into frame, wipe off her face with snow and them pull her hair off her face.
Anya does, truly, look pretty.
DMITRI(CONT.) See?
DMITRI(CONT.) The Princess is under there ...
VLADIMIR Ah!
VLADIMIR Let us begin!
<u>A POSSIBLE VLADIMIR SONG
Vladimir would begin to sing here, telling Anya that she has a lot to learn.
The music would probably have a LIGHT, SOMEWHAT COMEDIC tone, and would be just a SHORT SECTION OF SINGING, which would then SEGUE TO UNDERSCORE for the scenes of instruction which follow.
We see the three of them from behind, walking down a road - Meetoo trots behind them, happily.</u>
VLADIMIR (CONT.) You were born on the Adriatic sea at the summer palace, where the parties and the buffets were marvelous ....
Vladimir is putting icicles in Anya's hair to keep it up in a bun - she looks sweet, despite her boy's clothes.
She is reciting something to Dmitri.
ANYA ...and on my father's side, there was [THIS SECTION IS NOT LEDGABLE]
Anya thinks as Dmitri looks at a long sheet of paper, prompting her.
DMITRI Every Russian family has one..
ANYA Natasha!
ANYA Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
VLADIMIR Did I tell you that?
ANYA You must have.
Anya, Dmitri and Vladimir are sitting in the back of a pig cart traveling down a country road.
The pigs are very interested as Anya is pointing to different pieces of hay which "set" her imaginary table.
ANYA ...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and.
DMITRI It's the best fork of all
ANYA The dessert fork!
VLADIMIR Ah, yes ...
VLADIMIR I have always loved that fork...
Dmitri and Anya exchange a look and then laugh, adding ad libs of "we can tell" and "There's a fork you should have skipped".
This is the first time Dmitri and Anya have laughed together - actually the first time he's ever seen her smile.
Dmitri, who is sneaking around, pulling women's clothes out of a suitcase that clearly isn't theirs!
He takes out a large, but pretty dress, a beautiful veil - and a huge brassiere, which he quickly stuffs back in the suitcase - somewhat frightened.
He takes the dress and veil puts it in his backpack and joins Vladimir and Anya as they admire the ship.
ANYA What a beautiful ship!
DMITRI It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
VLADIMIR Oh, yes it was the seagoing vessel of elaborate elegance in entertaining...
VLADIMIR A party boat.
VLADIMIR It once belonged to ...
Vladimir honestly can't remember, Anya thinks it's another quiz.
ANYA Konstantin Petrovich of Moscow!
Dmitri and Vladimir exchange a quizzical look.
No one told her that...
Meetoo spots TWO UGLY PUG DOGS and a distinguished ELDERLY DOWAGER.
He runs happily to play with them.
She pulls her DOGS away from Meetoo.
ELDERLY DOWAGER No, no, boys!
ELDERLY DOWAGER You don't know where he's been!
They give him a disgusted look and walk away.
Meetoo looks a little hurt.
Dmitri and Vladimir are standing by a closed door.
Anya is on the other side.
ANYA (0. C.) No!
ANYA (0. C.) I look ridiculous!
VLADIMIR Come out!
VLADIMIR I can do alterations.
ANYA (O.C.) You'll laugh.
VLADIMIR I shant!
ANYA (O.C.) Not you.
ANYA (O.C.) Him.
DMITRI I won't laugh - I swear...
The door opens and Anya comes out in the blue dress Dmitri stole which at least ten sizes too big for her.
She is still wearing her hair up and despite the size which actually gives her a "Kate Moss" waifish look with her men's boots and baggy dress - the blue brings out her eyes.
Dmitri sees her and BUSTS OUT LAUGHING.
ANYA You said you wouldn't laugh!
DMITRI It's not you - it's the dress!
Anya storms back into the cabin and slam the door behind her.
When Anya storms into the cabin, she catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror.
ANYA I'm never going to be..
Just then, the slamming door catches the back of her dress, pulling more than half of it into the door frame.
She sees in the mirror that the now fitted dress shows a lovely woman's figure.
Pleased, she looks at herself.
ANYA (CONT.) Well!
ANYA (CONT.) Maybe I am...
Vladimir and Dmitri wait outside the door.
The door opens and Anya appears, having tied the veil around the waist of the dress, making it look fitted and beautiful.
Dmitri and Vladimir are surprised as Anya walks past them with confidence and throws them a look over her shoulder.
<u>"REPRISE OF VLADIMIR'S SONG (OVER MONTAGE)
The tone of the song would now change - - the older, wiser person watching as two younger people are unwittingly falling in love.
The tone can still be light, as are the visuals here, but there would be an undercurrent of irony and romance.
The song would end as Anya and Dmitri have their first, momentary embrace.</u>
ON DECK: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully down the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion.
Dmitri and Vlad can't even stand due to the motion.
Anya looks back and flashes them a smile.
IN THEIR CABIN: Dmitri gets out of the bed he's been sharing with Vlad and walks over, past where Anya is sleeping peacefully, to close the port hole against a cold wind.
He closes is and see's Anya - she looks beautiful - he bends down to pull up her covers and she SLUGS him.
UNDER A TABLE: Meetoo is walking around sniffing feet.
Suddenly, he runs smack into the TWO UGLY PUG DOGS who growl at him.
He runs away and finally see's a woman's foot and a pair of pretty feminine shoes, with heels, that she has kicked off.
Meetoo grabs them in his mouth and runs.
ON DECK: The sea is calm, but Anya - wearing the heeled shoes for the first time - is teetering and wobbling like mad.
Dmitri and Vlad watch her with amusement.
Anya turns to them.
ON DECK: Dmitri has stuffed his feet into the woman's shoes and is barely able to walk as Anya watches him with great vindication.
BALLROOM: Anya walks -into the ballroom, steady and graceful in her new shoes, on Vladimir's arm and completes a perfect curtsy in front of Dmitri.
Dmitri applauds and moves down to her as she stands and smacks him with her head accidently.
THEIR CABIN: Vladimir is directing Anya as she waltzes gracefully in their swaying cabin.
Dmitri enters and is directed to join Anya.
He does and they dance together, with Anya clearly leading.
The boat sways to the left and Anya is thrown closer into Dmitri's arms.
Neither of them even try to readjust.
Vladimir walks over to Anya and nervously chatters (he knows he interrupted something) as he leads her away from Dmitri.
VLADIMIR You are a natural!
VLADIMIR I don't know how you ever learned to dance that well!
VLADIMIR That must have been some high class orphanage ...
As a storm begins to whip up, the wind starts to howl and the waves become more violent.
REVERSE ANGLE just as a BOLT OF LIGHTNING STRIKES the water, we see Rasputin's face.
The storm is pitching the boat wildly.
Vladimir is sleeping, snoring loudly.
Meetoo, sound asleep, is sliding from side of the cabin to the other.
Anya is looking out the small port hole at the violent sea when Dmitri, carrying his back pack, sits on the bed next to her.
DMITRI I wanted to show you something.
Dmitri takes out the music box and hands it to Anya.
She is immediately taken by it, something about it ...
ANYA It's so beautiful ...
ANYA and sad.
DMITRI Sad?
ANYA Lost.
ANYA it feels lost.
ANYA This was hers?
DMITRI Yeah ...
DMITRI well, yours.
DMITRI You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
ANYA I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess?
ANYA It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it!
You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
I'm sorry.
Hey!
It doesn't matter!
You gotta make your own way in the world!
Don't be sorry for me!
I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
Dmitri goes back over to his bed.
Anya sees through him and knows how much it all did matter to him.
The wagon sits on the edge of a high cliff.
Rasputin stands on the top of his wagon, staring at the sea demonically.
The jagged bolts of lightening and the icy silver rain make him look all the more menacing.
She's out there ...
The wind parts his beard and we see Bartok hanging upside down in it, trying to stay out of the storm.
I'm getting a chest cold..
Bartok...
a question.
I'm getting pneumonia.
I have a fever.
Feel my forehead...
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
Rasputin's eyes light up as if he just thought of the answer to his own question.
Bartok is thrown out of his beard when he makes a sudden turn and leaps off the wagon.
Bartok follows.
My cousin Mischa, nice fellow had some dental problems - you didn't want to watch him eat, let's put it that way...
Rasputin steps in
As Bartok continues, Rasputin moves to the reliquary's cabinet.
...
anyway, a bunch of other bats were hanging in the belfry - I know, cliche, but there you have it, and Mischa, not the brightest bat in the world, decides to hang <u>in</u> the bell.
Which was fine for awhile until it started ringing ...
Ewwww, what a mess ...
Show her to me ...
And it didn't help the tonal quality of the bell, either.
IMAGES, horrifying and frightening, begin to spin into a small tornado.
Rasputin throws open the door and the TORNADO bursts out streaking across the water.
Rasputin follows tornado to the cliff and watches as it disappears into the horizon of the water.
Lightning and thunder crash as he laughs maniacally.
INT.	CABIN - NIGHT which is swaying with the storm.
PAN past Vladimir, snoring, his now limp mustache flopping wildly and past Dmitri, sleeping restlessly.
Move to Anya, who seems quite content.
From under the door SMOKY IMAGES silently slither.
They float across the cabin and swirl around Anya.
Anya's CLOSED EYES as the SMOKY IMAGES seem to enter her head.
She smiles in her sleep and we are in ANYA'S
Anya, in a beautiful white dress, is walking peacefully through a sunny part of a lovely forest on a spring day.
She reaches down to pick some pretty flowers, then looks up as it seems to get dark...
OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUDS cover the sun.
Anya reaches down for another flower when she
Anya spins to see an ENORMOUS BEAR emerge from the trees.
(All the animals in the dream sequence have a SLIGHT resemblance to Rasputin.)
Anya is frozen with fear as MORE BEARS emerge and head straight for her.
She tries to back away as the beautiful FLOWERS GROW LONG AND HORRIBLE THORNS and wrap around her ankles, impeding her escape.
It gets darker as the BEAR'S EYES, glowing yellow, multiply and move closer.
Anya pulls free of the flowers and rushes to the safety of a large tree She climbs the tree and escapesthe bears.
Looking down, from her perch on a sturdy branch, the ground seems miles away.
Suddenly, the BRANCH JOLTS her and almost falling, she hold on to it tightly.
But the branch TURNS IN TOWARD
HER - no longer a tree branch, but A HUGE UGLY SNAKE with red eyes and huge fangs that come right for her!
Anya leaps to another branch, which also turns into a snake.
She jolts backward and begins to fall ...
toward a HUNDRED
TEETH.
As Anya falls, she lets out a SILENT SCREAM.
A BURST OF SUNLIGHT as Anya lands in a field of soft GOLDEN WHEAT.
Unharmed and very relieved, she stands and looks around at the beautiful sunny wheat field.
Reality.
Anya's eyes are closed as she smiles in her sleep and sits up in bed.
TINY WISPS of smoke still swirl around her head.
As she gets out of bed, she unintentionally steps on Meetoo's tail, waking him.
Meetoo watches as the sleeping Anya opens the cabin door and walks out.
Meetoo rises to follow Anya but the ship pitches, sending him sliding across the cabin floor.
Anya walks out on the deck, the ship pitching violently in the storm, as she smiles.
Anya is walking through the wheat field to the edge of a BLUFF.
A few yards below the bluff, Anya sees a beautiful little pond where a FAMILY frolic's in the clear water; laughing, splashing, swiming happily.
Anya climbs over a low flowering wall to look closer.
REALITY: Anya has climbed over the railing of the deck and is looking into the black ocean...
smiling.
It's RASPUTIN'S POV as he watches his plan unfold in the reliquary.
Meetoo finally rights himself from his slide across the floor and begins to bark into Dmitri's ear.
Anya is waving happily at the dangerous water.
Anya is waving to the FAMILY.
They turn around toward her and she sees that it's the ROMONOV FAMILY, from the frieze that she saw in the palace.
She is delighted to see them as she feels a distance recollection of who they are to her.
Meetoo jumps up and NIPS at Dmitri's hand.
Dmitri leaps up with an "owwww!" and looks over at the excited Meetoo.
If you have to go - wake her..
Dmitri looks over to Anya's bed - she isn't sits up and throws his legs over the side
Anya is standing right on the edge of death...
She isn't there.
He of his bed.
the FAMILY is waving to her.
NICHOLAS waves for her to jump into the clear pond and join them.
Anya nods and moves to jump in...
Anya gets ready to jump into the violent and icy black waves.
She takes one step out when...
DMITRI GRABS HER
Anya JOLTS awake from her dream.
Confused at first, then terrified to see what almost happened to her.
isn't lifts her to the other side of the railing and looks at her.
What were you doing?!
Anya puts her hands to her mouth in shock, shaking and almost crying with fear, she throws her arms around Dmitri and holds him tightly.
Dmitri is surprised at first, but tightens his arms around her.
It's okay now - I've got you.
You're safe...
They stand steady on the deck in a tight embrace, their feelings for each other are stronger than the storm.
THE SAME, as seen through the reliquary
Rasputin watches ...
seething quietly, as Bartok peeks meekly over his shoulder.
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
She leads a charmed life, that little one ...
Someone is always there to save her.
In the palace as a child, on the train and now ...
it's him.
Rasputin studies Dmitri in the reliquary - Dmitri and Anya still in a warm embrace.
Nice looking fellow.
I mean, don't get me wrong - I'm not attracted to him in the physical sense, I just ...
But Rasputin's not interested, he stares into the reliquary and speaks directly to it.
You are toying with me, aren't you?
You let me get so close...
The reliquary, as if in answer, seem to be chuckling.
Rasputin smiles and joins in with it.
Bartok ...
have you ever been to Paris?
Me?
No.
Rich food - it kills me.
Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Rasputin returns the reliquary to its cabinet.
We are going to Paris - and while we're there, let's kill the young man.
He annoys me.
As Anya walks down the plank her dress gets caught on a nail.
Dmitri is walking toward her as she yanks her dress free and accidentally punches him in the stomach.
Dmitri takes it like a man.
Oh!
I'm sorry...
It's okay.
Didn't hurt..
Vlad has been watching as he walks down the plank with Meetoo - they exchange an "oh boy" look, both noticing that clearly something is different between Anya and Dmitri.
Anya catches something out of the corner of eye and turns quickly.
CLOSE ON a sign: "Paris 30 kilometers"
Anya walks away from Dmitri and over to the sign and looks at it longingly.
I'm almost there...
I'm finally going to know...
Vladimir stares into his purse, depressed.
How is our current financial status?
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
As he says this the ELDERLY DOWAGER from the ship passes by with her TWO OBNOXIOUS PUG DOGS.
Meetoo growls as Vlad and Dmitri get an idea.
The "Odessa Dunk"?
It worked in Odessa...
Vladimir picks up Meetoo and whispers instructions.
Meetoo likes the plan.
NEW ANGLE as Meetoo races past the PUGS.
They ignore him, so he stops and makes a face, giving them a sloppy "razzberry", which piques them a little.
Meetoo then bends over and waves his furry little butt at them.
Now the PUGS are offended and TAKE OFF after him, yapping all the way.
Meetoo turns and scrambles with the Pugs in hot pursuit.
As they get closer, Meetoo SUDDENLY STOPS and the Pugs go FLYING OFF they edge of the dock and into the water below.
Meetoo looks over the edge and gives them a 'Boy, are you guys morons look as the ELDERLY DOWAGER runs up screaming.
Help!
My little dogs!
Chevalier!
Maurice!
Hold on, darlings!
Dmitri comes running up, a little too gallant.
I'll save them, Madame
Dmitri dives into the water as Vlad rushes up behind the Elderly Dowager.
Anya watches from a distance as Dmitri climbs out of the water carrying the soaked (and pissed) Pugs.
Such bravery!
Why, that man should be rewarded!
Amply rewarded!
Dmitri hands Vlad a pile of FRANCS as Anya approaches.
That was really very kind of you.
She gives him a kiss on the cheek and walks away with Meetoo, who turns back and gives Dmitri a look.
A little guilty, Dmitri turns to Vlad.
I won't say a word...
Traveling is style!
Vladimir is driving - badly - with Meetoo in the front seat.
Meetoo covers his eyes.
Dmitri and Anya are in the open back seat, enjoying the beautiful French countryside.
Dmitri looks over at Anya.
Nervous?
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
You'll convince her.
You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong...
and beautiful ...
even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
Anya smiles at Dmitri, knowing that all the confidence she has is because of him.
She takes his hand but looks away.
They pull up in front of the beautiful white house.
Anya is nervous as Vladimir walks up to the front door ahead of Dmitri and Anya.
Vladimir knocks.
Sophie answers the door.
She moves with grace and regal poise.
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Oh good!
We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
Anya looks to Dmitri, a little confused by that last comment.
Dmitri makes a little "she's slightly crazy" signal.
They all leap to avoid her butt as she bustles into the house.
Sophie, flanked by her sisters, sits at a table.
Anya, looking nervous but poised, sits across while Dmitri and Vladimir hover nervously at the far end of the room.
Sophie's PAT CAT, TILLIE, attempts to cuddle up next to Meetoo, who wants nothing to do with her.
I'd just like to ask you a few questions, dear...
Sophie opens a huge book that SLAMS open.
Vlad and Dmitri jump.
Of course.
Where were you born?
Dmitri watches Anya answer questions gracefully and without hesitating.
Anya smiles as her answers begin to surprise Sophie.
The real Anastasia couldn't have grown up to be lovelier.
Sophie and the sisters look tired.
Sophie has her last question.
This is the hard one ...
what rare treat was served on the night of the Three Hundredth Anniversary of the Romanov Dynasty?
The last ball they ever had?
Dmitri and Vladimir exchange a nervous look.
It's obvious they never briefed Anya on this one.
Anya thinks a moment, then looks up, smiling, as she remembers ...
Father had fresh tropical fruits sent in.
Oranges and pineapples from the far east.
I remember ...
I remember I threw an orange to a young boy who was hiding under a table...
Dmitri is shocked.
He know this is Anastasia Romonov and he can't believe it.
Yes ...
yes, it was fresh fruit.
Well, maybe not "fresh" Estelle got one rather brown banana but ...
Dmitri, as he stares at Anya as Sophie prattles on.
Anya sits near the window, stroking Tillie ...
much to the consternation of a jealous Meetoo., She looks out the window and sees Dmitri, deep in thought, wandering in the garden.
OUT OF HER EARSHOT at the other end of the room, Vladimir speaks to Sophie.
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Oh, heavens I must say...
no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Perhaps you could convince her?
Oh, heavens, no...
but ...
(Vlad-leans closer as Sophie shares a naughty secret) She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight!
That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French...
they only go to see which dancers will defect.
She rises heading towards Anya.
Her butt knocks over a vase, which Vladimir deftly catches.
Come my dear, we've much to talk about.
Vladimir has finished giving Dmitri the details.
Both are ecstatic.
We did it!
We did it, my boy!
We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich!
Rich!
But it's not the money, Vlad.
Are you feeling all right?
But you never doubted who I was, did you, Dmitri?
Not for a second ...
Anya gratefully kisses Dmitri an the cheek and runs into the house.
Vladimir, who's been watching, has a warning.
Life is funny, isn't it.
You find the right girl ...
and then you lose her.
What do you mean?
Dmitri ...
You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana...
well, it's over...
nothing can happen between you.
She's a princess and you're a commoner.
Dmitri understands this and is devastated.
Vladimir pats him on the back as he walks into the house.
Anya and Dmitri, followed by Vlad and Sophie are walking down the Champs Elysees.
Meetoo trots along after them, happily.
They walk by AN ACCORDION PLAYER and a LADY FLOWER SELLER, who watch them and whisper to each other.
ACCORDION PLAYER Lovers!
FLOWER SELLER Ooh la la!
In UPTEMPO "PARIS IN THE TWENTIES style MUSIC, the people of Paris ALL SING, welcoming Anya and Dmitri, Sophie and Vlad, to Paris!
The foursome explores the city and Anya has the happiest day of her young life.
On the streets they encounter the motley denizens of Paris, as well as people with very familiar faces -- for anyone in the audience in the know, they'll see Josephine Baker, Maurice Chevalier, Rodin, Gertrude Stein, Freud, Lindbergh - people who were in Paris in the twenties..
For those in the audience who don't recognize them, they'll simply be unidentified fascinating "types" who SING.
As the joyous number progresses, we realize that Dmitri is feeling something else -- the impending loss of Anya to a world where she clearly is at home.
He SINGS for a short moment, knowing that he's about to lose her.
Anya visits a couturier and comes out with a big dress box for her evening at the ballet.
A BIG FINALE as they go off for the evening.
Even Meetoo has found some female poodle companionship.
But for one last beat, Dmitri's wistfulness cuts against joy.
A glorious sunset over the city of lights ...
PAN DOWN to the "other side of the tracks, a run down area next to the Seine River.
Rasputin's wagon is parked on the edge.
Bartok freshens himself up in front of the mirror as he
RASPUTIN (O.C.) Shut up!
NEW ANGLE showing Rasputin trying to concentrate on the reliquary.
BARTOK Sorry, it's just...
BARTOK you know I saw these french postcards once and...
BARTOK ooh la la ...
BARTOK well, I'm not sure about the "ooh", but it's the "la la" I'm really lookin' forward to...
BARTOK Right, I'm shutting up.
Rasputin leans closer to the reliquary, which now contains the BRIGHTEST COLORS we've seen.
The reliquary sits in it's cabinet.
RASPUTIN We're close to her, aren't we?
The reliquary BRIGHTENS even more, looking as if it could burst.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Excited, eh?
RASPUTIN (CONT.) You look about to burst ...
RASPUTIN (CONT.) You'd like to burst, wouldn't you?
The lightsin the reliquary shake, as if to say "yes".
RASPUTIN (CONT.) No, no, no.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) We made a bargain.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Someday you'll have me for all eternity.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Till then...
RASPUTIN (CONT.) I'm in charge.
Rasputin slams the cabinet shut, then turns to see Bartok in front of a mirror.
He wears a smart BLACK BERET which is much too large on him.
BARTOK What do you think?
BARTOK Is it me?
Sweet, small french hotel on a winding cobble stone street of the Left Bank.
Dmitri and Vladimir are both dressed in formal attire and look extremely dapper.
Vlad is delighted with himself, modeling his finery, but Dmitri looks very sad.
VLADIMIR Compliments of Sophie.
VLADIMIR Her escort has to look his best.
They turn as the door opens and Anya stands nervously, but then strikes a regal pose.
She looks magnificent ...
radiant, which is not lost on Dmitri.
ANYA How do I look?
Before Vladimir can gush, Dmitri, forced to repress his true feelings, is a bit curt and rises.
DMITRI Fine.
DMITRI We better go.
Anya looks surprised by his tone, but follows.
As the BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE OF PARIS pull up in carriages and automobiles.
As Dmitri, Vladimir and Anya take their seats, all around them people are whispering "Who's that?", "What a beautiful woman", etc.
The Ballet begins.
Dancers in bright costumes leap across the stage.
Dmitri turns to Anya and gestures to the box seats to the left.
He hands her the opera glasses.
DMITRI Look.
DMITRI There is your grandmother...
Anya gives Dmitri a very nervous look and takes the glasses, aiming them toward Tatiana.
The majestic Tatiana, flanked by Sophie and her sisters and backed by several large GUARDS in uniform.
ANYA She's so beautiful!
ANYA I do remember her ...
ANYA I remember her ...
The music continues as Anya looks at Tatiana.
The lights come up and people around them begin to stand up, stretch, etc.
Dmitri turns to Anya.
DMITRI Come on.
DMITRI It's time..
They approach Tatiana's private box.
DMITRI Wait here for just a moment.
I'll go in first and prepare her.
It's bound to be a shock...
ANYA I'm so scared...
DMITRI Don't be
ANYA And grateful.
ANYA To you.
ANYA If it weren't for you --
DMITRI I know.
Dmitri opens the door into Tatiana's private box.
Anya waits nervously outside.
Dmitri walks up to the guards standing at the top of three small steps into the box seats.
DMITRI I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
TATIANA (CONT.) How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
DMITRI Please, if you'd just listen...
TATIANA Remove him at once.
The guards physically force Dmitri out, in spite of his urgent pleas.
DMITRI Please!
DMITRI Empress!
DMITRI It's not what you ....
Dmitri is thrown out of the box and straight into Anya, who stares at him with tears in her eyes.
She then turns and runs away.
DMITRI Anya.
DMITRI please.
Anya pushes her way through the CROWD with Dmitri in pursuit.
Anya bursts out of the doors followed by Dmitri
DMITRI Anya, wait!
ANYA Tell me it isn't true?!
ANYA Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
DMITRI No!
DMITRI Well, yes, but
ANYA No!
ANYA I thought you believed in me!
ANYA It was all a lie!
Dmitri runs out and stands by grand looking automobiles lined up in front.
He scans the cars.
Tatiana is walking toward her car.
A very proper CHAUFFEUR holds the door for her.
The CHAUFFEUR helps Tatiana in, then is about to climb into the front seat when Dmitri rushes up to him.
DMITRI Sir!
DMITRI Your rear tire is flat!
CHAUFFEUR it is?
As he gets out to look, Dmitri slides into the drivers seat and roars away.
The stunned Chauffeur in his dust.
Tatiana is jolted by the fast motion of her car.
TATIANA Ulo!
TATIANA Slow down!
Dmitri turns from the front seat and looks at her.
DMITRI I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down.
DMITRI But you will listen to me!
TATIANA You!
TATIANA How dare you?!
TATIANA Stop this car immediately!
Tatiana's car flying down small streets.
TATIANA Stop this car!
The car slams to.
a stop in front of the SMALL HOTEL.
Dmitri leans into the back seat, face-to-face with her.
DMITRI Please don't be afraid!
DMITRI I'm sorry, but there was no other way!
Tatiana is frightened, but still very stubborn.
She looks away from him.
Dmitri thrusts the music box into her hands.
DMITRI (CONT.) Look at this!
Tatiana looks down and is immediately taken aback.
TATIANA Anastasia's music box...
TATIANA She had this all these years...
TATIANA You could have found it...
DMITRI What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Tatiana turns away from him again.
DMITRI (CONT.) You were right - it <U>was</U> a lie.
DMITRI (CONT.) My intention was to fool you
DMITRI (CONT.) I am a liar - but I found the truth.
DMITRI (CONT.) Just see her!
DMITRI (CONT.) I swear if you see her I'll disappear forever
Dmitri points up to the open window of the hotel.
DMITRI (CONT.) Just look!
DMITRI (CONT.) Just look at her!
Tatiana finally looks out the window.
Anya holding Meetoo in front of the window.
BACK TO TATIANA reacting to how much she looks like Anastasia.
Anya hears a KNOCK and assumes it is Dmitri.
ANYA Go away!
The door opens slowly.
Anya spins, then softens when she sees Tatiana holding the MUSIC BOX.
TATIANA Who are you, child?
ANYA I don't know!
ANYA I don't want to hurt you...
Tatiana holds out the music box.
TATIANA Do you remember this?
ANYA I remember something lost ...
ANYA I'm so confused!
ANYA Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me!
ANYA Do you think I could have...
ANYA belonged to you ...
Tatiana notices Anya nervously playing with the key around her neck.
Tatiana reacts when she sees the key.
TATIANA Oh!
TATIANA Where did you get that?!
Anya sees her looking at the key around her neck.
ANYA I've always had it...
ANYA I came here because of this!
ANYA Tell me if you recognize it!
ANYA Please!
ANYA It's all I have...
Tatiana holds out her hands as Anya takes off the key and hands it to her.
TATIANA It was hers ...
TATIANA my Anastasia's ...
TATIANA If this is part of your scheme!
TATIANA If you found it or stole - I don't care, I'll give you whatever you want just TELL ME
Anya takes the music box and the key out of Tatiana's hand gently - remembering how it works.
Anya puts in the key and begins to wind it.
Tatiana is surprised that Anya knows how it works - so is Anya!
We hear THE MUSIC BOX begin to play.
Their cracking voices trail off as they look at each other and know that they are who they've been searching for - and the search is finally over.
Tatiana and Anya throw their arms around each other, both crying, both overjoyed.
TATIANA Anastasia!
Anastasia!
You've come home at last!
You've come home ...
Dmitri watches Anya and Tatiana's embrace.
He smiles sadly, then turns and walks down the dark street alone.
Bartok slides his way out to the window ledge.
Overcome with emotion, he is crying big bat tears.
BARTOK He is gonna yellllll.
Hideous fat river rats, ferocious looking and scarred, stop and tremble nervously when
Bartok catapults across the frame, having been thrown out of the window so hard that when he hits the stone wall of the river bank, the stones crack.
BARTOK I should have been a dentist ...
Anya snuggles down into the thick covers as Tatiana strokes her hair gently.
ANYA ...
ANYA and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings!
ANYA I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
TATIANA Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
Anya closes her eyes as Tatiana continues to stroke her hair.
TATIANA (CONT.) My poor child you're safe, now...
TATIANA (CONT.) you're home ...
Anya is asleep as Tatiana kisses her forehead, turns off the light and walks to the door.
She looks back on her sleeping granddaughter with enormous joy and gratitude.
She smiles to herself as she pulls the door closed behind her, revealing RASPUTIN STANDING BEHIND THE DOOR.
His eyes glow like embers in the dark.
Bartok is perched on his shoulder.
RASPUTIN Yesss ...
RASPUTIN finally "home".
RASPUTIN And what a charming ...
RASPUTIN girlish little home it is.
RASPUTIN Look, Bartok, little angels, the symbol of ...
RASPUTIN love.
RASPUTIN So sweet, so harmless.
Rasputin takes the reliquary from around his waist and places it on the table.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Let's go for a touch of irony, shall we?
He waves his hand and the smoke emerges, emanating toward the walls.
CLOSE ON some CHERUBS as the smoke hits them.
They begin to change, taking on a lean and evil look.
Their tiny arrows grow, becoming lethal, as their eyes turn from soft brown to blood red.
Slowly, they EMERGE from the wallpaper, their small wings growing into horrible pterodactyl membranous paired appendages.
They SWOOP into flight and begin to circle the room, faster and faster.
Rasputin leans precariously over the sleeping Anya, chuckling.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) And there will be no blood on my hands ...
Rasputin backs away as the cherubs aim their JAGGED ARROWS at Anya.
Suddenly, Meetoo leaps up from the bed, barking.
Rasputin, startled, jumps backward.
Bartok falls off his shoulder and on to the table, knocking into the reliquary - which is about to fall.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Nooooooo!
Rasputin catches it.
The SPELL is immediately broken and everything turns back to normal just as Anya wakes up.
She sees Rasputin and lets out a SCREAM.
Rasputin advances on her, his hands outstretched as if to strangle her when he hears footsteps and voices in the hallway.
Rasputin grabs the reliquary and LEAPS out the window, his monk's robe billowing just as the door opens.
Tatiana rushes in and sees Bartok flying out the window.
TATIANA Anastasia!
TATIANA It was just a bat!
TATIANA It's gone, dear...
ANYA No, it wasn't a bat!
ANYA I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
TATIANA No, no child...
TATIANA shush...
TATIANA it's all right ...
She embraces Anya, who is still terrified and knows that she saw what she saw.
Anya sits, looking a bit vacant as two overly French jewelers, PIERRE & ANDRE, fit Anya for her ROYAL CROWN.
Tatiana sits across from Anya and can't help but notice that Anya looks miserable as Sophie bustles about.
SOPHIE A grand ball for the Princess.
SOPHIE How very exciting.
SOPHIE So much to do, so little time...
TATIANA Do it somewhere else, please.
TATIANA Quietly.
The slight is lost on Sophie who bustles out talking to herself.
SOPHIE Caterers ...
SOPHIE invitations ...
SOPHIE saber dancers!
SOPHIE We must have saber dancers!
<u>"RULERS OF RUSSIA" (COMIC REPRISE)
Sophie SINGS as COMIC REPRISE of 'RULERS OF RUSSIA"</u>
Pierre and Andre argue as they fit Anya for the crown.
PIERRE Her head it is ...
PIERRE how you say?
ANDRE Beeg.
ANDRE Zat is how you say it.
ANDRE Beeg.
PIERRE And the crown she is ...
PIERRE how you say?
ANDRE Small!
ANDRE Zat is "how you say" it!
ANDRE Don't be so French, Pierre wit the "how you say" all za time - zat is really annoying.
As they discuss this, Anya wanders away from them, the crown still slightly askew on her head.
Tatiana follows her.
TATIANA You are going to make a beautiful princess.
But Anya simply nods.
Tatiana turns her towards a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, then straightens the crown as they look at their reflections.
TATIANA Lovely...
TATIANA What troubles you, child?
But before Anya can answer, Vladimir leans into the room.
VLADIMIR Madame, your...
VLADIMIR eh...
VLADIMIR guest has arrived.
TATIANA Thank you, Vladimir.,
Tatiana leaves and Vladimir looks at Anya.
Anya, angry at him, turns away.
VLADIMIR Anya...
VLADIMIR Anastasia...
VLADIMIR I'm sorry ...
VLADIMIR We didn't mean to hurt you ...
Anya still won't look at him.
Tatiana walks into her study and is happy to see Dmitri is standing there, looking nervous and very uncomfortable.
TATIANA I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
DMITRI No.
DMITRI Empress, you --
TATIANA I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
He leaps from his chair, exploding with emotion.
DMITRI Empress, no!
DMITRI I will not take the money!
DMITRI I just came to tell you I was sorry...
TATIANA Young man, I...
Dmitri flips his hair out of his eyes and Tatiana gets a look of recognition across her face.
DMITRI ...
DMITRI and I'm going to keep my promise to stay out of your lives, forever.
Tatiana looks at him with great understanding and affection as she realizes,
TATIANA You are the boy ...
DMITRI I should go
TATIANA That last night in the palace...
TATIANA one boy showed us kindness and courage.
TATIANA You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?
TATIANA Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
DMITRI Promise me she'll have her home.
TATIANA She does.
DMITRI And tell me that she's happy.
TATIANA Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
Dmitri comes down the steps, then stops when he sees Anya, wearing her CROWN.
She turns and sees him, stifling her first impulse, then putting on a show of supreme confidence.
DMITRI I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
ANYA I'm glad you did too.
With nothing left to say, he heads for the door.
ANYA Enjoy your fortune.
Dmitri spins, but restrains.
He opens the door and Anya goes back into the Parlor.
They both know that they will never see each other again.
Dmitri busily tosses his few possessions into his backpack as Vladimir - in formal attire - waves an embossed INVITATION at him.
VLADIMIR But this invitation came from the Empress herself!
VLADIMIR It's the social event of the decade!
VLADIMIR You can't turn it down!
DMITRI Watch me.
Vladimir starts to protest.
Dmitri grabs the invitation and tears it up, tossing the pieces into the air.
Vladimir sighs.
VLADIMIR So where will you go?
DMITRI She found her home.
DMITRI Maybe it's time I found one too!
NEW POV from outside the window.
WE DO NOT HEAR THEM, but we see Vlad and Dmitri hug good-bye.
PULL RACK to see it's RASPUTIN'S POV; as he stands on a LADDER OF SMOKE, looking into Dmitri's window.
Rasputin watches Vladimir leave as Dmitri finishes packing.
As the windows BURST OPEN and Rasputin swoops in.
Dmitri backs away, terrified as the ladder dissolves and smoke fills the room.
RASPUTIN So.
RASPUTIN You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
DMITRI Rasputin!
RASPUTIN I know, I know ...
RASPUTIN you thought I was dead.
RASPUTIN That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
Dmitri backs away as the smoke coils around him and Rasputin advances.
DMITRI What do you want?!
RASPUTIN The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
DMITRI You're insane!
DMITRI You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
Dmitri lunges for him but the smoke coils around him like rope, holding him back.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Look at me...
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Look at me!
The SMOKE forms into hands, forcing Dmitri's face toward Rasputin's.
Dmitri's eyes widen.
Rasputin locks on him with his eyes, glowing like red hot coals, as he bears Dmitri in hypnotically.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) You are going to help me kill her...
RASPUTIN (CONT.) You are going to help me kill her...
RASPUTIN (CONT.) her...
ON BARTOK who looks away, obviously not enjoying this.
As WE HEAR Rasputin repeat "You are going to help me" a few more times.
Magnificently, the Eiffel Tower illuminates all of Paris when FLOOD LIGHTS come on and we see a LARGE PARTY has been set underneath it's black iron legs.
WE HEM TRUMPETS as we
MOVE IN CLOSER to see that a stage has been set up on the north side, the "Seine side".
of the Tower, with a large throne-like chair in the center.
Beautiful PARTY GUESTS, many we had seen in the opening Ballroom scene, mingle around excitedly.
Behind the stage, a beautiful curtain separates the party from
INT. BEHIND THE CURTAIN the Princess Anastasia, in crown and full coronation gown.
Anastasia fidgets nervously, looking for the key around her neck, then remembering it isn't there anymore, as a MAJOR RUSSIAN DOMO addresses her and Tatiana.
MAJOR DOMO ...
MAJOR DOMO then as I say "Her Serene Highness Princess Anastasia" you, your Highness, should walk out on to the stage and greet your ...
Tatiana sees that Anastasia isn't listening and dismisses the Major Domo in mid sentence.
TATIANA I believe her highness understands what she has to do.
Major Domo bows and leaves.
Tatiana looks at Anastasia.
TATIANA (CONT.) Don't you, child?
ANYA Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
TATIANA No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
Anya turns to her in confusion.
ANYA There's no choice...
Anya is cut off with a quick knock at the door, as Sophie and Vladimir enter, bowing to them both.
Vladimir has Meetoo, all dressed up in bows and ribbons - and looking miserable - on a leash.
VLADIMIR Your "guest" is unable to attend.
Tatiana is troubled by this news.
Anya starts laughing when she sees Meetoo.
ANYA Oh, Meetoo!
ANYA You look miserable!
ANYA Oh, Vlad - look at him!
VLADIMIR Yes, your highness.
ANYA Poor Meetoo!
VLADIMIR Yes, your highness.
ANYA Cut it out, Vlad!
ANYA I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
TATIANA But they didn't take the money - either one of them.
TATIANA I offered it to them, but they both refused.
Anya is shocked, she takes a minute to process this as
ANYA Dmitri didn't want the money?
TATIANA No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
VLADIMIR Fortunately, I am to be married.
VLADIMIR With your highness, permission.
ANYA Vlad, stop acting this way!
ANYA You're my friend!
VLADIMIR No.
VLADIMIR From now on I am your loyal subject ...
VLADIMIR your highness.
VLADIMIR By your leave?
To Anya's dismay, Vlad and Sophie bow and back out of the room.
ANYA Why does everyone have to act that way?
TATIANA You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
ANYA "If" I accept?!
ANYA Of course I'm going to accept!
ANYA it's what I always wanted!
TATIANA Is it?
TATIANA Is this what you want?
Tatiana gestures to the formality outside.
ANYA I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did.
ANYA I came back to my home with you.
TATIANA You can't go back to find your home.
TATIANA Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
ANYA And this is my future.
ANYA This is who I am!
TATIANA This is who you were.
TATIANA Exactly who you are is up to you.
ANYA I don't know who I am!
ANYA I still don't know!
TATIANA Yes, you do.
TATIANA You do.
Tatiana kisses her on the forehead.
TATIANA (CONT.) And in your heart, you know what is right for you.
Tatiana turns to leave.
ANYA I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
TATIANA And we have found each other nothing will ever change that!
TATIANA I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
Tatiana leaves.
Anya is very torn.
Anya jumps as the TRUMPETS sound announcing her entrance.
The COURTIERS gather, excited, as the Major Domo readies to make his announcement.
Anya, thinking about what Tatiana has said, looks at herself in the mirror.
ANYA'S POV the Princess Anastasia.
But not Anya.
MAJOR DOMO (O.C) Her Serene Highness, the Princess Anastasia!
Pause.
WE HEAR mummers from the crowd outside, various "Where's Anastasia?", then
DMITRI (O.C.) Anya!
Anya spins around, looking for him.
His voice seems distant and ghostly,
DMITRI (O.C.) Anya ...
Anya follows his voice out of the room and into the ELEVATOR.
The doors close.
EXT. ELEVATOR as it rises gently to the very top of the Eiffel Tower not on cables - but on long ropes of smoke.
Rasputin, gleeful, sits perched on a girder, looking down at the party below.
RASPUTIN Look, Bartok.
RASPUTIN Most of them were there the night I made this curse.
RASPUTIN Now, they'll get to see it finished!
RASPUTIN Revenge is a dish best served...
RASPUTIN in front of a larrrrrge audience!
Rasputin leans over the rail and looks down at the party.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Do not despair.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) I'll make sure your beloved princess drops in.
Rasputin chuckles at his own "wit"
BARTOK Ahh, very witty.
BARTOK There's this English guy - Noel Coward - I'll bet he's quaking ...
As the door open and Anya rushes out, looking around.
ANYA Dmitri?
Dmitri is standing - like a zombie - at the far end of the platform.
Anya sees him.
ANYA Dmitri ...
ANYA Grandmama told me.
She stops.
She can tell that something isn't right with Dmitri by the look in his eyes.
ANYA Dmitri, what's wrong?
Dmitri approaches her slowly, zombie-like, arms outstretched.
RASPUTIN Throw her off the edge!
RASPUTIN Do it!
Anya looks up at the booming voice.
ANYA'S POV sees Rasputin.
RASPUTIN from the last night at the palace
ORANGE flash of gunshots
YOUNG DMITRI leading them out the wall panel, then the Face of the YOUNG DMITRI superimposes over the zombie who is coming toward her.
ANYA Dmitri ...
ANYA Look at me!
ANYA It's Anya!
ANYA It's ANYA!
Dmitri stops.
His eyes glazed and frightening.
ANYA You saved my life in the palace!
ANYA You won't take it now...
Anya holds her ground as Dmitri moves toward her, ready to push her off the edge.
ANYA Dmitri.
ANYA I know you would never hurt me.
ANYA You love me.
As Dmitri come close, she moves toward him and kisses him.
He blinks and snaps out of it and is quite happy that Anya is kissing him.
ANYA Dmitri?
DMITRI Anya...
DMITRI where are we?
WE HEAR a howl from above and suddenly Rasputin jumps down.
The reliquary tied to his waist, he's more furious than we've ever seen him - his face literally consumed with rage and hatred.
Anya is terrified - but holds her ground as she did when she was a child.
ANYA I guess you aren't as powerful as you thought!
Rasputin walks slowly toward Anya and Dmitri, burning with rage.
RASPUTIN I'll show you!
DMITRI Run, Anya - go...
ANYA I'm not leaving you!
RASPUTIN Fighting for fair lady.
RASPUTIN How noble...
Dmitri pushes Anya away and charges the much larger Rasputin, who knocks his aside with on swoop of big huge arm.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) And how pathetic.
Rasputin turns to Anya climbing up a girder.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) That's only going to make you fall farther.
Anya turns suddenly and kicks Rasputin in the face, which has the same effect as kicking a brick wall.
Anya is thrown off balance and falls.
Rasputin pushes her with his foot and she slides across the floor to Dmitri.
Anya and Dmitri exchange a quick look as Rasputin, chuckling, advances on them.
Anya reaches up and grabs Rasputin's beard, pulling his face forward so that Dmitri can give him a good roundhouse punch.
The blow does little but enrage Rasputin.
He reaches out and with one huge hand, picks Anya like a rag doll and takes her to the ledge.
DMITRI Anya!
Dmitri throws himself against Rasputin several times only to get batted away like a fly.
Realizing this is futile, Dmitri slips through the FLOOR GIRDERS and scurries towards the edge...
BELOW TEM.
DMITRI POV: Rasputin's large boots above him, heading for the edge.
Rasputin reaches the edge, playful dangling the struggling Anya over the side.
RASPUTIN My curse is now complete!
RASPUTIN Good-bye, babushka!
Anya looks over the ledge.
The city below as she FALLS.
Dmitri emerges from the grid below and GRASS her, holding on to the back of her dress.
DMITRI Take my hand!
DMITRI Hurry!
She manages to spin around, gripping his hand.
ANYA Don't let me go!
DMITRI I'll never let go!
CLOSE their hands, gripping one another.
RASPUTIN (O.C.) What a touching sentiment...
They look up to see his right above them.
Rasputin's boot SMASHES DOWN on Dmitri's hand, which grips the girder.
Dmitri screams out in, but doesn't let go.
He looks down at Anya and pulls her up while Rasputin begins to pry off Dmitri's fingers one at a time.
RASPUTIN This little piggy had a palace...
RASPUTIN this little piggy had a throne...
Anya swings to another beam and now has firm footing as Rasputin continues.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) This little piggy missed the firing squad..
Dmitri is literally holding on with two fingers.
RASPUTIN (CONT.) And this little piggy wanted a home...
RASPUTIN (CONT.) And this little piggy went wee wee wee all the way...
RASPUTIN (CONT.) down!
As Dmitri's last finger is preyed away, he falls but his grasp on Anya's hand is firm and she pulls him onto where she is standing.
Rasputin leans over and bends toward them, three feet from Anya.
The reliquary is dangling.
Anya reaches up to grab on to it but her aim is off and she HITS it.
The reliquary flies and SMASHES against the side of the tower, shattering.
Rasputin realizes what has happened and scrambles away in terror.
ON BARTOK who covers his eyes.
ON ANYA AND DMITRI who climb back up to the platform.
LONG SHOT of the Eiffel Tower as the EVIL SPIRITS FROM THE RELIQUARY burst out.
The SPIRITS take on all the forms we've seen earlier: BEARS, MINIONS, SNAKES, and combinations of all.
They grow and swirl, with hideous MOANING noises.
Anya and Dmitri huddle together, in disbelief.
ON RASPUTIN as the SPIRITS begin to swarm around him, a TORNADO of horrid beings.
Re screams as they pull him off the ground.
ON ANYA AND DMITRI as the force of the tornado increases, they have to hold on to the girders and each other in order not to be sucked in.
Bartok is thrown against the side of the tower and slithers to the floor.
ON RASPUTIN suspended over the Eiffel Tower in the maelstrom.
He Screams wildly as the spirits encircle his, torment him and EXPLODE - pieces fly and disintegrate in mid-air, in wild colors and smoke.
ON DMITRI AND ANYA who hug each other in relief.
They stand, looking out.
The smoke dissipates, showing them the city lights below.
ON BARTOK who rises, patting his chest- He's about to let out a Bartokism...
but all the emerges are LITTLE BAT SQUEAKS.
He's surprised as first, then thrilled.
The spell is broken and he's just a bat again.
DMITRI AND ANYA as he reaches down and picks up the crown that fell off her head in the fight.
He hands it to her.
DMITRI Come on...
DMITRI I'll take you home.
Anya looks lovingly at Dmitri and doesn't put the crown back on.
ANYA I am home.
(The Love Duet For Anya And Dmitri).
A SIMPLE EMOTIONAL BALLAD for two people who realize at last that their hearts have led then to each other, to "home".
This will work within the dramatic context of the film (sung by the characters) but can also be re-recorded as a Pop single.</U>
The song continues over various scenes:
Tatiana smiling, knowingly.
SOPHIE & VLADIMIR sneaking a kiss in the middle of the party.
Xenia and Estelle look at each other with their stone faces..
and smile.
Hanging from the rafters of the Eiffel Tower, no sure what to do next - then a cute female bat flies up next to his and "bats" her eyes.
ANYA & DMITRI walking over the River bridge with Meetoo following behind them...
a family - going home together.
