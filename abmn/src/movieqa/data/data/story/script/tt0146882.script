HIGH FIDELITY

D.V. De Vincentis, Steve Pink, & John Cusack
Based on the novel by Nick Hornby

London Draft Registered: WGAw
Not a minisystem, not a matching set, but coveted audiophile clutter of McIntosh and Nakamichi, each component from a different era, bought piece by piece in various nanoseconds of being flush.
ROB (V.O.) What came first?
ROB (V.O.) The music or the misery?
ROB (V.O.) People worry about kids playing with guns and watching violent videos, we're scared that some sort of culture of violence is taking them over...
Big thin LPs.
Fields of them.
We move across them, slowly...
they seem to come to rest in an end of a few books...
but then the CD's start, and go on, faster and faster, forever then the singles, then the tapes...
ROB (V.O.) But nobody worries about kids listening to thousands -- literally thousands -- of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss.
It seems the records, tapes, and CD's will never end until...
we come to ROB -- always a hair out of place, a face that grows on you.
He sits in an oversized beanbag chair and addresses us, the wall of music behind him.
ROB Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable, or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?
Group of bags huddled next to the door.
Not the go-on-
vacation set, but the clothes-to-coffee-maker moving out variety.
Rob stares at them, his face unreadable, his head gripped by a big pair Boudokan headphones.
We hear what he is hearing, something foreboding and upbeat at the same time.
LAURA, Rob's girlfriend, enters the room, and he immediately pulls the headphones off.
She clocks him for a moment, catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment of nonpresence.
She begins to heft the bags, Rob goes to her, a little tardy for his big goodbye.
Laura begins to cry a bit.
LAURA I don't really know what I'm doing.
He smiles, and she doesn't.
He adjusts.
ROB You don't have to go this second.
ROB You can stay until whenever.
LAURA We've done the hard part now.
LAURA I might as well, you know...
ROB Well stay for tonight, then.
Laura shakes her head, lifts the last small bag, and backs out the door.
A strap catches on a handle and the two of them wrestle with it a bit, while trying to keep the door open, until Laura awkwardly disappears from view and the door shuts behind Rob.
He stays right there staring at the shut door for a long moment, listening to the fading sound of Laura and her dragging bags.
Rob's left hand cranks the volume knob while his right switches the CD changer to something loud and adrenal.
He addresses us again.
ROB My desert-island, all-time, top five most memorable break-ups, in
chronological order are as follows: Alison Ashworth, Penny Hardwick, Jackie Allen, Charlie Nicholson, Sarah Kendrew.
Laura drags her bags, banging down the stairs --
Rob moves around the apartment, seeming to expand physically, looking for change as he continues.
ROB Those were the ones that really hurt.
ROB Can you see your name in that list, Laura?
ROB Maybe you'd sneak into the top ten, but there's no place for you in the top five.
ROB Sorry.
ROB Those places are reserved for the kind of humiliations and heartbreaks that you're just not capable of delivering.
He adjusts the angle of the TV, stuffs a creepy family portrait into a drawer.
ROB That probably sounds crueler than it's meant to, but the fact is, we're too old to take each other miserable.
ROB Unhappiness used to mean something.
ROB Now it's just a drag like a cold or having no money.
He moves through the living room to an open window facing the street.
Looking down two stories, he sees Laura emerge from the building and drag her bags toward her car across the street.
ROB If you really wanted to mess me up, you should have got to me earlier.
Rob and Alison sit on the bench, kissing awkwardly.
ROB (V.O.) Which brings us to number one.
ROB (V.O.) Alison Ashworth.
The same shot, the next night: new clothes, same clumsy make- out session.
ROB (V.O.) My relationship with Alison Ashworth lasted six hours.
...Next night...
ROB (V.O.) The two hours after school and before The Rockford Files, three days in a row.
ROB (V.O.) On the fourth afternoon.
...And the fourth night...
ROB (V.O.) Kevin Bannister.
Alison and another boy, KEVIN BANNISTER.
Kissing.
In the background, Rob approaches and stops.
He implodes with self- consciousness and humiliation and attempts to affect a casual gait as he mopes away.
ROB (V.O.) It would be nice to think that since I was fourteen, times have changed, relationships have become more sophisticated, females less cruel, skins thicker, but there still seems to be an element of that afternoon in everything that has happened to me since.
ROB (V.O.) All my other romantic stories seem to be a scrambled version of that first one.
Rob sits in his chair, a cord leading from the stereo to headphones draped around his neck.
Behind him is the wall of music.
ROB Number two.
ROB Penny Hardwick.
ROB Penny was great-looking, and her top five recording artists were Carly Simon, Carole King, James Taylor, Cat Stevens, and Elton John...
He lets the needle down on the turntable next to him.
"Nobody Does It Better" by Carly Simon begins to play as
...and continues as SOUNDTRACK.
PENNY, 16, is walking across the grass toward us.
She's the clean, sporty, nice wholesome girl-next-door.
She waves to off-camera friends, smiling a winning smile.
ROB (V.O.) Everybody liked her.
ROB (V.O.) She was nice.
ROB (V.O.) Nice manners.
ROB (V.O.) Nice grades.
ROB (V.O.) Nice- looking.
Penny and Rob sit on the edge of the bed, kissing.
Rob moves his hand up toward the breast, but the hand then seems to have a new idea, and dives south to follow the thigh into Penny's skirt...
ROB (V.O.) She was so nice, in fact, that she wouldn't let me put my hand underneath, or even on top of, her bra.
...when he contacts skin, Penny rolls like a gymnast away and off of the bed, out of frame.
Rob looks away balefully.
"Nobody Does It Better" continues as Rob walks Penny to her front door.
She is smiling, he seems distant.
ROB (V.O.) Penny was nice, but I wasn't interested in nice, just breasts, and therefore she was no good to me.
ROB (V.O.) And so I was finished with her.
She leans in to kiss him, and he shrugs her off.
ROB What's the point?
ROB It never goes anywhere.
Without looking at her, Rob turns and walks down the street, getting smaller.
Penny watches for a while.
Rob sways with the other commuters.
ROB She cried, and I hated her for it, because she made me feel bad.
ROB I started dating a girl who everybody said would put out, and Penny went with this asshole Chris Thompson who told me that he had sex with her after something like three dates.
ROB How had Penny gone from a girl who wouldn't do anything to a girl who would do everything?
A BUSINESSMAN looks up from his paper at Rob, then back down.
An old Chicago block of local merchants, on a busy street.
Rob makes his way down the street, jangling a set of keys and talking to us.
ROB My store's right up here.
ROB It's called The Record Exchange.
ROB It's carefully placed to attract the bare minimum of window shoppers.
Rob arrives at a storefront, and begins unlocking a rusty gate with two locks and then a beaten-down door.
ROB I get by because of the people who make a special effort to shop here on Saturday young men, always young men, who spend a disproportionate amount of their time looking for deleted Smiths singles and "original not rereleased" underline Frank Zappa albums.
In almost darkness.
More light might penetrate the windows if there weren't so many record-release posters taped to them.
A dusty narrow corridor clad in burlap and shag rug.
On the walls are bagged 45's you will never hear unless you commit your life to the losing proposition of listening to every noodling of Jah Wobble and Glen Glenn and other people you've never heard of.
But as Rob opens the door, enters, and flips a switch causing the fluorescents to sputter, we see in his eyes the reverence and earnestness of a football coach gazing across an empty field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty church.
ROB The fetish properties are not unlike porn.
ROB I would feel guilty taking their money if I wasn't, kind of, well, one of them.
As he walks one of the two slim aisles toward the back, he stops on a dime, steps back and pulls a CD from the sea and
replaces it almost the same position, but not quite -- meticulousness and pride in this gesture...
After a moment the door creaks open behind Rob, admitting DICK, a nervous, forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile with long greasy black hair, a Sonic Youth T-shirt, a monstrous pair of headphones, and a canvas record bag emblazoned with a label logo.
ROB 'Morning, Dick.
DICK Oh, hi.
DICK Hi, Rob.
ROB Good weekend?
DICK Yeah, OK.
DICK I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.
DICK The one on Testament of Youth.
DICK Never released here.
DICK Japanese import only.
ROB Great.
DICK I'll tape it for you.
ROB No, that's okay.
ROB Really.
DICK 'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls.
DICK etc.
DICK The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.
DICK You didn't see the cover though.
ROB Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
DICK Well, I'll just make it for you.
ROB Okay.
Dick is behind the counter, Rob in the aisles with a clipboard doing inventory.
ROB What's this?
DICK The new Belle and Sebastian.
DICK Like it?
The door flies open and BARRY, an acid-tongued post-punk rock misanthrope without quite enough intelligence to conceptualize his own rebellion, walks in.
His teeth are clenched in air-guitar concentration and he's phonetically cranking a Clash riff:
Dick shrinks back from him instinctively.
He stops mid-step and cocks his ear at the music playing in the store.
His face adopts an exaggerated grimace.
BARRY Holy Shiite!
BARRY What the fuck's this?
DICK It's the new --
ROB It's the record we've been listening to and enjoying, Barry.
Barry moves in on the stereo behind the counter, and Dick gets out of his way.
BARRY Well that's problematic because it sucks ass.
He pops the CD out and frisbees it to Dick.
BARRY Yours, I assume...
Barry pulls a tape out of his jacket and jams it in.
"How to Kill a Radio Consultant" by Public Enemy comes through at through the red levels.
Barry walks in rhythm toward the stockroom and disappears.
Rob goes behind the counter and stops the tape.
Barry's head pops out of the stockroom.
BARRY What are you doing?
ROB I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
BARRY Public Enemy!
BARRY All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.
BARRY Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
ROB I don't want old sad bastard music either.
ROB I just want something I can ignore.
BARRY But it's my new tape.
BARRY My Monday morning tape.
BARRY I made it last night just for today.
ROB Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.
ROB You should get out of bed earlier.
BARRY Don't you want to hear what's next?
ROB What's next?
BARRY Play it.
ROB Say it.
BARRY "Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Rob groans.
DICK Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
BARRY No.
BARRY The Righteous Brothers.
DICK Oh well.
DICK Nevermind.
Barry bristles and moves slowly in on Dick.
BARRY What?
DICK Nothing.
BARRY No, not nothing.
BARRY What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
DICK Nothing.
DICK I just prefer the other one.
BARRY Bullshit.
ROB How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
BARRY Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
ROB Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
BARRY Great.
BARRY That's the fun of working in a record store.
BARRY Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.
BARRY I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator.
BARRY I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
ROB We'll do it next Monday.
BARRY Well what's the point in that?
From outside.
HEAR THE SOUND OF SKATEBOARD WHEELS CLACKING AND SCRAPING, GETTING LOUDER.
Rob, Dick and Barry stop fighting to listen, then each moves purposefully to a spot in the store.
Dick to the register, Barry to the back, Rob next to the door, as if bracing for a street fight.
The SOUND gets closer, then stops.
The door swings open to admit VINCE and JUSTIN, two fifteen-year-old skate punks.
Vince's hair is post-apocolyptically hacked to different lengths, Justin's in uniformly shaven with leopard spots dyed browse.
Rob follows them, watching their every move.
Dick counters from his perch, getting another angle.
Barry cracks his knuckles threateningly.
Vince and Justin do their best browser impersonations.
Finally Justin plucks a CD, and the two move to the counter.
ROB Hey.
ROB Didn't you steal that one already?
DICK Can I help you?
JUSTIN Just this.
DICK That'll be fifteen-twenty-seven.
Vince reaches into his deep pocket and pulls out a paper cup, with piece of paper attached that says "Please help me.
I'm retarded."
He pours a mass of change and crumpled singles onto the counter.
Dick begins counting it out.
VINCE Isn't your name Dick?
DICK Yes.
VINCE That sucks.
VINCE Get it?
Dick cracks a sad smile for a second.
He bags the CD and Vince and Justin are off.
Rob walks back through the stock room door.
Rob is on his knees, opening boxes with a razor knife.
He talks to us as he works.
ROB I'm sick of the sight of this place, to be honest.
ROB Some days I'm afraid --
Dick sticks his head in the door, looks at Rob, looks where Rob is looking (camera), and retreats back through the door.
Rob continues.
ROB I'm afraid I'll go berserk, rip the Elvis Costello mobile from the ceiling, throw the "Country Artists Male A-K" rack out onto the streets, go off to work in a Virgin Megastore and never come back --
He hears the bell on the front door RING, and he stops and listens, looks a bit worried.
CUSTOMER I'm looking for a record for my daughter.
CUSTOMER For her birthday.
CUSTOMER "I Just Called To Say I Love You."
CUSTOMER Do you have it?
BARRY Oh yeah.
BARRY We got it.
Rob relaxes and goes back to work.
CUSTOMER Great.
CUSTOMER Can I have it then?
BARRY No, you can't.
Rob deflates, shaking his head.
Barry leans back, elbows up on the counter behind him, talking to the CUSTOMER, a middle-aged graying man in a raincoat.
CUSTOMER Why not?
BARRY Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.
BARRY Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
CUSTOMER What's your problem?
CUSTOMER What did I...
CUSTOMER Why are you --
BARRY Do you even know your daughter?
BARRY There is no way she likes that song.
BARRY Or is she in a coma?
The Customer throws up his hands and starts out of the store.
CUSTOMER Okay, okay, buddy.
CUSTOMER I didn't know it was Pick On the Middle-Aged Square Guy Day.
CUSTOMER My apologies.
CUSTOMER I'll be on my way.
He steps out of the door.
BARRY B'Bye!
Outside, anger catches up to the Customer.
He turns and throws up a middle finger --
-- and bolts.
Barry smiles and turns to see
ROB
standing in the doorway of the stock room.
He feigns applause.
ROB Nice, Barry.
BARRY Rob.
BARRY Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.
BARRY Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?
BARRY "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
ROB You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
BARRY We didn't even really have it.
BARRY I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk."
BARRY I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
ROB Not the point.
BARRY Oh, so what's the point then?
ROB I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
BARRY "Our customers?" You think that Mr.
BARRY L.L.
BARRY Bean out there is going to be a regular?
Rob's face begins to redden with anger.
ROB Barry, I'm fucking broke!
ROB I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
BARRY Bullshit.
BARRY The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.
BARRY Why not have a little fun?
BARRY Big fucking deal.
ROB What did he ever do to you?
BARRY He offended me with his terrible taste.
ROB It wasn't even his terrible taste.
ROB It was his daughter's.
BARRY Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?
BARRY You're going soft in your old age, Rob.
BARRY There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.
BARRY Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.
BARRY You're right, Rob.
BARRY I am so sorry.
BARRY How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
Rob is red and seething.
BARRY And by the way, I tell you this for your own good: That's the worst sweater I've ever seen.
BARRY I have never seen a sweater that bad worn by anyone I'm on speaking terms with.
BARRY It's a disgrace to the human race.
Rob springs on Barry, grabbing him by the lapels and jerking him up against the wall.
Rob is so mad he can't say anything.
DICK Hey, guys...
DICK Hey.
Rob runs out of steam and drops Barry, who backpedals fast.
BARRY What are you, some kind of fucking maniac?
BARRY If this jacket's torn you're gonna pay big.
Barry stomps out of the store.
Rob turns and goes back to the stockroom, and sits on the stepladder.
Dick appears in the doorway, terrified.
DICK Are you all right?
ROB Yeah.
ROB I'm sorry...
ROB Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.
ROB She's gone.
ROB And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
DICK 'Course I will, Rob.
DICK No problem.
DICK No problem at all.
DICK I'll tell him next time I see him.
Rob nods.
Dick sets out into the uncharted conversational territory of interpersonal relationships.
DICK I've ah...
DICK got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem.
DICK I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
ROB Fine.
DICK I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.
DICK Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle (flashes CD of pretty woman) playing at Lounge Ax tonight.
DICK I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish...
DICK but, you know, good.
DICK So I'll tell him before that.
DICK Good news and bad news kind of thing.
Dick laughs nervously.
DICK Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.
DICK I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.
DICK And he likes you.
DICK It's just that --
ROB I understand, Dick.
DICK Sure.
DICK 'Course.
DICK Rob, look.
DICK Do you want to...
DICK talk about it, that kind of thing?
Rob looks up at Dick, who is so nervous that his brow is wet.
ROB No.
ROB Thanks though, Dick.
Dick sighs with relief, and smiles his way out of the stock room.
Rob to camera.
ROB Number three in the top five break- ups was Charlie Nicholson, sophomore year of college.
ROB Some people never got over 'Nam, or the night their band opened for Nirvana.
ROB I guess I never really got over Charlie.
About twenty feet away we see a tall, thin beauty, bleach- blonde hair cropped short in darling '80's new-wave asymmetry.
She is speaking animatedly to a PAMPHLETEER, driving her points home with a forefinger.
ROB (V.O.) She looked different.
ROB (V.O.) Dramatic.
ROB (V.O.) Exotic.
ROB (V.O.) She talked a lot, about remarkably interesting things like music, books, film, and politics...
A younger Rob sits amongst a group of STUDENTS who are engaged in a heated conversation.
He is smiling, mouth closed, just happy to be there.
Charlie sitting next to him, tousles his hair as she talks incessantly.
ROB (V.O.) ...so we didn't have those terrible, strained sentences, that seemed to characterized most of my relationships.
ROB (V.O.) And she liked me.
ROB (V.O.) She liked me.
ROB (V.O.) She liked me.
Charlie gives Rob a quick kiss and keeps talking...
Rob and Charlie walk arm in arm, Rob in cool clothes and sunglasses trying to look cool, Charlie making a point about something.
Rob checks out how cool he looks with her as they walk by a store window REFLECTION.
ROB (V.O.) We went out for two years, and for every single minute I felt as though I was standing on a dangerously narrow ledge.
ROB (V.O.) I couldn't get comfortable, couldn't ever stretch out and relax.
ROB (V.O.) Why would a girl -- no, a woman -- like Charlie go out with someone who only a few years ago sewed a Foghat patch on his jacket?
ROB (V.O.) I felt like all those people who suddenly shaved their heads and said they'd always been punks.
ROB (V.O.) I felt like a fraud.
ROB (V.O.) And I was depressed by the lack of flamboyance in my wardrobe...
The fabulous sophomore design student's studio apartment:
White wood floor, white walls, overvarnished door, Doisneaux print on the wall, futon on the floor.
Rob lies back on his elbows, watching Charlie in uncomfortable, worried awe.
She stands, her back to him, wearing only her underwear and pulling on a T-shirt -- a heartbreaking image to look back on.
ROB (V.O.) ...I worried about my abilities as a lover.
ROB (V.O.) I was intimidated by the other men in her design department, and became convinced that she was going to leave me for one of them.
Charlie turns around and looks at Rob with naked ambivalence.
ROB (V.O.) She left me for one of them.
ROB (V.O.) The dreaded Marco.
It is RAINING like crazy, and Rob is shouting up at a lit window, maniacally gesturing.
The curtains part and Charlie's figure appears, clad only in a sheet.
Next to her is a tall, built, handsome man, MARCO, also in a sheet.
Eventually he falls to his knees with a splash and buries his head in his hands.
The light goes out.
ROB (V.O.) And I lost it.
ROB (V.O.) I lost it all.
ROB (V.O.) Dignity, faith, fifteen pounds...
Rob wandering through the rain.
ROB (V.O.) Any small idea of personal identity that I had acquired up to that point.
A younger and catatonic Rob listlessly sorts through a stack of records.
ROB (V.O.) I came to three months later, and to my surprise had flunked out of school and started working in a record store.
Rob stands in front of his wall of music, shifting LPs around between the shelves and piles on the floor as he talks to us.
ROB What I really learned from the Charlie Debacle is that you gotta punch your
weight.
Charlie was out of my Class: too pretty, too smart, too witty, too much.
What am I?
Average.
A middleweight.
Not the smartest guy in the world, but certainly not the dumbest.
I've read books like The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time of Cholera, and understood them, I think -- they're about girls, right?
-- just kidding -- but I don't like them very much.
My all time top five favorite books are Johnny Cash's autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil Stevenson, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't know, probably something by Kurt Vonnegut.
I look through the New Yorker when my neighbor's done with it, and I'm not averse to going down to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles films, although on the whole I prefer American films.
Top five being Blade Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first two Godfathers which we'll count as one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining.
I'm okay looking, average height, not skinny, not fat.
My genius, if I can call it that, is to combine a whole load of averageness into one compact frame.
You might say there were millions like me, but there aren't, really: Alot of guys have impeccable music taste but don't read, alot of guys read but are really fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to women but have stupid beards, alot of guys have a Woody Allen sense of humor but look like Woody Allen.
Some drink too much, some drive like assholes, some get into fights, or show off money, or do drugs.
I don't do any of these things, really.
If I do okay with women it's not because of the virtues I have, but because of the ugly flaws I don't have...
So.
Charlie and I didn't match.
After her I was determined to never get out of my league again.
Rob presses play on the answering machine.
A pleasant, older female voice is heard.
It's JANET, Laura's mother.
JANET Hello, you two.
JANET Laura, it's your mother.
JANET Your father's angina is a little rough today and I thought he'd like to talk to you.
JANET No big deal.
JANET I love you two.
JANET Bye.
Beep.
LIZ Rob, it's Liz.
LIZ Just calling to see, well, if you're okay.
LIZ Give me a ring.
LIZ I'm not taking sides.
LIZ Yet.
LIZ Lot's of love.
LIZ Bye.
He pulls an LP from a shelf, puts it on the turntable and sits back in his chair.
The MUSIC becomes SOUNDTRACK to the following scenes.
Rob and SARAH, a thin, modestly attractive young woman, SARAH, walk and talk.
They seem to be emphatically complaining together.
ROB (V.O.) Charlie and I didn't match.
ROB (V.O.) Marco and Charlie matched.
ROB (V.O.) Me and Sarah, number four on the all time break- ups list, matched.
ROB (V.O.) She wore more or less the same clothes as mine, had an acceptable working knowledge of music, and she had been dumped by some asshole named Michael.
ROB (V.O.) He was her moment, Charlie was mine.
ROB (V.O.) Sarah had sworn off men.
ROB (V.O.) I had sworn off women.
ROB (V.O.) It made sense to pool our loathing of the opposite sex, swear them off together, and get to share a bed with someone at the same time.
Rob and SARAH sit up in bed, staring at the television...
ROB (V.O.) We were frightened of being left alone for the rest of our lives.
ROB (V.O.) Only people of a certain disposition are frightened of being alone for the rest of their lives at twenty- six.
ROB (V.O.) We were of that disposition.
ROB (V.O.) Everything seemed much later than it was.
INT. SARAH'S KITCHEN - MOS - DAY ROB'S POV of Sarah, sitting across the table, mid-confession.
ROB (V.O.) When she told me that she met someone else it made no sense.
ROB (V.O.) Her meeting someone else was contrary to the whole spirit of our arrangement.
ROB (V.O.) All we really had in common was that we were dumped by people, and that we were against dumping.
ROB (V.O.) We were violently anti-dump.
ROB (V.O.) So how come I got dumped?
The MUSIC becomes PRESENCE again, and Rob takes the needle off the record.
ROB You run the risk of losing anyone who is worth spending time with.
ROB But I didn't know that at the time.
ROB All I saw was that I'd moved down a division and that it still hadn't worked out, and this seemed cause for a great deal of misery and self- pity.
ROB And that's when Laura came along.
Rob is surrounded by stacks of records on the floor.
He looks to camera.
ROB I'm reorganizing my records tonight.
ROB It's something I do in times of emotional distress.
ROB When Laura was here I had them in alphabetical order, before that, chronologically.
ROB Tonight, though, I'm trying to put them in the order in which I bought them.
ROB That way I can write my own autobiography without picking up a pen.
ROB Pull them all off the shelves, look for Revolver and go from there.
ROB I'll be able to see how I got from Deep Purple to The Soft Boys in twenty- five moves.
ROB What I really like about my new system is that it makes me more complicated than I am.
ROB To find anything you have to be me, or at the very least a doctor in Rob-ology.
ROB If you wanna find Landslide by Fleetwood Mac you have to know that I bought it for someone in the fall of 1983 and then didn't give it to them for personal reasons.
ROB But you don't know any of that, do you?
ROB You would have to ask me to--
The phone rings again.
Rob picks it up.
ROB Yeah?
MOM Hi, Rob.
MOM It's your mother.
Rob deflates a bit.
ROB Hi, Mom.
MOM Everything all right?
ROB Great.
ROB Super-fantastic.
MOM How's the store?
ROB So so.
ROB Up and down.
MOM Your lucky Laura's doing so well.
MOM If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
Rob holds his lips together with thumb and forefinger, but succumbs --
ROB She left.
ROB She's gone.
MOM What do you mean?
MOM Where did she go?
ROB How would I know?
ROB Gone.
ROB Girlfriend.
ROB Leave.
ROB Not say where gone.
ROB Laura move out.
MOM Well call her mother.
ROB She just called.
ROB She doesn't even know.
ROB It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.
ROB That's weird, isn't it?
ROB You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and...
ROB I dunno...
Silence.
ROB There'll be another mom and another Christmas.
ROB Right?
Silence...
More silence.
ROB Hello?
ROB Anybody there?
ROB I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
MOM You know that's not what's upsetting me.
ROB Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
MOM I knew this would happen.
MOM What are you going to do Rob?
ROB I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.
ROB Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
MOM And after that?
ROB Meet a nice girl and have children.
ROB I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
MOM I knew this was going to happen.
ROB Then what are you getting so upset about?
MOM What did Laura say?
MOM Do you know why she left?
ROB It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
MOM So you say.
MOM I'd like to hear her side of it.
ROB Mom!
ROB For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!
ROB She is not that kind of girl!
ROB To use a phrase.
ROB That's not what happens now.
MOM Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.
MOM You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
Silence.
Rob busted.
ROB Shut up, Mom.
Rob hangs up the phone.
He fills up his glass again, takes a swig, and slumps into a chair.
If there was any wind left in Rob, it just got knocked out.
After a moment, he gets to his feet, grabs his jacket and heads out the door.
Rob comes down the street and gets in the short line to enter the club.
From inside he hears a GUITAR, playing a tune that becomes familiar not only to Rob, but to us.
When a strong, lilting female VOICE begins to sing, we hear what it is: "Baby I Love Your Way," by Peter Frampton.
Rob smiles at first, but begins to darken as the verse continues.
He steps out of line and leans against the outside wall, listening.
Is he beginning to cry?
Yes, he is...
ROB Peter.
ROB Frampton.
ROB That perm!
ROB "Show Me the Way"!
ROB A phenomenon based on a live album that was actually recorded in a studio!
ROB What is happening?
ROB I am getting misty, choked up at a song that I had the good sense at twelve to realize was so saccharine and stupid as to be inarticulatable, until Michael Bolton, that is.
He looks around self-consciously, and paces a bit, deciding whether or not to stay.
He takes a deep breath, and heads in the door.
As Rob enters he looks to the stage, where MARIE LASALLE is standing alone with her acoustic guitar, heading toward the song's finish.
Rob's expression begins to shift from the melancholy to something else altogether.
Marie is beautiful, and Marie has touched his heart.
Rob navigates toward her though the small crowd as if pulled by something unseen.
He addresses us over his shoulder.
ROB Sentimental music makes you nostalgic and hopeful at the same time.
ROB Marie's the hopeful part.
ROB Laura's the nostalgia part.
ROB These things happen.
ROB They happen to men, at any rate.
ROB This is why I shouldn't be listening to pop music.
As he gets closer to the stage --
Rob looks over to see Dick sitting with Barry, a few feet away.
He shakes it off and sits with them, extending a meaningful hand to Barry, who takes it.
They turn back to the stage as Marie finishes the song.
ROB I always hated this song.
DICK Yeah.
BARRY Yeah.
ROB But now I kind of like it.
Dick and Barry nod, then keep watching.
All three of them are in their own private fantasies with Marie.
DICK She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
BARRY Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
DICK That's what I said.
BARRY No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
DICK It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."
DICK But I could be wrong.
BARRY You can be and are wrong.
They drop it, so that their eyes can drift back to Marie.
BARRY I wanna date a musician...
ROB I wanna live with a musician.
ROB She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
BARRY ...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
DICK Just in the background somewhere.
MARIE as the song ends, and she smiles out over the room.
The audience applauds.
MARIE Thanks, you guys, I know I'm not supposed to like that song, but I do.
MARIE I'm gonna take a break for a second.
MARIE Anybody wants to buy one of my tapes, they're five bucks up here.
MARIE One of my other personalities will be selling them.
BARRY Let's go get one.
ROB Let's not.
DICK I want a tape.
Barry and Dick stand and begin to move off...
ROB I don't need to go up there right now.
...and they're gone.
After a beat, Rob gets up and follows them.
Dick and Barry wait nervously to buy a tape, Rob just behind them.
Marie processes sales with polite monosyllables, until the three get up front.
MARIE Enjoying yourselves?
They dart eyes to each other, then nod.
MARIE Good.
MARIE 'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
ROB Good.
Rob hands her a ten and she roots around in a duffel bag for change...
ROB So you live in Chicago now?
MARIE Yup.
MARIE Not far from here, actually.
BARRY You like it?
MARIE It's okay.
MARIE Hey.
MARIE You guys might be the sort to know.
MARIE Are there any good record stores around here or do I have to go downtown?
Barry and Dick do not try to control themselves.
They point to Rob.
DICK He's got one!
BARRY On Clark Street!
DICK A couple blocks!
DICK About six!
BARRY We work there!
DICK You'd love it!
Marie laughs.
MARIE What do you sell?
BARRY A little of anything that matters.
BARRY Rock, soul, R&B, punk rock, hip- hop, ska, new wave...
MARIE Sounds great.
The line behind them is moving in, and Marie smiles at them and turns to someone else.
They scurry back toward their table.
ROB What did you tell her about the shop for?
BARRY I didn't know it was classified information.
BARRY I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
Rob looks over Barry at Marie.
She catches his eye as she looks over the room.
His eyes shoot to the floor.
Rob is going through a huge stack of used CD's, sorting them off into different bins, bouncing his head absently to the music -- the same song of Marie's that Rob had on when Laura called last night.
Rob reaches over and hits the SPEAKER button on the phone, still in the groove of sorting.
ROB Rob here.
LIZ Hey.
LIZ It's Liz.
ROB What's happenin'.
LIZ You called this morning?
ROB Yeah.
ROB I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.
ROB It made me feel like...
ROB like less of an asshole.
LIZ How're you holding up?
ROB Actually, I'm fine.
ROB I'm great.
ROB Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?
ROB Maybe it is time to move on.
ROB Maybe we're just not right for each other.
ROB Or maybe we are.
ROB But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be."
ROB You know?
LIZ Yeah.
LIZ Like I said, I don't want to take sides.
LIZ And I like Laura with you.
LIZ She's more fun, more open.
LIZ You guys are good together.
LIZ I just wish you two could, I don't know.
LIZ I don't think much of this Ian guy --
-- Dick bursts in, huge-faced --
DICK Rob.
ROB Liz, hold on a second --
ROB What?
DICK Marie LaSalle is in the store!
DICK Here, she's here, and now!
Rob freezes, he and Dick turn to the speaker, which cranks Marie's voice.
Rob goes to the phone and picks up the handset.
ROB Liz, can you hold for a second?
He hits hold.
ROB I'll be out there!
ROB Go!
ROB Hey, Liz, I gotta go...
ROB Tomorrow night?
ROB Great.
ROB Green Mill.
ROB Fine.
ROB Seven?
ROB Done.
ROB Thanks.
ROB Right.
ROB Bye.
He hangs up fast, spins around to look in a cracked one-foot- square cracked mirror bearing the logo of Aerosmith that is mounted on the wall, and moves out into the
FRONT ROOM and up the aisle fast toward the stereo where he turns Marie's music off.
He takes a deep breath and looks up, meeting her eyes.
ROB Oh.
ROB Hi.
Marie smiles.
MARIE Don't you like that?
ROB No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it...
ROB Well.
He reaches back and puts it back on.
He cracks his face into a smile, then walks fast back to the stock room door.
Marie watches him go.
STOCK ROOM where as soon as he crosses the threshold his fist clench and he grimaces:
Dick comes in --
DICK Rob --!
Dick backs out fast.
Rob leans on a wall.
Barry enters --
BARRY We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!
BARRY All three of us.
ROB That's fucking great, Barry.
ROB We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.
ROB Fantastic, Barry!
BARRY We can take your car.
ROB It's not my car, now is it?
ROB It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it.
ROB So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab.
ROB Wow.
ROB Fucking great.
Barry sighs, throws up his hands and heads out the door.
BARRY Jaggoff...
Barry exits.
Rob seems to be having trouble staying on his feet.
ROB Who the fuck is Ian?!
Rob enters and walks to the mail table, looking like shit.
He starts sifting through envelopes for his.
ROB Laura doesn't know anybody called Ian.
ROB There's no Ian at her office.
ROB She has no friends named Ian.
ROB She has never met anyone called Ian in her whole life.
ROB Although there may have been one in college -- but I am almost certain that since 1989 she has lived in an Ian-less universe.
He slows...
and stops.
His face gets a little paler as he lifts a letter up to his face.
A cable service bill to a Mr. I. Raymond.
ROB
as he looks at it, divining.
ROB "I.
ROB Raymond."
ROB Ray.
ROB "I."
ROB IAN.
Rob to camera.
ROB Mr. I Raymond.
ROB "Ray" to his friends, and, more importantly, to his neighbors.
ROB The guy who up until about six weeks ago lived upstairs.
ROB I knew it was him the moment I saw the letter.
ROB I start to remember things now: His stupid clothing, his music -- Latin, Bulgarian, whatever fucking world music was trendy that week--stupid laugh, awful cooking smells.
ROB I can't remember anything good about him at all.
ROB I never liked him much then, and I fucking hate him now...
ROB I manage to block out the worst, most painful, most disturbing memory of him until I go to bed.
Darkness.
We move silently through the rooms, and enter the bedroom...
closer to the bed, we see Rob on his back, sheets held clenched up to his chin.
He stares at the ceiling, sadly.
To almost the same shot, but it's Rob and Laura in the bed, semi-tangled.
Laura has a book in her lap.
A CREAKING is heard.
Laura's eyes go to the ceiling, and Rob sits up at attention.
They look up at the light fixture, which shakes a little faster, with the rhythm of the creaking.
Someone is definitely having sex upstairs, and they are going for it.
ROB Jeez.
ROB He goes on long enough.
LAURA I should be so lucky.
They turn to each other and laugh.
JUMP CUT BACK to Rob lying still in bed, staring at the ceiling.
ROB You are as abandoned and as noisy as any character in a porn film, Laura.
ROB You are Ian's plaything, responding to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic delight.
ROB No woman in the history of the world is having better sex than the sex you are having with Ian in my head.
Ian mercilessly savages Laura from behind, below, and above, champagne showers, toe-sucking, and animal screams --
BACK TO ROB IN BED, imploding with disgust and sorrow.
Tears run down his cheeks into his ears.
ROB Number five -- Jackie Allen.
ROB My break up with Jackie Allen had no effect on my life whatsoever.
ROB I just slotted her in to bump you out of position, Laura.
ROB Yes, you do in fact make it into the top five.
ROB Welcome.
ROB And just to remind you, the list is in chronological order, not in the order of pain and suffering.
Dick and Barry are stocking the racks.
Rob stands at the register, rocking back and forth sort of like an idiot, to "Always and Forever" by the Commodores.
He is a mess.
FEMALE VOICE Hey.
Rob looks up to see a nineteen or twenty-year-old GIRL standing in front of him.
GIRL Do you have soul?
Rob smiles bitterly at her, clearly having a different meaning in mind.
ROB That all depends.
She kind of backs away and goes back to browsing.
The phone rings and Rob picks it up.
ROB Record Exchange...
ROB How many records...
ROB Right, well if you could bring them -- okay, well, where do you live?
ROB Right...
ROB how about now?
ROB I can come right over...
ROB Okay.
He hangs up and grabs his jacket.
Dick emerges from the back.
ROB Some lady's got some singles to sell.
ROB I'll be back in a half-hour.
Rob walks out.
Rob mounts the stairs and rings the doorbell.
The door opens, revealing a too-tan WOMAN in her late forties, in designer jeans and a T-shirt bearing a rhinestone peace sign.
She says nothing.
ROB Hi.
ROB You called about the records?
She turns and walks into the house, leaving the door open for him.
He follows her in and through a fabulous first floor, packed with big-bucks bourgeois: Rugs, art, and antiques:
She ushers Rob into a large study, and turns the light on.
He misses a breath.
The walls are lined with mahogany cases custom-built for CDs, albums, epicurean stereo components, a couple priceless vintage guitars -- every one of the thousands of items bear a little numbered sticker, like a museum.
She points to several boxes on the floor, full of hundreds of singles.
WOMAN Those.
Rob steps into the room like an Undeserving, and carefully drops to his knees to examine the singles, each pristine in a plastic sleeve: the original God Save the Queen by the Sex Pistols, original Otis Reddings, Elvis Presleys, James Browns, Jerry Lee Lewises, Beatles...
on and on.
The mother lode.
Rob is doing the best to control the onset of hyperventilation.
He dares a glance over his shoulder to her to see if this is a joke.
WOMAN What do you think?
ROB It's the best collection I've ever seen.
WOMAN Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
Rob's face goes funny.
He looks around for a hidden camera.
ROB These are worth at least, I don't know --
WOMAN I know what they're worth.
WOMAN Give me fifty and get them out.
ROB But you must have --
WOMAN I must have nothing.
WOMAN Their my husband's.
ROB And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
WOMAN He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.
WOMAN A friend of my daughter's.
WOMAN He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission.
WOMAN Which reminds me.
WOMAN Can you make sure you give me a five?
WOMAN I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
ROB It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
WOMAN Years.
WOMAN This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
Rob looks back at the records but avoids the trance.
ROB Look.
ROB Can I pay you properly?
ROB You don't have to tell him what you got.
ROB Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.
ROB Give it to charity.
ROB Or something.
WOMAN That wasn't part of the deal.
WOMAN I want to be poisonous but fair.
ROB Look...
ROB I...
ROB I'm sorry.
ROB I don't want to be any part of this.
WOMAN Suit yourself.
WOMAN There are plenty of others who will.
ROB That's why I'm trying to compromise.
ROB What about fifteen-hundred?
ROB They're worth five times that.
WOMAN Sixty.
ROB Thirteen hundred.
WOMAN Seventy-five.
ROB Eleven-hundred.
ROB That's my lowest offer.
WOMAN And I won't take a penny over ninety.
They start smiling at each other.
WOMAN With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
ROB I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
WOMAN Fine.
Rob half stands, then drops again for one last lingering look.
ROB Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
WOMAN Sure.
WOMAN Ten cents.
ROB Oh, come on!
ROB Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
WOMAN Okay.
WOMAN Because you took the trouble to come up here.
WOMAN And because you've got principles.
WOMAN But that's it.
WOMAN I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Rob comes down the stairs holding his single, and walks down the street talking to camera.
ROB How come I end up siding with the bad guy, the man who ran off to Jamaica with some nymphette?
ROB I just got left for someone else, so why can't I bring myself to feel whatever it is his wife is feeling?
ROB All I can see is that guy's face when he gets that pathetic check in the mail for those records, and I can't help but feel desperately, painfully sorry for him.
The bar where Al Capone used to party, and it looks about the same: colored lightbulbs, shadowboxes, deep plush booths and a stage for jazz.
Rob slumps back in a booth, stirring a drink with his finger.
After a beat, we hear a DOOR SLAM off camera, and Rob looks up with a bit of fear.
Heavy footsteps get louder and closer, until a shadow shrouds Rob -- LIZ stands in front of him.
She is enormous, and she is mad as hell.
Rob reflexively shrinks.
ROB What's the -- hey, Liz --
LIZ -- No, no, no, don't even.
LIZ I talked to Laura, Rob.
LIZ I talked to her and she gave me a little background.
LIZ And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
She turns and stomps toward the door.
Rob gets up and follows.
Rob comes out of the club and follows Liz.
She hears him and turns on him, punctuating with a finger in his chest.
LIZ To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!
LIZ Poor Rob!
LIZ Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.
LIZ You let me believe that!
ROB It's true!
LIZ Rob!
LIZ Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!
LIZ You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!
LIZ And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
ROB Well she --
She turns again and keeps walking, holding a defiant middle finger over her shoulder as she fades down the street.
Rob sits, rocking slightly with the movement of the train.
He stares at an OLD COUPLE who do not speak to each other.
ROB She's right, of course.
ROB I am a fucking asshole.
ROB I did and said those things.
ROB But before you judge, although you've probably already done so, go off for a minute and write down the top five worst things that you have done to your partner, even if -- especially if -- your partner doesn't know about them.
ROB Don't dress things up or try to explain them.
ROB Just write them down in the plainest language possible...
A LONG BEAT, even five or ten seconds.
ROB Pencils down.
ROB Okay, so who's the asshole now?
Saturday.
For the first time we see the place kind of busy.
Rob watches the room.
Barry is toward the back, talking to a CUSTOMER.
"Cruel to Be Kind" by Nick Lowe plays.
BARRY It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.
BARRY Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.
BARRY But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
CUSTOMER I have all of the others.
BARRY Oh really.
BARRY Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
CUSTOMER They always seemed...
BARRY They always seemed what?
BARRY They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.
BARRY They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.
BARRY I can't believe that you don't own that record.
BARRY That's insane.
He plucks it from the rack, and sticks it in the Customer's hand, who regards it with a bit a of shame.
CUSTOMER Well what about the new Echo --
BARRY Do not get ahead of yourself.
DICK is listening to a female customer, but he doesn't hear her voice.
The army bag with a red cross on it.
The ring-of-ivy tattoo around the wrist.
The monkey boots.
The eye shadow.
DICK thinking, calculating...
DICK The interesting thing about Green Day is that so much of their music is in truth directly influenced by, in my opinion, two bands.
FEMALE CUSTOMER The Clash.
DICK Correct.
DICK The Clash.
DICK But also the Stranglers.
FEMALE CUSTOMER Who?
DICK I think you would love the Stranglers...
Dick pulls a Stranglers record and puts it on the stereo.
Her brow furrows, and then she smiles.
FEMALE CUSTOMER This sounds great.
Dick smiles humbly.
Two people in the store turn and approach.
CUSTOMER Is this the new Green Day?
BARRY still talking to his Customer, who now has several CD's in his hand.
He looks at Barry with a mixture of hate and adoration.
BARRY That is perverse.
BARRY Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.
BARRY What about Television?
CUSTOMER I have a television.
Barry adds more records to the Customer's stack.
A FEW MINUTES LATER - ROB AND DICK stand behind the counter.
Rob holds a CD in his hand, and surveys the roaming customers with a semi-serious air of authority.
ROB I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
DICK Do it.
DICK Do it.
Rob pops the CD in and it begins to play...
He stands there with his arms folded, waiting.
After a moment, a Customer approaches.
CUSTOMER What is this?
ROB It's the Royal Trux.
CUSTOMER It's great.
ROB I know.
ROB'S POV of the room.
Something has caught his eye: a cropped head with a leopard skin pattern surfaces and disappears, like Nessie.
Rob's face gets hot and mad.
He jumps out from behind the counter.
ROB Dick, ring the man up...
He moves like a cat through the crowd.
Justin sees him coming and counters around the middle island and heads for the door.
Vince appears next to him, fiddling with his belt.
He sees Rob now, and he and Justin bolt for the door.
Rob doubles back.
Dick sees Vince and Justin too late.
Rob is right behind them and as they get out the door, he reaches...
and comes up with the back half of a skateboard.
Rob emerges behind them, Vince's skateboard in hand.
They have enough distance to bolt, but they can't leave that board behind.
ROB Okay, fuckos.
ROB How much is this deck worth to you, and how many CD's did you rip off?
ROB Can you do the math?
Justin pulls two CD's out and slides them over to Rob.
ROB And what about you, dork?
Vince pulls about six, and puts them down in a neutral spot.
Rob picks all of them up and starts looking through them.
Dicks pokes his head out of the door.
ROB Dick, call the police, please.
Vince and Justin look at each other.
ROB Eno import.
ROB Sigue Sigue Sputnik.
ROB Break beats.
ROB Serge Gainsbourg.
ROB Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett...
ROB What's going on here?
ROB Are you guys stealing for other people now?
VINCE Naw.
VINCE Those are for us.
ROB Oh really.
ROB You two are slamming to Nico now?
JUSTIN You're, like, so bigoted to look at us and, like, think you know what we listen to.
VINCE You got the CD's so can I have my board back?
ROB I think you have more.
VINCE Well we don't.
ROB I can't frisk you but the cops can.
Justin reaches down again into his baggy shorts and comes up with a tattered old book, "How To Make A Record."
He tosses it over.
ROB Jesus.
ROB That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!
ROB Was it just your criminal nature or what?
ROB Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
VINCE No, we...
JUSTIN We don't know how it works.
JUSTIN Nobody even knows, so we wanted to check it out in that mag.
Rob snorts.
JUSTIN Like, do you know how to actually make a CD?
Rob can't resist edifying them -- the curse of the underappreciated expert.
ROB Uh, yes I, like, do...
ROB It's simple.
ROB You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant.
ROB You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
VINCE Records are those big round black things, right?
ROB Fuck off.
Rob turns to go back in the store.
VINCE Hey, can I have my board?
Rob drops it and enters the store.
Barry emerges from the back with three opened bottles of beer as the last customer goes out the door...
The three lean against the bins, tired and smiling.
BARRY What?
ROB What do you mean, "what?"
BARRY What are you snickering about?
ROB I'm not snickering.
ROB I'm smiling.
ROB Because I'm happy.
BARRY What am I missing?
BARRY What do you have to be happy about?
DICK Well we rang $900 today.
ROB Yeah but more than that.
ROB I'm happy because I'm proud of us.
ROB Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
Dick and Barry look at each other.
They almost know how to take a compliment.
Rob, now alone, turns the sign from "open" to "closed" shuts the door behind him, and pulls the gate across.
Laura appears from the next doorway.
He jumps.
ROB Shit!
LAURA Hi.
ROB Hi.
LAURA I thought I could give you a lift back.
ROB Are you coming home?
LAURA Yes.
LAURA Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
ROB My house?
Laura turns and begins walking.
Rob looks at camera.
ROB First of all: The money.
ROB The money is easy to explain: She had it and I didn't, and she wanted to give it to me.
ROB If she hadn't, I would have gone under.
ROB I've never paid her back because I've never been able to, and just because she's took off and moved in with some Supertramp fan doesn't make me five grand richer.
ROB So that's the money --
Laura's CAR HORN is heard.
He heads off.
They move down the street, and it's a little tense.
Laura pushes a tape into the stereo.
Art Garfunkel's "Bright Eyes" begins to play.
Rob turns away from her and makes a face, but she knows he's making it.
LAURA You can make all the faces you want.
LAURA My car.
LAURA My car stereo.
LAURA My compilation tape.
Rob tries not to speak, but --
ROB How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?
ROB It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
LAURA It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.
LAURA Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
ROB -- Made.
ROB Made.
ROB Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
LAURA -- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.
LAURA Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are.
LAURA Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
ROB -- Alright, alright but --
LAURA -- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
He reels on her.
ROB Hey!
ROB Marvin Gaye!
ROB "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!
ROB Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
LAURA Is that right?
LAURA I'd like a word with him.
ROB But don't you remember?
LAURA I remember the song.
LAURA I just couldn't remember who sang it.
Rob shakes his head in disbelief.
LAURA I can see why you prefer Gaye to Garfunkel.
LAURA I get it, really.
LAURA But there are so many other things to worry about.
LAURA They're only records, and if one is better than the other, well, who cares, besides you and Barry and Dick?
LAURA I mean really, who gives a flying fuck?
Silence.
ROB You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now.
ROB When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.
ROB You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
LAURA Well, I liked you.
LAURA You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
ROB So you weren't interested in music at all?
LAURA Yeah, sure.
LAURA More so then than I am now.
LAURA That's life though, isn't it?
The car slows, and Laura parks.
ROB But Laura...
ROB that's me.
ROB That's all there is to me.
ROB There isn't anything else.
ROB If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
LAURA You really believe that?
Laura turns the engine off and unbuckles her seat belt.
ROB Yes.
ROB Look at me.
ROB Look at our -- the apartment.
ROB What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
LAURA And do you like it that way?
ROB Not really.
She half smiles.
LAURA Let's go in.
She gets out of the car.
Rob turns to camera, speaking quietly and urgently.
ROB Okay, Number two: The stuff I told her about being unhappy in the relationship, about half looking around for someone else: She tricked me into saying it.
ROB We were having this state of the union type conversation and she said, quite matter-of-factly, that we were pretty unhappy at the moment, and did I agree, and I said yes, and she asked whether I ever thought about meeting someone else.
ROB So I asked her if she ever thought about it, and she said of course, so I admitted that I daydream about it from time to time.
ROB Now I see that what we were really talking about was her and Ian, and she suckered me into absolving her.
ROB It was a sneaky lawyer's trick, and I fell for it, because she's much smarter than me.
He scrambles out of the car.
The lock turns and Rob enters, holding the door for Laura who slips by, her coat in her hands.
She glances down at the table by the door and sees Ian's envelope.
ROB You can take it with you if you want.
She slips it into her purse.
He stands facing her for a moment, then crosses to her, takes her coat and tosses it on a chair.
She opens the closet and takes out a big laundry sack.
LAURA Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
ROB Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
She begins putting books and other things into the bag...
LAURA You bet.
LAURA I've been saying that for years.
Having no comeback, Rob goes for the moral high ground.
ROB So.
ROB Where have you been staying for the last week?
LAURA I think you know that.
ROB Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
Laura looks suddenly tired and sad, and looks away.
LAURA I'm sorry.
LAURA I haven't been very fair to you.
LAURA That's why I came here to the store this evening.
LAURA I feel terrible, Rob.
LAURA This is really hard, you know.
ROB Good.
ROB So.
ROB Is it my job?
LAURA What?
LAURA Gimme a fucking break.
LAURA Is that what you think?
LAURA That your not big enough a deal for me?
LAURA Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
ROB I don't know.
ROB It's one of the things I thought of.
LAURA What were the others?
ROB Just the obvious stuff.
LAURA What's the obvious stuff?
ROB I don't know.
She stands and walks toward the bathroom.
LAURA I guess it's not that obvious, then.
ROB No.
As soon as she shuts the door behind her, he turns to camera.
ROB And number three: The Pregnancy.
ROB I didn't know she was pregnant.
ROB Of course I didn't.
ROB She hadn't told me because I had told her I was...
ROB sort of...
ROB seeing somebody else.
ROB We thought we were being very grown-up, but we were being preposterously naive, childish even, to think that one of us could fuck around and then own up to it while we were living together.
ROB So -- I didn't find out about it 'til way later.
ROB We were going through a good period and I made a crack about having kids and she burst into tears.
ROB I made her tell me what it was all about, and she did.
ROB I felt guilty and so I got angry.
ROB She told me that at the time I didn't look like a very good long- term bet.
ROB That it was a hard decision and she didn't see any point in consulting me about it...
ROB When the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big --
We hear the bathroom door open.
LAURA What?
ROB What, what?
Laura comes out with a toiletry bag and places it by the door.
LAURA Did you say something?
ROB No.
ROB So.
ROB Is it working out with Ian?
LAURA Rob.
LAURA Don't be childish.
ROB Why is that childish?
ROB Your living with the guy!
ROB I'm just asking how it's going.
LAURA I am not living with him.
LAURA I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing.
LAURA Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.
LAURA You know that, don't you?
LAURA I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.
LAURA And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.
LAURA But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.
LAURA Probably nothing.
ROB Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
Laura rolls her eyes and head off into the bedroom with the laundry bag.
Rob turns back to camera.
ROB -- When the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big lump like that, even the most shortsighted jerk, even the most self-deluding and self pitying of jilted, wounded lovers can see that there is some cause and effect going on here, that abortions and Ian and money and affairs all belong to, all deserve each other.
Laura reappears, her bag half-filled with clothes, and goes to the book shelves next to the records.
She starts topping off the bag with books.
LAURA Look.
LAURA Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.
LAURA Maybe I'll never see either of you again.
LAURA I don't know.
LAURA All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
ROB So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?
ROB There's still a chance we'll get back together?
LAURA I don't know.
ROB Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?
ROB It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?
ROB It means he might live.
ROB Even if it's only a remote possibility.
LAURA I suppose so.
ROB So we have a chance of getting back together again.
LAURA Oh, Rob, shut up.
ROB Hey, I just want to know where I stand.
ROB What chance --
LAURA -- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
She abandons her attempt at packing.
ROB Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
LAURA Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together.
LAURA Does that clarify the situation?
ROB Yeah.
ROB Great.
LAURA I'm too tired for this now.
LAURA I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?
LAURA I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
ROB No problem.
ROB If I can ask one question.
LAURA Fine.
LAURA One.
ROB It sounds stupid.
LAURA Nevermind.
ROB You won't like it.
LAURA Just ask it!
ROB Is it better?
LAURA Is what better?
LAURA Better than what?
ROB Well.
ROB Sex, I guess.
ROB Is sex with him better?
LAURA Jesus Christ, Rob.
LAURA Is that really what's bothering you?
ROB Of course it is.
LAURA You really think it would make a difference either way?
ROB I don't know.
LAURA Well the answer is that I don't know either.
LAURA We haven't done it yet.
ROB Never?
LAURA I haven't felt like it.
ROB But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
LAURA No.
LAURA I was living with you, remember?
LAURA We've slept together but we haven't made love.
LAURA Not yet.
LAURA But I'll tell you one thing.
LAURA The sleeping together is better.
ROB The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
LAURA Will you please just go?
Rob shuts the door behind him and does a crazy Charleston/Cabbage-Patch/Boxstep/Touchdown dance of pure elation, then bounces down the stairs.
Rob bounces along, a smile wider than we have seen yet.
Maybe even jumping to touch an awning.
He lands and tells us:
ROB I feel good!
ROB I feel great!
ROB I feel like a new man.
ROB I feel so much better, in fact --
Rob moves through the room, still grinning a bit like a proud new father, toward the table where Barry, Dick, Marie and T- Bone sit, listening to a story T-Bone is telling.
Marie turns to him.
ROB Hi, Marie.
MARIE Everything go alright?
Rob glances at Barry, who averts his gaze.
ROB She just wanted to pick up some stuff.
ROB No big thing.
ROB A relief, actually.
MARIE God, I hate that time.
MARIE That pick up stuff time.
MARIE I just went through that before I came here.
MARIE You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?
MARIE That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
ROB It's a great song.
MARIE Thank you.
Rob glances at T-Bone, his mind calculating the new info.
ROB Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?
ROB Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
MARIE Yup.
Marie slides closer, turning her back on the others.
The loop is closed.
ROB You share a place with T-Bone?
MARIE No way!
MARIE I'd cramp his style.
MARIE And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.
MARIE I'm way to unattached for that.
ROB I understand completely.
Rob and Marie lean in to each other, everyone else out of focus.
ROB (V.O.) Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
MARIE Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
ROB What do you mean, the Crumblers?
ROB You know the Crumblers?
ROB Nobody's heard the Crumblers.
ROB Except me.
MARIE Yeah, I know the Crumblers!
MARIE I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.
MARIE My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Rob glows --
ROB (V.O.) Books, records, films -- these things matter.
ROB (V.O.) Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
ROB Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
MARIE The Conformist.
ROB Exactly!
ROB Fucking ex-actly!
MARIE You haven't even seen it!
ROB Nor have you!
They just laugh and laugh --
ROB (V.O.) References, titles, lyrics, flew and met each other in mid-air embraces.
ROB (V.O.) The evening goes with breathtaking precision.
Rob and Marie are kissing standing up.
MARIE Are you okay?
ROB Yes.
ROB You?
MARIE For now.
MARIE But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
ROB I'm sure it isn't.
MARIE Good.
MARIE In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.
MARIE You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
ROB Whiskey.
Marie goes into the kitchen, and they keep talking around the corner.
MARIE Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
ROB I'd better go.
ROB I gotta get up early.
ROB Go over to my parents'.
MARIE When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know...
MARIE talking about breakfast and stuff.
She plants the whiskeys firmly on the coffee table.
MARIE I'd like it if you could stay the night.
ROB Oh, right.
ROB Alright.
MARIE Jesus, so much for delicacy.
MARIE I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
ROB I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
MARIE So you'll stay?
ROB Yeah.
MARIE Good.
Marie picks up the drinks again and exits to the bedroom.
Rob just stands there...
and the LIGHTING CHANGES.
ROB Over nine million men in this country have slept with ten or more women.
ROB And do they all look like Richard Gere?
ROB Are they all as rich as Bill Gates?
ROB Charming as Oscar Wilde?
ROB Hell no.
ROB Nothing to do with any of that.
ROB Maybe fifty or so have one or more of these attributes, but that still leaves...
ROB well, about nine million, give or take fifty.
ROB And they're just men.
ROB Regular guys.
ROB We're just guys, because I, even I, am a member of this exclusive, nine million member club.
ROB In fact, Marie is my seventeenth lover.
ROB "How does he do it?" you ask.
ROB "He wears bad sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke, he hangs out with the Musical Moron Twins, and he gets to go to bed with a recording artist who looks like Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan.
ROB What's going on?
ROB Listen up, because I think
I can explain, with all modesty aside: I ask questions.
That's it.
That's my secret.
It works precisely because that isn't how you're supposed to do it, if you listen to the collective male wisdom.
There are still enough old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs running around to make someone like me appear to be refreshingly different.
If you can't hack this simple strategy, there are some women out there, of course, who want to get pushed around, ignored and mowed over, but do you really want to be with them anyway?
...he goes through a door into the bedroom.
Marie is taking off her earrings.
ROB Would you like me to turn the lights out?
ROB Or would you like them on?
MARIE God, you ask a lot of questions.
Rob stares at the ceiling as Marie sleeps on next to him.
ROB (V.O.) But in the morning we were just two people, slightly hung-over, who were not in love, sharing the same space.
ROB (V.O.) And I feel...
Rob looks to the camera.
ROB Sex is about the only grown-up thing that I know how to do; It's weird, then, that it's the only thing that can make me feel like a ten-year- old.
The two of them come out of the building and into the street.
ROB Which way are you going?
MARIE That way.
MARIE You?
ROB That way.
MARIE And so it is.
MARIE I'll talk to you later.
ROB I'll call you.
MARIE Right.
Empty.
Dick prices records out on the floor.
Rob leans against the register.
Barry sits on a stool next to him.
They're top-fiving it.
Rob's heart isn't in it.
ROB Okay.
ROB Top five side one track ones.
ROB Number one...
ROB "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
BARRY Ehh.
ROB "Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run.
ROB "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
BARRY Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough.
BARRY Not at all.
BARRY Dick, did you hear that?
ROB Shut up.
ROB "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On.
ROB "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
BARRY Ooh!
BARRY A kind of recent record!
BARRY Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics!
BARRY Nice!
BARRY "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
DICK Rob.
DICK Phone.
DICK It's Laura.
Rob springs to his feet, takes the phone and walks to the end of the cord.
Deep breath.
ROB Hi.
LAURA Hi.
LAURA I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.
LAURA Have you seen them around?
ROB I'll look for 'em.
ROB How you doing?
LAURA I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
ROB Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.
ROB I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
LAURA We'll talk some other time.
ROB Great...
ROB That's great.
Rob comes back to the counter and hangs up the phone.
BARRY Rob!
BARRY What about the Beatles?
BARRY What about the fucking Rolling Stones?
BARRY What about fucking...
BARRY fucking...
BARRY Beethoven?
BARRY Track one side one of the Fifth Symphony?
BARRY You shouldn't be allowed to run a record shop.
BARRY You shouldn't be allowed to --
SFX: BARRY'S VOICE FADES OUT.
Rob's mouth slacks and he stares off.
ROB (V.O.) There's something different about the sound of her voice...
ROB (V.O.) And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.
ROB (V.O.) Yet.
ROB (V.O.) What does "yet" mean, anyway?
ROB (V.O.) "I haven't seen...
ROB (V.O.) Evil Dead II yet."
ROB (V.O.) What does that mean?
ROB (V.O.) It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
BARRY -- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
ROB -- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
Barry just looks at Rob.
He pulls out a Game Boy and begins playing.
ROB Just...
ROB come on, what would it mean to you?
ROB That sentence?
ROB "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
BARRY To me, it would mean that you're a liar.
BARRY You saw it twice.
BARRY Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.
BARRY We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
ROB Yeah, yeah, I know.
ROB But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think?
Barry shuts off the Game Boy.
BARRY I'd think you were a cinematic idiot.
BARRY And I'd feel sorry for you.
ROB No, but would you think, from that one sentence.
ROB That I was going to see it?
BARRY I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.
BARRY I don't understand any part of this conversation.
BARRY You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.
BARRY What am I supposed to say?
ROB Just listen to me.
ROB If I said to you --
BARRY "-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
ROB Would you...
ROB would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
BARRY Well...
BARRY you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
Rob brightens.
Barry finally considers.
BARRY ...But the word "yet..."
BARRY Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.
BARRY Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
ROB But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
BARRY How the fuck am I supposed to know that?
BARRY You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Rob darkens.
ROB Why would they care?
BARRY Because it's a brilliant film.
BARRY It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
They look at each other for a strange moment.
BARRY I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
ROB Let's pack it up.
ROB We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Barry stands.
BARRY Fine by me.
BARRY I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
ROB Ha.
DICK I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
BARRY Why?
Dick smiles sheepishly.
BARRY Who are you going to see?
DICK Nobody.
Barry's eyes widen.
BARRY Rob, looky looky.
BARRY Dick!
BARRY Are you getting some?!
Silence.
BARRY Un-fucking-believable.
BARRY Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
ROB How do you know about that?
BARRY Oh come on, Rob.
BARRY What am I, an idiot?
BARRY I'm more bothered by Dick's thing.
BARRY How did this happen, Dick?
BARRY What rational explanation can there possibly be?
BARRY What's her name?
Barry is going a little hard.
Dick shrinks back.
DICK Anna.
BARRY Anna who?
BARRY Anna Green Gables?
BARRY Anna Conda?
DICK Anna Moss.
BARRY Anna Moss.
BARRY Mossy.
BARRY The Mossy Thing.
BARRY The Swamp Thing.
BARRY Is she all green and furry?
ROB Shut the fuck up, Barry.
BARRY Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?
BARRY You two have to stick together now.
BARRY Boners United.
BARRY United in getting some.
Barry picks up his bag and heads for the door.
ROB Don't be sad, Barry.
ROB You'll find true love someday.
BARRY Suck my ass.
ROB Terrific.
Rob looks to Dick, who looks guilty.
ROB Don't worry about it, Dick.
ROB Barry's an asshole.
DICK Yeah...
DICK Well...
DICK I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
Dick exits.
Rob watches the door close behind him, and looks out over the empty store.
He TALKS TO CAMERA as he goes to the light switches and begins shutting them off, one by one...
ROB Why does it bother Barry that much that Dick is seeing someone?
ROB He's worried about how his life is turning out, and he's lonely, and lonely people are the bitterest of them all.
...until all the lights are out.
Rob's silhouette slips out the door.
A downpour is on.
Rob has himself wedged into a phone booth, the little kind.
ROB Hi.
ROB It's me...
ROB I'm right outside...
ROB I know...
ROB I know...
ROB I figured I could just walk you to the train and you could go...
ROB home.
ROB Or whatever it is...
ROB No!
ROB Of course not -- okay.
ROB I'll be right here.
Rob stands under the overhang, watching Laura walk the long hallway from the elevators to the door.
ROB (V.O.) Laura looks different.
ROB (V.O.) Less stress- out, more in control.
ROB (V.O.) Something has happened, maybe something real, or maybe something in her head.
ROB (V.O.) Whatever it is, you can see that she thinks she's started out on some new stage in her life.
ROB (V.O.) She hasn't.
ROB (V.O.) I'm not going to let her.
She emerges from doors, says something to him and they start walking, sharing her umbrella.
Rob and Laura have just sat down in a booth.
LAURA So, how are you?
ROB Have you slept with him yet?
LAURA I told you I slept with him.
ROB No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
LAURA Is that why you wanted to see me?
ROB I guess.
LAURA Oh, Rob.
LAURA What do you want me to say?
ROB I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
She looks past him.
LAURA I can't do that.
She starts to say something else but Rob is up and out.
Rob pushes through the rush hour raincoats, seeming to be the only one going his way.
Rob is soaking, slumped in his chair, his headphones on and the stereo lit up behind him.
He talks a little loud, due to the headphones.
ROB Tonight we're gonna figure out the five best angry songs about women.
ROB Let's go...
He holds up a stack of records and CDs.
ROB You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where?
ROB "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass."
ROB "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?
ROB Maybe a Liz Phair track.
ROB There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with.
ROB Some devil's advocate stuff.
ROB The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...
ROB But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.
ROB Ah.
ROB Dylan.
ROB Bob fucking Dylan.
ROB Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.
ROB He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
LAURA You must have known it would happen.
LAURA You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.
LAURA Like you said, I've been living with the guy.
LAURA We were bound to get around to it sometime.
She laughs a bit nervously.
LAURA And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?
LAURA The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...
LAURA Are you there?
LAURA What are you thinking?
ROB Nothing.
LAURA We can meet for another drink if you want.
LAURA So I can explain it better.
LAURA I owe you that much.
ROB Look, I gotta go.
ROB I work too, you know.
LAURA Will you call me?
ROB I don't have your number.
LAURA Call me at work.
LAURA We can arrange to meet properly.
LAURA I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.
LAURA I know what you're like.
ROB You do, huh.
He hangs up and stares at the wall for awhile.
He gets a beer from the fridge and sits back down.
He picks up the phone and dials.
ROB Yes, a residence, a Mr. Ian Raymond, North Side...
ROB thank you.
He writes down a number and hangs up, then looks to camera.
ROB You know the worst thing about being rejected?
ROB The complete lack of control due to loss of control.
He picks up the phone and dials, while continuing to talk to us --
ROB If I could only control the when and how of being dumped by somebody then it wouldn't seem as bad.
ROB But then, of course --
He hangs up quickly --
ROB -- it wouldn't be rejection, would it?
ROB It would be mutual consent.
ROB It would be musical differences.
ROB I would be pursuing a solo career.
Rob is tucked into a phone booth across the street.
He can see the silhouettes of Laura and Ian in the window.
He picks up the phone, drops a quarter, and hits the numbers hard as he dials...
a muffled male "hello?" is heard and Rob hangs up.
He does it again.
And again.
And again.
Until --
Still an unpacked box or two, but it's set up: a framed "Woodstock - The Movie" poster, stacks of new fiction, a bread maker -- you get the idea.
Ian is shorter than Laura, scruffier than Rob, and looks not unlike Leo Sayer/Steve Guttenberg.
He stares at Laura with amused exasperation.
She picks up the phone --
LAURA Hello.
ROB It's me.
LAURA I figured it was.
LAURA Where are you?
ROB I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.
ROB You're running.
ROB On the run.
ROB You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later.
ROB And with...
ROB him.
LAURA I'm not -- hold on...
She walks into another room, shutting the door behind her.
On a bookshelf is a picture of a younger Ian in a tunic, emoting on some college stage.
She turns it face down.
LAURA I'm not in love with Ian, okay?
She wanders over to the window, looking out absently.
She sees Rob down there at the phone booth.
ROB Are you still in love with me?
LAURA Jesus.
LAURA I do not know.
LAURA I'll talk to you later.
ROB Think about what I said.
ROB I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
LAURA I'm not experimenting.
LAURA Why don't you go experiment.
ROB I don't want to.
ROB Don't need to.
ROB I love you.
LAURA You don't ever think about other people?
ROB No...
ROB not really...
ROB I mean, I think about it...
ROB but no, I don't really think about it.
IAN Laura?
IAN Are you okay?
LAURA I am fine...
LAURA I gotta go.
LAURA Goodbye.
She clicks the phone off.
The door cracks and Ian sticks his head in.
IAN Are you sure you're okay?
She moves past him back into the apartment.
LAURA Yeah, I'm fine.
LAURA I'm off the phone.
IAN You look upset.
LAURA I'm upset, but I'm fine.
IAN Maybe I should talk to him.
LAURA Mmmm, no.
LAURA Not a good idea.
IAN Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
LAURA Nothing to resolve, Ian.
LAURA Let's get a drink.
She grabs her coat and opens the door.
The phone begins to ring.
LAURA C'mon, c'mon.
Rob stands on the sidewalk in the rain, Ian's building behind him and down a few doors.
ROB I wish I could be one of those guys who doesn't call, the kind of guy that gets broken up with and appears not to give a shit.
ROB He doesn't make an ass out of himself, or frighten anybody, and this week I've done both of those things.
ROB One day Laura's sorry and guilty, and the next she's scared and angry, and I'm entirely responsible for the transformation, and it doesn't do my case any good at all.
ROB I'd stop if I could but I --
His head turns at the sharp SOUND of a door opening -- Ian and Laura are coming out of the building.
He jumps behind a tree, peering around it as they fade down the street.
Rob sits alone, nursing a scotch.
Rob looks up into the mirror behind the bar and sees an older woman, MRS.
ASHWORTH, sitting alone a few stools down.
ROB Do I know you?
ALISON'S MOM I don't know.
Rob remembers, and his gaze has a new found seriousness.
ROB You're Mrs. Ashworth.
ROB I'm Rob.
ROB An old boyfriend of you're daughter's.
Alison's Mom's brow furrows and her face darkens.
ROB Alison's.
ALISON'S MOM Really.
ROB Long time ago.
ROB I was just thinking about her.
ROB I was her first boyfriend.
ALISON'S MOM What did you say your name was?
ROB Rob.
ROB Rob Gordon.
ROB Circa junior high...
ALISON'S MOM I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend.
ALISON'S MOM Kevin Bannister.
ROB You gotta be kidding me.
ALISON'S MOM That's right.
ALISON'S MOM Kevin.
ALISON'S MOM She's Mrs.
ALISON'S MOM Kevin Bannister.
ALISON'S MOM She lives in Australia.
She doesn't seem too happy that Alison lives in Australia.
Rob is thrilled.
ROB Really?
ROB Married Kevin?
ROB Her junior high sweetheart...
ROB What chance would I have had against that?
ROB None, no chance.
ROB That's just fate.
ALISON'S MOM I beg your pardon?
ROB Technically, I'm number one.
ROB I went out with her a week before Kevin did.
ROB Her first boyfriend.
ROB Me.
She stands.
ALISON'S MOM Well Rob, I'll tell her you said hello.
ALISON'S MOM If she remembers you.
Alison's Mom strolls out.
ROB I think she will.
ROB But it's okay if she doesn't.
ROB I'm fine now.
Rob turns to the bartender, smiling giddily.
Rob walks through Uptown toward the train.
ROB And suddenly I am fine.
ROB For the moment there is not one extra pound on my chest.
ROB This is fate.
ROB Alison married Kevin.
ROB You get it?
ROB That's fate.
ROB That's got nothing to do with me, that is beyond my control, beyond my fault...
Rob into camera, digging through a box, fishing through pictures and letters, concert tickets and other mementos.
He begins to assemble a small pile of pictures of women.
ROB I want to see the others on the Big Top Five.
ROB Penny, who wouldn't let me touch her and then went and had sex with that bastard Chris Thompson.
ROB Sarah, my partner in rejection who rejected me, and Charlie, who I have to thank for everything: my great job, my sexual self-confidence, the works.
ROB There's this Springsteen song, "Bobby Jean," off Born in the USA.
ROB About a girl who's left town years before and he's pissed off because he didn't know about it, and he wanted to say goodbye, tell her that he missed her, and wish her good luck.
ROB Well, I'd like my life to be like a Springsteen song.
ROB Just once.
ROB I know I'm not born to run, and it's clear that Halsted Street is nothing like Thunder Road, but feelings can't be that different, can they?
ROB I'd like to call up all those people and ask them how they are and whether they've forgiven me, and tell them that I have forgiven them.
ROB And say good luck, goodbye.
ROB No hard feelings.
ROB And then they'd feel good and I'd feel good.
ROB We'd all feel good.
ROB I'd feel clean, and calm, and ready to start again.
ROB That'd be good.
ROB Great even.
Rob holds an old crumpled address book in one hand and the phone in the other.
ROB Penny Hardwick?
ROB This is Rob Gordon...
ROB From High school...
ROB Yeah.
Rob and Penny walk out of the theater mid-conversation.
They look happy as they walk down the street.
ROB (V.O.) Penny is as beautiful as she was in high school when I broke it off with her because she wouldn't sleep with me.
ROB (V.O.) In fact she's even more beautiful, and really grown into herself.
A mid-scale trattoria.
Rob and Penny sit at table laughing and talking.
If we didn't know better we might think there is chemistry.
ROB (V.O.) She tells me about her life, and I get it.
ROB (V.O.) And I tell about mine, and she's interested.
ROB (V.O.) And then, with no real explanation, I just launch into it: I tell her about Laura and Ian, and Charlie and Marco, and about Alison Ashworth and Kevin Bannister...
ROB ...and you wanted to sleep with Chris Thompson instead of me, and...
ROB and I thought you could help me understand why it keeps happening, why I'm doomed to be left, doomed to be rejected and...
He slows to a stop.
We see Penny as she goes from happy to livid.
PENNY Rob.
PENNY I was crazy about you.
PENNY I wanted to sleep with you, one day, but not when I was sixteen.
PENNY When you broke up with me -- when you broke up with me -- because I was, to use your charming expression, tight, I cried and cried and I hated you.
PENNY And then that little shitbag asked me out, and I was too tired to fight him off, and it wasn't rape because I said okay, but it wasn't far off.
PENNY And I didn't have sex with anyone else until after college because I hated it so much.
PENNY And now you want to have a chat about rejection?
PENNY Well, fuck you, Rob.
Penny stands and leaves.
Rob just sits.
ROB So that's another one I don't have to worry about.
ROB I should have done this years ago.
Rob indicates to an off-screen waiter.
ROB Check...
Rob to camera.
ROB Sarah's easy to find.
ROB She still sends me Christmas cards with her address and phone number on them.
ROB They never say anything else, except for "Merry Christmas, Love Sarah."
ROB I send her equally blank ones back.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT - ROB'S POV of a door opening, revealing Sarah, a few years older but still pretty in her mousey way.
She looks at Rob with a bit too much in her eyes.
Rob and Sarah face each other over a half-eaten pizza.
SARAH I can't believe I left you for him...
SARAH Crazy.
Sarah looks down at her plate, shaking her head, blushing.
Rob looks uncomfortable.
This is more than he was looking for.
ROB Well...
ROB probably seemed like a good idea at the time.
She looks up again...
SARAH Probably.
SARAH I can't remember why, though.
...and back down again.
ROB (V.O.) I haven't got the heart for the rejection conversation.
ROB (V.O.) There are no hard feelings here, and I am glad that she ditched me, and not the other way around.
Sarah, in the doorway, smiles painfully.
It's clear she doesn't want to shut the door, but she does.
Rob turns and walks down the hall toward the door to the street as he talks
ROB I could've ended up having sex back there.
ROB And what better way to exorcize rejection demons than to screw the person who rejected you, right?
ROB But you wouldn't be sleeping with a person.
ROB You'd be sleeping with a whole sad single-person culture.
ROB It'd be like sleeping with Talia Shire in "Rocky" if you weren't Rocky.
CLOSE-UP: PHONE BOOK as Rob's finger moves down the column, then stops.
Rob looks up with a little shock, almost recoiling from the phone book.
Rob to camera.
ROB Charlie's in the fucking phone book.
ROB She has come to assume such an importance, I feel she should be living on Mars.
ROB She's an extraterrestrial, a ghost, a myth, not a person with an answering machine, in the phone book...
ROB I call and hang up on her voice mail a couple of times, then I leave my name and number and throw in a "long time-no- see..."
ROB I don't hear anything back from her for a few days.
ROB Now that's more like it, if you're talking about rejection: someone who won't even return your phone messages a decade after she rejected you.
Rob hears the door open as he stocks shelves, and turns.
It's Ian.
Rob reacts, gunfighter eyes.
ROB Can I help you?
IAN Hello, Rob.
IAN Remember me?
IAN I'm Ray.
IAN Ian.
Rob says nothing.
IAN I thought maybe we should talk.
IAN Sort a few things out?
Rob is disoriented on the way to angry.
Dick and Barry's ears perk up.
ROB What needs sorting out?
IAN Come on, Rob.
IAN My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
ROB Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
IAN We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.
IAN We're talking actionable harassment.
IAN Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
ROB Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
IAN We've noticed and we're glad.
IAN But, you know...
IAN how are we going to make peace here?
IAN We want to make things easier for you.
IAN What can we do?
IAN Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.
IAN I'd hate it if I lost her.
IAN But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.
IAN Do you see what I'm saying?
ROB Yeah.
IAN Good.
IAN So shall we leave it at that then?
ROB I dunno.
IAN Think about it, Rob.
Rob looking sure of himself, righteous.
IAN Good.
IAN So shall we leave it at that then?
ROB I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!
ROB Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
Ian leaves, rattled.
Same thing.
IAN Good.
IAN So shall we leave it at that then?
ROB We won't leave it, Ian.
ROB Not ever.
Rob springs toward Ian, but Barry blocks his way.
Dick helps hold Rob back.
DICK Don't do it, Rob!
BARRY He's not worth it!
Rob reaches a pointed finger over Barry's shoulder.
ROB Leave town.
ROB Leave the country, you little bitch, because you're gonna look back on walks by the house and ten phone calls a night as a golden age.
ROB Get ready, mutherfucker.
Ian trips backward and scurries out the door.
Rob, Dick, and Barry just beating the living shit out of Ian, Rodney King style.
Ian lies on the floor trying to cover himself.
Dick, already out of breath, breaks from the pack and jerks the air conditioner from the wall and hefts it over his head, preparing for the death blow.
IAN So shall we leave it at that then?
ROB I dunno.
IAN Think about it, Rob.
Ian walks out.
Rob looks spent.
He shuffles toward the back of the store.
Rob is laying on his back, staring at the ceiling.
Dick sticks his head in the door.
DICK Phone, Rob.
DICK Somebody named Charlie.
Rob pulls the phone into the bathroom and shuts the door.
BATHROOM Rob curls up with the phone.
ROB Hello?
Charlie looks even better than when we saw her in college.
CHARLIE Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call.
CHARLIE In LA on business.
CHARLIE You know how it gets.
ROB Yeah, sure...
CHARLIE Good.
CHARLIE Great.
CHARLIE Yeah...
CHARLIE Wow.
CHARLIE Rob Gordon.
CHARLIE Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
ROB Yeah.
ROB A billion.
ROB Right...
ROB How are you?
CHARLIE Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.
CHARLIE Listen.
CHARLIE Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?
CHARLIE I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man.
CHARLIE Are you a spare man?
ROB Uh...yes, at the moment.
CHARLIE Great.
CHARLIE Gotta go.
CHARLIE See you then.
Sexy version of a hip wine commercial: a small mid-thirties crowd of successful, beautiful people.
Rob sits at the table silently as the other guests talk and eat.
Rob's central activities are working his way through maybe a few too many wines making sure his cigarette smoke doesn't get in anyone's face.
His eyes occasionally dart around the table, but he says nothing to anyone.
Rob is a little too settled into the couch, somewhat bleary.
Everyone gone but the two of them, Charlie plops down into a chair across from Rob.
ROB Hey Charlie.
CHARLIE Hey Rob.
ROB Why did you break up with me for Marco?
CHARLIE Fuck!
CHARLIE I knew it!
CHARLIE You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
ROB Huh?
CHARLIE There's been a rash of them, recently.
CHARLIE I find it a little unnerving.
CHARLIE In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.
CHARLIE Do all men go through this?
ROB C'mon, just answer the question.
ROB You can say what you like.
ROB What the hell?
Charlie looks off at a corner of the ceiling, musters a look of "contemplation."
CHARLIE It's all kind of lost in the...
CHARLIE in the dense mists of time now...
CHARLIE It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.
CHARLIE In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.
CHARLIE It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.
CHARLIE You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.
CHARLIE Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.
CHARLIE And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful...
CHARLIE you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved...
CHARLIE and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous?
CHARLIE More sure of himself?
CHARLIE Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.
CHARLIE A little sunnier.
CHARLIE Sparkier.
CHARLIE I don't know.
CHARLIE You know what people are like at that age.
CHARLIE They make very superficial judgements.
CHARLIE Do you think that's superficial?
CHARLIE He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
ROB Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
CHARLIE Oh God, no.
CHARLIE I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Rob to camera.
ROB I wanted the works and I got it.
ROB None of Alison Ashworth's fate, none of Sarah's rewriting of history, and no reminder that I'd got all the rejection stuff a little backward, like I did about Penny.
ROB Just a perfectly clear explanation of why some people have it and some don't.
ROB All I've learned from Charlie is that maybe my one talent, my genius for being normal, is a little overrated.
Rob enters the already open store, in a bad mood, to find Barry putting up a poster.
It reads:
"BARRYTOWN/appearing Saturday night/Bucktown Pub"
BARRY Hey.
ROB What the fuck is that?
BARRY My band.
ROB What band?
BARRY The band that found me and asked me to join.
ROB You are not in a band, Barry.
ROB You are not a musician.
ROB And no posters.
BARRY Thanks for your support, Rob.
BARRY Really appreciate it.
ROB Barrytown.
ROB Barrytown?
ROB Is there no end to your arrogance?
BARRY I didn't make up the name.
BARRY It's the Steely Dan song.
BARRY And it was in The Commitments.
ROB You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
BARRY They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?
BARRY It wasn't my idea.
ROB That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
Barry says nothing.
ROB Isn't it?
BARRY That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes.
BARRY But --
ROB Great!
ROB That's fucking great!
ROB They only asked you to sing because of your name!
ROB You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
BARRY How many tickets can I put you down for?
ROB None.
ROB Christ!
BARRY You're not even coming?
ROB Of course I'm not coming.
ROB Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?
ROB Where is it?
ROB The fucking Bucktown Pub?
ROB Ha!
BARRY So much for friends, then.
BARRY You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
ROB Bitter?
ROB Because I'm not in Barrytown?
ROB You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.
ROB Just keep that out of my window.
Rob opens the door to find Laura filling a duffel bag in the living room.
LAURA I called and called but you were out.
LAURA I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
ROB Is that the last of it?
LAURA Yep.
LAURA I might have missed some stuff.
LAURA I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
ROB Those look heavy.
ROB Where's Ian?
LAURA He's at home.
LAURA Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.
LAURA I'm mortified, actually.
LAURA I'm really sorry.
LAURA He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
ROB It was kind of funny.
They smile.
LAURA I'm sure.
ROB You still together?
ROB Going all right?
LAURA I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
ROB That bad, eh?
LAURA You know what I mean.
Rob flops onto the couch and surveys the room.
ROB It's a dump, isn't it?
Laura sits down, on the other side of the couch.
LAURA Fix it up.
LAURA It'll make you feel better.
ROB I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?
ROB I mean, how much are you making now?
ROB Sixty?
ROB Seventy?
ROB And you were living in this shitty place.
LAURA You know I didn't mind.
LAURA And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
ROB I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?
ROB What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?
ROB What do you call him?
LAURA Ray.
LAURA I hate Ian.
ROB I hate him too.
ROB So I just call him "Mavis."
ROB Or "Sissyboy."
ROB Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
Laura starts laughing, laying on the couch on her back, very close to Rob.
Rob leans in, sort of looking down into her eyes.
ROB This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
LAURA You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.
LAURA But I already knew you could make me laugh.
LAURA It's everything else I don't know about.
ROB You know I'm a good person.
LAURA Mmm hmm.
ROB You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
LAURA Oh ho, so very infrequently.
He moves a little closer.
ROB You know my favorite beverage is your bath water.
She laughs.
He moves in, not really trying to kiss her but leaving the door open for her...
She almost goes for it, but instead gets to her feet.
LAURA Time to go.
She goes to her bags.
Rob points to a pile of CDs.
ROB Don't forget your CDs.
LAURA Those aren't mine.
ROB Sure they are.
LAURA They're not really, though, are they?
LAURA I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.
LAURA I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and...
LAURA they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?
LAURA That Sting record you bought for me...
LAURA that was a present for me.
LAURA I like Sting and you hate him.
LAURA But the rest of this stuff...
LAURA Who the hell is Nick Lowe?
LAURA Or Gram Parsons?
LAURA Or the Boredoms?
LAURA I don't know these people.
LAURA I...
ROB Okay, okay.
ROB I get the picture.
LAURA I'm sorry to go on about it.
LAURA But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
ROB I got it.
ROB You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
LAURA You're being deliberately obtuse.
ROB I guess I am.
LAURA Well, think about it.
She hefts the duffel bag, opens the door and exits.
ROB Fuck.
Rob to the camera.
ROB What's the point in thinking about it?
ROB If I ever have another relationship, I'll buy her, whoever she is, stuff that she oughta like but doesn't know about -- that's what new boyfriends are for.
ROB And hopefully I won't borrow money from her, or have an affair, and she won't need to have an abortion or run away with the neighborhood, and then there won't be anything to think about.
ROB Laura didn't run off with Ian because I bought her CDs she wasn't that keen on, and to pretend otherwise is just...
ROB just...
ROB psychowank.
ROB If she thinks that, then she's missing the Brazilian rainforest for the twigs.
ROB If I can't buy the Plastic People of the Universe's first album for new girlfriends, then I might as well give up, because I'm not sure I know how to do anything else.
Rob walks toward the record store, and looks into a Starbuck's window he passes.
He stops for a second, seeing Ian at the counter, chatting merrily with the espresso jockey.
Rob keeps walking.
Rob tosses his coat down and picks up the phone and dials...
LAURA Hello.
ROB Hey, how ya doin'?
No answer.
ROB Guess who I just saw, right by my store?
ROB Ian.
ROB In Starbuck's.
ROB Neat, huh?
LAURA I can't talk right now.
ROB God, that's a cold and a half.
ROB Maybe you should bet back in bed.
No response.
ROB Are you alright?
LAURA Pigsty.
ROB Don't worry about it.
ROB Just get into bed.
ROB Worry about that when you're better.
LAURA Pig died.
ROB Who the fuck's Pig?
LAURA My dad died.
LAURA My dad, my dad.
She hangs up.
Rob comes out of the back, in a daze.
Dick and Barry notice.
BARRY What's up?
ROB Laura.
ROB Her dad died.
BARRY Ooh.
BARRY Drag.
Barry goes back to his comic book and burrito.
DICK I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
ROB You're a horrible person, Barry.
ROB I mean it.
Barry looks up at him, shrugs, then gets an idea.
BARRY Hey.
BARRY Top five songs about death.
BARRY A Laura's Dad Tribute list.
Nobody can help thinking about it.
BARRY Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack."
BARRY The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right?
BARRY "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
DICK Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
BARRY -- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
ROB It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
BARRY Whatever.
BARRY Okay.
BARRY "Tell Laura I Love Her."
BARRY That'd bring the house down.
BARRY Laura's mom could sing it.
ROB Fuck off, Barry.
BARRY I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness.
BARRY And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
ROB Because it's in The Big Chill.
BARRY Haven't seen it.
ROB Liar.
ROB We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
BARRY Oh.
BARRY Right.
BARRY But I'd forgotten about that.
BARRY I wasn't biting the idea.
ROB Not really.
The phone RINGS.
Rob picks it up.
ROB Record Exchange.
Laura is curled up on the couch.
Dick and Barry keep listing.
LAURA I'm sorry.
ROB No, no.
ROB When are you going home?
LAURA In a minute.
LAURA When I get it together.
BARRY What about Sabbath?
BARRY Or Nirvana?
BARRY They're into death.
Rob tries to signal to them to shut up but they don't see him.
He moves as far away as the cord will let me.
ROB Can I do anything?
DICK "Abraham, Martin, and John."
DICK That's a nice one.
BARRY "Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz.
BARRY "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus.
BARRY It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
LAURA No.
LAURA No.
LAURA Mom wants you to come to the funeral.
LAURA It's on Friday.
ROB Me?
LAURA My dad liked you.
LAURA And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and...
LAURA oh, I don't know.
LAURA I don't really understand it.
LAURA I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.
LAURA It's like...
LAURA He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
ROB Do you want me to be there?
LAURA I don't care.
LAURA As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Rob is silent.
LAURA Look, are you coming or not?
ROB Yes, of course.
LAURA Liz'll give you a lift.
LAURA She knows where to go and everything...
LAURA I don't have time to talk, Rob.
LAURA I've got too much to do.
ROB Sure.
ROB I'll see you on Friday.
She hangs up.
BARRY "Goodbye Laura's dad/blah blah la di da di da/
BARRY Seems to me/you lived your life/like a dentist in the wind...
Rob stomps toward Barry, who jumps over the counter to keep singing --
THUNDERCLAPS and RAIN.
Rob is in a somber suit, looking through the windshield wipers as Liz drives.
ROB So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
LIZ It's a crematorium.
ROB You're kidding.
ROB A crematorium?
ROB Jesus.
LIZ What difference does it make?
ROB Is Ray going?
LIZ No.
LIZ They don't know him.
LIZ And Ken liked you.
LIZ Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.
LIZ It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
ROB Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Liz and Rob sit in the back of the dark, smallish nondenominational room.
At the front is a coffin, resting on a stand.
Laura, her younger sister JO, and her mother sit in the front row, listening to the MINISTER.
MINISTER ...Now and forever, Amen.
He nods "offstage," and a muffled mechanical noise is heard.
The coffin begins to lower through a trap door beneath it.
A low, baleful human HOWL is heard, starting quietly but gaining in volume.
ROB (V.O.) I hear something in Laura's voice, but I know what it is, and at that moment I want to go to her and offer to become a different person, to remove all trace of what is me, as long as she will let me look after her and try to make her feel better...
Rob stays back, watching mourners approach Laura and her mother, hugging them.
After awhile, Laura sees Rob through the throng, hanging back.
She breaks through and to him, holding him close for a long time...
ROB (V.O.) ...And when she let's go of me, I feel I don't need to become a different person.
ROB (V.O.) It's happened already.
A cozy old Victorian house, full of things -- furniture, paintings, ornaments, plants -- which don't go together but which have obviously been chosen with care and taste.
Rob and Liz stand, drinking wine.
Jo approaches them.
LIZ How are you?
JO I'm all right, I suppose.
JO And Mom's not too bad.
JO But Laura...
JO I dunno.
LIZ She's had a pretty rough few weeks already, without this.
LIZ It's hard when you're putting all of your efforts into one part of your life and it doesn't work out.
She glances at Rob, embarrassed.
ROB Don't mind me.
ROB No problem.
ROB Just pretend you're talking about somebody else.
Jo smiles, Liz gives him a look.
LIZ We are talking about somebody else.
LIZ Laura.
LIZ Laura and Ray, actually.
Rob begins to turn red.
Anger, sorrow, everything else building.
ROB Enough, Liz.
LIZ Enough of what?
ROB I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.
ROB Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.
ROB But you know, Liz...
ROB I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.
ROB And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
LIZ Maybe I've been a little unfair.
LIZ But is this really the time?
ROB Only because it's never the time.
ROB I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
LIZ If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Rob looks around the room, beginning to hyperventilate and near tears.
He sees Laura in a corner of the room surrounded by four or five mourners.
He crosses to them and breaks through to her.
ROB I'm sorry.
He breaks away from her and slips out the front door.
So darkened by weather that it is almost night, raining torrents and big sheets.
Rob emerges from the front door of Laura's parents' house and begins walking down the street, hands thrust into his pockets.
The rain almost immediately soaks him.
In the distance, Rob runs toward us.
As he gets to us we move with him down the street.
He is drenched.
We hear the rain, and his ragged breath.
Headlights appear behind him and backlight him, getting brighter as the sound of an engine gets louder.
Rob takes a look over his shoulder, looks desperately left and right, and vaults himself over a small brick wall and into a flower bed, landing on his back in the black wet earth.
The big drops of rain splash mud on his face, and he burrows deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back, panting and staring up at the sky.
Off-camera the car engine catches up, and a door opens and shuts.
He sighs and shuts his eyes...
He opens his eyes again, to see Laura's face, wet as well, staring down at him.
It is difficult to distinguish rain from tears.
LAURA Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
ROB Uh...
ROB No.
But Rob keeps lying there.
Laura pulls herself to a sitting position on the wall just above him.
LAURA You're soaking.
ROB Mmnn.
LAURA You're also an idiot.
Rob pulls his muddy self to his feet and sits on the wall next to her.
ROB I can see why you say that.
ROB Look, I'm sorry.
ROB I really am.
ROB The last thing I wanted was...
ROB that's why I left, because...
ROB I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and...
ROB look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.
ROB I just wanted you to know, that's all.
LAURA Thank you.
LAURA I appreciate it.
LAURA I can't reciprocate.
ROB What do you mean?
LAURA I didn't mess things up because I was scared.
LAURA I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.
LAURA And I needed something to snap me out of it.
ROB Sure, I understand.
ROB Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.
ROB You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
LAURA I don't want to go back.
ROB What do you want to do?
LAURA C'mon.
They swing their legs over the wall and walk to Laura's VW.
They drive sort of aimlessly through Laura's old neighborhood.
Laura sees something on her left, and makes a sudden turn up a narrow road through some overgrown trees.
They come to a stop in a formerly paved clearing, looking out on a field with an old abandoned school on the other side.
Laura shuts down the engine.
ROB When are you going back?
LAURA I don't know.
LAURA Sometime.
LAURA Later.
LAURA Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
ROB What?
LAURA I want to feel something else than this.
LAURA It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.
LAURA Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
ROB I've only got a couple left.
ROB I'm saving them for later.
LAURA It'll have to be sex, then.
She pulls herself over him, staddling him in the passenger seat and kissing his neck.
She pauses and regards him from above.
LAURA Hello.
LAURA It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
ROB Hi.
LAURA I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Laura reaches down and unzips his pants, as they keep kissing.
ROB You know, with Ray...
LAURA Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
ROB No, no.
ROB It's not...
ROB are you still on the pill?
LAURA Yes, of course.
LAURA There's nothing to worry about.
ROB I didn't mean that.
ROB I mean...
ROB was that all you used?
Laura looks at him, motionless, then begins to cry.
ROB Look, we can do other things.
LAURA I lived with you.
LAURA You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.
LAURA Isn't that a terrible thing?
LAURA Isn't that sad?
She rolls off of him into her seat.
They sit there in silence, watching the rain run down the windshield.
Rob to camera.
ROB Later, I wonder if I was really worried about where Ian has been.
ROB I have no idea where he's been, and that gives me every right to insist on protection.
ROB But in truth, it was the power that interested me more than the fear.
ROB I wanted to hurt her, on this day of all days, just because it's the first time since she's left that I've been able to.
Rob and Laura lean back in a booth, facing each other.
We get that feeling that not another word has been spoken since we last saw them.
ROB Laura...
LAURA I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Rob leans forward.
ROB So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.
ROB But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
LAURA Everything's too hard.
LAURA Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
ROB What about Ian?
LAURA Ray's a disaster.
LAURA I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
ROB Mission accomplished.
LAURA I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.
LAURA I just...
LAURA I need you, Rob.
LAURA That's it.
LAURA And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
She looks up at him.
LAURA Let's go home.
LAURA Okay?
ROB Okay.
Rob to camera.
ROB But wouldn't you know it?
ROB Suddenly I feel panicky, and sick, and I want to run around and sleep with female recording artists...
Post-lovemaking.
Rob and Laura lie on their backs.
ROB C'mon.
ROB I want to know.
LAURA Want to know what, exactly?
ROB What it was like.
LAURA It was like sex.
LAURA What else could it be like?
ROB Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
LAURA What's the difference?
ROB You know the difference.
LAURA Look, we're okay now.
LAURA We just had a nice time.
LAURA Let's leave it at that.
ROB Okay, that's cool, okay.
ROB But the nice time we just had...
ROB was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
Laura is silent.
ROB Oh, c'mon, Laura.
ROB Just say something.
ROB Lie, if you want.
ROB It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
LAURA Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
ROB Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
LAURA To make you feel better.
ROB Oh, great...
Rob begins to get out of bed.
She grabs his hand and pulls him back down.
LAURA Look, Rob.
LAURA If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now.
LAURA And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
ROB Okay.
She pulls him close and they lie there, the matter seemingly settled.
LAURA I wish your penis was as big as his, though.
He turns slowly to her.
A giggle from her turns into a laugh, then a howl, a roar --
Rob and Laura walk the cement breakfront.
LAURA ...
LAURA Like Mexico.
LAURA Or Jamaica.
LAURA Or New York, even.
ROB Hey, great idea.
ROB What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
LAURA I'll pay for you.
LAURA Even though you owe me money.
LAURA We have to do something with the money I earn.
LAURA I need to.
LAURA I deserve it.
LAURA You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
ROB Fantastic.
ROB The Girlfriend Lottery.
LAURA Money does not matter.
LAURA I do not care how much you earn.
LAURA I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
ROB But it wasn't supposed to be like this.
ROB When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
LAURA How?
LAURA How were we the same people?
ROB Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.
ROB You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I. And I still do, and you don't.
LAURA Because I'm not allowed to.
LAURA I still do, after work.
LAURA So, what?
LAURA Should we just break up?
LAURA Is that what you're saying?
LAURA Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
ROB No, but...
LAURA But what?
ROB But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
LAURA You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.
LAURA If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
ROB And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
LAURA I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.
LAURA And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
ROB You're tougher.
LAURA More confident, maybe.
ROB Harder.
LAURA Less neurotic.
LAURA Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
ROB I'm alright.
LAURA Yeah, you're alright.
LAURA But you're certainly not happy.
LAURA So what happens if you get happy?
LAURA And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention.
LAURA Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?
LAURA What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success?
LAURA Time for a new girlfriend?
ROB You're being stupid.
LAURA How?
LAURA What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
Rob is silent.
LAURA All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.
LAURA Otherwise, what's the use?
ROB No use.
Rob comes out of the stock room and walks toward the counter where Dick and Barry stare at the tape deck like two concerned doctors, listening to a song that is raw and moody and lyrical -- Minor Threat meets Brian Eno, if that's possible.
Rob joins them in contemplation.
ROB What is this.
DICK It's Vince and Justin.
ROB Who's that?
BARRY The little skate-fuckers.
ROB No way.
BARRY Yes way.
BARRY It's really...
Rob and Dick look at him, ready to pounce --
BARRY It's really fucking good.
Dick and Barry look to Rob, who continues to just listen...
He takes a deep breath and walks to the front door and out, seemingly with a mission.
Vince and Justin are doing noisy skate tricks against the curb across the street.
When they see Rob they stop, get ready to flee.
He walks across to them.
Dick comes out and hovers in the background.
ROB Your tape.
ROB It's good.
They mumble thanks.
ROB It's rough.
ROB But it shows promise.
ROB We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.
ROB I'll take care of the rest.
ROB I'll put out your record.
ROB Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
VINCE Wait a minute.
VINCE Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
ROB We're not there yet, Justin.
VINCE I'm Vince.
ROB Whatever.
He begins to move toward the store.
Vince and Justin look at each other.
Rob gets to the door but stops and turns.
ROB Hey.
ROB What's the name of your band?
JUSTIN The Kinky Wizards.
ROB What?
VINCE We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
ROB Nice.
VINCE What's the name of your label?
Rob looks at them.
Then at Dick.
Then through the window at Barry, inside looking out.
Then at his own reflection in the window.
Then back at them.
ROB Broken Records.
ROB Welcome aboard.
Rob walks back inside.
He seems to be shaking a little.
BARRY What the fuck is that?
ROB What?
BARRY I heard you, man.
BARRY Don't give me that "what" shit.
BARRY You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
ROB So?
ROB You even said they're good.
BARRY HELLO.
BARRY DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?
BARRY Mr.
BARRY Phil Spector?
Rob waves him off and disappears into the stock room.
Laura enters.
LAURA Hey, Barry.
BARRY Oh, hi.
LAURA Where's Rob?
BARRY The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.
BARRY Do you have an appointment?
LAURA What are you talking about?
BARRY Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.
BARRY That's all.
Laura puts it together, and smiles.
She goes to the back and crack the door, finding Rob sitting on a box, thinking.
ROB Hi.
LAURA Hi.
LAURA What are you doing?
ROB Nothing.
LAURA Wanna go to dinner?
ROB Where?
LAURA At Paul and Miranda's.
LAURA Paul from work.
ROB Oh.
ROB Well.
ROB We don't really get along.
ROB Paul and I.
LAURA I know.
LAURA But you've never met.
LAURA It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
ROB Ha.
Rob to camera.
ROB We're at a point where I can't really walk away from gauntlets she might throw down, and so I go.
ROB And wouldn't you know it, I sort of fall in love with Paul and Miranda -- with what they have, and the way they treat each other, and the way they make me feel as if I'm the new center of their world.
ROB I think they're great, and I want to see them twice a week, every week, for the rest of my life.
ROB Only right at the end of the evening do I realize I've been set up.
After dinner.
Rob ambles in from the dining room.
Laura close behind.
He looks through the bookshelves until he finds a meager little grouping of CDs.
He moves up to them and scans the titles: Tina Turner.
Billy Joel.
Kate Bush.
Pink Floyd.
Simply Red.
The Beatles.
The Windham Hill Sampler...
PAUL Lame, right?
Rob turns around to see PAUL behind him.
ROB Oh, I don't know.
ROB The Beatles are okay.
Paul laughs.
PAUL We're kinda out of date.
ROB Hey, to each his own, I say.
PAUL Maybe we can come by your store and you can hook us up.
ROB Sure, sure.
ROB Any time.
LAURA Better hurry, though, Paul.
LAURA Rob started a record label, so he's gonna be in the shop less and less.
Rob looks at her.
INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT as they come in the door.
LAURA ..."
LAURA To each his own!" Unbelievable!
LAURA You!
LAURA Rob Gordon said that.
LAURA You even sounded like you meant it.
They throw their jackets over a chair.
Rob turns on the CD player and "Call Me A Liar" by Palace begins to play.
ROB You did that deliberately.
ROB You knew all along I'd like them.
ROB It was a trick.
LAURA I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.
LAURA I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
She moves to Rob and wraps her arms around him.
They look deeply at each other.
She breaks away from him and walks into the bedroom.
He turns off the stereo and follows her.
Rob walks to work, drinking his coffee.
He stops and backs up a few feet, and stares at a poster on a plywood board-up.
"'I SOLD MY MOM'S WHEELCHAIR'/the debut single from The Kinky Wizards/on Broken Records/Record release party July 20 at The Artful Dodger/Featuring the triumphant return of DJ ROB GORDON/"Dance Music For Old People"
Rob scowls, and storms off.
Rob paces, Laura sits on the couch, smiling.
LAURA I called Dan Koretzky because he --
ROB Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.
ROB You told Dan Koretzky about this?
LAURA Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.
LAURA Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally."
LAURA He helped me put out a press release.
LAURA Just local, of course.
ROB And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
LAURA I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.
LAURA It might even be why I came back.
ROB You had no right.
ROB Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
LAURA What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
ROB That's not the point.
ROB I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
LAURA Barry said its done.
ROB Barry?
ROB Barry knows about this?
LAURA Yeah.
LAURA His band is playing a set.
Rob wheels on her.
Rob and Barry.
ROB Like fuck you are.
BARRY Laura said we could.
BARRY If we helped out with the posters and stuff.
BARRY And we did.
BARRY And we are.
ROB I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
BARRY We're getting that anyway.
ROB What is she doing?
ROB Okay, 20%.
BARRY No.
BARRY We need the gig.
ROB 110%.
ROB That's my final offer.
ROB I'm not kidding.
ROB That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
BARRY We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
ROB You couldn't be.
ROB Look, Barry.
ROB There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.
ROB How are you going to cope with them?
BARRY We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.
BARRY They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.
BARRY We're called SDM.
BARRY Sonic Death Monkey.
ROB Sonic Death Monkey.
BARRY What do you think?
BARRY Dick likes it.
ROB Barry, you're over thirty years old.
ROB You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
BARRY I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.
BARRY Over the edge, in fact.
ROB You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
BARRY That's what we want.
BARRY Reaction.
BARRY And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.
BARRY Let 'em riot, we can handle it.
BARRY We'll be ready.
Barry wanders off laughing.
Rob and Laura.
LAURA They'll go on early.
LAURA Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
ROB It's no joke.
ROB I'm responsible for what happens, you know.
ROB Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.
ROB I have to put down a deposit for the room.
ROB I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
LAURA We took care of that.
Rob's brow furrows.
LAURA Barry and Dick and me.
LAURA Look in the bedroom.
Rob goes to the bedroom door and opens it.
It's sort of like Christmas: hundreds of Kinky Wizards CD singles, painstakingly packaged and stacked on the bed.
Rob to camera.
ROB I suddenly feel choked up.
ROB It's not the money, it's the way she's thought of everything: one morning I woke up to find her going through my records, pulling out things that she remembered me playing when I deejayed and putting them into the little carrying cases that I used to use and put away in a closet somewhere years ago.
ROB She knew I needed a kick in the ass.
ROB She also knew how happy I was when I used to deejay.
ROB From which every angle I examine it, it still looks as though she's done all of this because she loves me.
Rob turns from the bedroom and goes to Laura, putting his arms around her.
ROB I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.
ROB I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
LAURA That's okay.
LAURA You seem pissed off all the time, though.
ROB I know.
ROB I don't get it.
Rob to camera.
ROB But if I had to take a wild guess, I'd say that I'm pissed because I know I'm stuck with Laura, bound to her, and I don't like it.
ROB That dreamy anticipation you have when you're fifteen or twenty or thirty even, that the most perfect person in the world might walk into your store or office or friend's party at any moment...
ROB That's all gone, I think, and that's enough to piss anybody off.
ROB Laura is who I am now, and it's no good pretending otherwise...
Rob is standing shelves.
A very pretty young woman, CAROLINE, comes through the door and looks around.
She sees Rob.
CAROLINE Excuse me?
Rob looks up and takes her in like a dish in a window.
ROB May I help you?
CAROLINE I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
ROB Uh.
ROB That's me.
CAROLINE I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader.
CAROLINE I want to do a story on you.
ROB Right.
ROB Why?
CAROLINE Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
ROB Oh.
ROB Okay.
CAROLINE I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
ROB Huh.
ROB You used to come to the club?
ROB I shouldn't have let you in.
ROB You must have only been about sixteen.
Rob realizes what he must be sounding like.
He blushes and retreats.
ROB What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.
ROB You don't.
ROB You don't look old either.
ROB You look just as old as you are.
ROB A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.
ROB Not much.
ROB Just right.
CAROLINE So.
CAROLINE Is now a good time?
Rob looks around: there is absolutely nothing going on in the store.
He nods.
She pulls out a pad and pencil.
CAROLINE Right.
CAROLINE So.
CAROLINE You must have an enormous record collection.
ROB Yeah.
ROB I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
He winces immediately.
CAROLINE Yeah, well...
CAROLINE Let's see...
CAROLINE What are you're all-time top five records?
ROB Pardon me?
CAROLINE Your desert island top-five.
ROB Oh boy...
ROB In the club, or at home?
CAROLINE Is there a difference?
ROB OF COURSE...
ROB Well yeah, a bit.
ROB "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.
ROB It's a country-rock ballad.
ROB Everybody'd go home.
CAROLINE Nevermind.
CAROLINE Any five.
CAROLINE So four more.
ROB What do you mean, four more?
CAROLINE Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
ROB Can I go home and work this out and let you know?
ROB In a week or so?
CAROLINE Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.
CAROLINE I'll do one.
CAROLINE My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Rob is aghast, humiliated, quietly outraged.
ROB Oh, I'm sure I can manage something...
ROB "Sin City."
ROB "New Rose," by The Damned.
ROB "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic.
ROB "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway...
ROB um...
ROB "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley...
ROB And...
ROB "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.
ROB A bit controversial, I know, but...
CAROLINE Fine.
CAROLINE That's great.
ROB Is that it?
CAROLINE Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
ROB Sure, but is that it for the list?
CAROLINE That's five.
CAROLINE So.
CAROLINE Why did you decide to deejay again?
ROB Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.
ROB So...
ROB I should really put a James Brown in there --
CAROLINE Nice friend.
ROB Yeah.
CAROLINE What's his name?
ROB Who?
ROB Oh.
ROB My friend.
ROB My friend is Laura.
ROB A girl.
ROB A friend who's a girl.
CAROLINE "Music for Old People."
CAROLINE What does that mean?
ROB Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.
ROB Instead of "Sin City."
She scribbles and writes.
CAROLINE Okay.
CAROLINE "Dance Music For Old People?"
ROB Oh, you know...
ROB a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.
ROB They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
CAROLINE And the new label?
CAROLINE And the Kinky Wizards?
ROB Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?
ROB Why don't I just make you a tape?
CAROLINE Would you?
CAROLINE Really?
CAROLINE Wow.
CAROLINE I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
ROB Haha.
ROB Right.
ROB It's no problem.
ROB I love making tapes.
Rob to camera.
ROB A good compilation tape, like breaking up, is hard to do and takes ages longer than it might seem.
ROB You gotta kick off with a killer, to hold the attention.
ROB Then you have to take it up a notch, but not blow your wad, so maybe cool it off a notch, and you can't put the same artist twice on the tape, except if some subtle point or lesson or theme involved, and even then not the two of them in a row, and you can't woo somebody with Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow Taxi" and then bash their head off with something like GBH's "City Baby Attacked by Rats," and...
ROB oh, there are a lot of rules.
ROB Anyway, I worked hard at this one.
Rob sits Indian-style on the floor in front of the stereo.
He has a pad of paper with scrawled titles and cross-outs, and is surrounded by piles of CDs and records.
LAURA Who's that for?
Rob winces, turns.
He's busted.
ROB This?
ROB Oh, just that woman who interviewed me for The Reader.
ROB Carol?
ROB Caroline?
ROB Something like that.
Laura turns and walks out of the room.
Rob is tucked into the corner, on the phone.
ROB Hi, Caroline...
ROB Oh, it's Rob.
ROB Yeah, listen, I have a new list for you and -- Oh.
ROB Yes.
ROB Of course...
ROB Well maybe next week they could print a, uh, retraction.
ROB Or a correction.
ROB Because the list I have now it really much more -- right.
ROB Okay.
ROB Anyway, I have your tape.
ROB That's right.
ROB Shall I mail it to you?
ROB Or...
ROB would you like to have a drink?
Rob to camera.
ROB How are you not going to fall for someone who wants to interview you?
ROB Now Caroline is all I can think about.
ROB And in the daydreams I imagine every detail, the entire story of our future relationship, until suddenly I realize that there's nothing left to actually, like, happen.
ROB I've done it all, lived through it all in my head.
ROB I know the whole plot, the ending, and the good parts.
ROB Now I'd have to watch it all over again in real time, and where's the fun in that?
ROB And fucking--when is it all going to stop?
ROB Am I going to jump from rock to rock for the rest of my life until there aren't any rocks left?
ROB Am I going to bolt every time I get itchy feet?
ROB Because I get them about once a quarter, along with the store's tax bill.
ROB I've been thinking with my guts since I was fourteen years old and, frankly speaking, I've come to the conclusion that my guts have shit for brains.
ROB You know what's wrong with Laura, what my problem is?
ROB What's wrong with Laura is that I'll never see her for the first or second or third time.
ROB That's all.
ROB Fuck it.
ROB I'll probably mail the tape.
ROB Probably.
Rob sits at a table in the bar, nervous.
He watches the door, sits up straight when it opens, and follows someone with his eyes, all the way to his table.
She sits.
It's Laura.
LAURA A drinking lunch on a school day.
LAURA What a nice surprise.
Rob says nothing.
LAURA Are you worried about tomorrow night?
ROB Not really.
He plays with his drink.
LAURA Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
ROB I'm going to talk to you.
LAURA Right.
He plays with his drink some more.
LAURA What are you going to talk to me about?
ROB I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.
ROB To me.
LAURA Ha ha ha.
LAURA Hoo hoo hoo.
ROB I mean it.
LAURA I know.
ROB Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
LAURA I'm sorry.
LAURA But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
ROB Not in love, exactly, but...
LAURA Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
ROB Would you marry me if I was?
LAURA No.
LAURA Probably not.
ROB Right.
ROB Okay, then.
ROB Shall we go?
LAURA Don't sulk.
LAURA What brought all this on?
ROB I don't know.
LAURA Very persuasive.
ROB Are you persuadable?
LAURA No.
LAURA I don't think so.
LAURA I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days.
LAURA Fair enough?
ROB Fair enough.
LAURA So?
ROB I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
LAURA About what?
ROB This stuff.
ROB Love and marriage.
ROB I want to think about something else.
LAURA I've changed my mind.
LAURA That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.
LAURA I do.
LAURA I will.
ROB Shut up.
ROB I'm only trying to explain.
LAURA I mean, maybe you're right.
LAURA But were you really expecting me to say yes?
ROB I dunno.
ROB Didn't think about it, really.
ROB It was the asking that was the important thing.
LAURA Well, you've asked.
She leans over and takes his hands in hers, smiles at him.
LAURA Thank you.
TWO TURNTABLES with the mixer in the middle.
"Just Begun" by Jimmy Castor spins on turntable #1.
A hand reaches in, and begins to draw the slides down, quieting the music.
Rob looks up from behind the deejay table, set up amongst the instruments.
The place is packed with people, and everyone seems to be having a great time.
Almost everyone -- Rob sees Barry, who pretends to nod off when Rob catches his eye, and Justin, who looks back at him and mocks a bulimic act.
Rob gives him the finger.
He sees Laura, and she beams at him.
He comes to the front of the stage, and taps a microphone.
ROB Uh, thanks for uh, coming out tonight.
ROB I hope you have a good time.
ROB And I hope you like the record.
ROB The one by the Kinky Wizards.
ROB The record that we're having this record release party for.
ROB Thanks.
ROB Listen to it first, though.
ROB Okay.
ROB We'll get to that later.
ROB Right now, I'd like to introduce...
ROB Sonic Death Monkey.
Good-natured applause.
Rob steps down and bee-lines to Laura.
Barry and his crew mount the stage.
Rob takes a big gulp of beer.
ROB I'm an idiot.
ROB I should have played the record first.
ROB This place is about to get burned down.
LAURA It's gonna be fine.
LAURA These people are ready for anything.
BARRY Yeah, well...
Barry stands in front of the mic, surveying the crowd with a smile.
He and the band all wear suits and ties.
BARRY Thanks for the enthusiastic intro, Rob.
BARRY We're not called Sonic Death Monkey anymore, though, ladies and gentlemen.
BARRY We might be on the verge of becoming the Atavistics, but we haven't decided yet.
BARRY But tonight, we are...
BARRY BARRY JIVE AND THE UPTOWN FIVE!
BARRY ONE TWO THREE --And they launch into Marvin Gaye's "Got To Give It Up," almost flawlessly faithful to the original.
BARRY Barry is transformed -- shuffling footwork, a wide smile, and when the intro winds up, an almost perfect falsetto.
BARRY The crowd goes nuts, filling the floor.
BARRY Rob is stunned, begins to smile.
BARRY Laura takes his hand and leads him out into the crowd...
