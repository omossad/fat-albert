ANNA KARENINA
Written by
Tom Stoppard
Based on the novel by Leo Tolstoy.
CLOSE--Expert fingers--female, unlovely, capable--shape a small lump of dough which, with some shreds of cabbage, becomes a filled bun called a pirozhok .
which is now placed on a baking tray to join rows of pirozhoki ready for the oven.
CLOSE-- One hand opens the oven, and, mittened by an apron, removes a tray of perfectly baked pirozhoki, which the other hand replaces with the fresh tray .
slightly burning itself on a knuckle.
Agafia sucks her knuckle and checks what's cooking on the stove-top.
She is the cook-housekeeper.
AGAFIA He needs to come in if he's to wash himself.
A Kitchen Maid at the sink obediently dries her hands on her apron.
A dozing dog, Laska, pricks up her ears.
It's snowing.
The Kitchen Maid, shawled, with a lantern, makes her way across the yard towards the cowshed, a short distance, and pushes open the frozen door.
Laska is at her heels, but is made to stay outside.
The herd stirs at the lantern light.
The bull, Berkut, with a ring through his nose, snorts as the girl goes by.
At the back of the shed a cow is calving.
Levin is midwifing, sleeves pulled back, blood and slime up to his elbows.
He is 34.
His steward, Vasili, holds up a lantern.
Levin pulls carefully at the emerging forefeet.
LEVIN Good girl .
LEVIN good girl, Pava.
The calf's head emerges.
KITCHEN MAID Agafia Mishaylovna says dinner's like to spoil.
The calf enters the world like a diver.
Levin is feeling great pride and pleasure.
LEVIN her father's colour.
VASILI Worth coming home for, Konstantin Dmitrich!
LEVIN I stayed too long in Moscow.
The cow nuzzles and licks her calf.
Cleaned up, in a smock shirt, Levin bites hungrily into a pirozhok, talking.
He has a book on a book-rest.
Agafia ladles soup for him.
Three generations of family portraits look down on him.
LEVIN She's a beauty.
LEVIN That's twelve cows sired by Berkut!
AGAFIA So one of you is doing what the good Lord made you for.
Levin evades, ducks into spooning up soup, finding his place in his book.
Agafia goes out.
Alone, Levin closes the book and stares into himself.
CLOSE--Expert fingers scrape a cut-throat razor across a lathered cheek .
and again, skirting luxuriant facial hair on pampered skin.
There is a door to the landing and a door to the bedroom.
Prince Stepan Oblonsky-- Stiva to his friends--is 34 and liked by every- body.
A barber comes in every morning to shave him.
His valet, Matvey, is older and almost a friend.
He holds up an enormous pear.
MATVEY What should I do with this?
Oblonsky puts the barber on hold to have a look.
OBLONSKY Where did you find it?
MATVEY In your hat.
MATVEY Your Excellency.
Oblonsky thinks about it, lets the barber finish.
He stands and removes his dressing gown.
OBLONSKY Yes .
OBLONSKY I picked it up somewhere for Daria Alexandrovna and the children.
Matvey is ready with Oblonsky's shirt, which he puts over his master's head like a horse's collar.
There is a sloping lineup of five children, aged eight, five, four, three and two, dressed and brushed for presentation to their mother, Princess Daria Oblonsky, known as Dolly .
who we now see is heavily pregnant.
Stand- ing by is a French governess, Mlle.
Roland, and a Nurse.
Mlle.
Roland is buxom.
Dolly picks up the youngest, Vasya, to kiss him and hands him to the Nurse, and kisses the others in ascending order.
DOLLY Bonjour, Lili; bonjour, Masha; bonjour, Grisha; bonjour, Tanya.
DOLLY Who's coming to see Grandmama?
Oblonsky, dressed now and holding a cup of coffee, checks from the window.
Dolly, in furs, the four youngest children and the Nurse, who carries Vasya, all wrapped up against the cold weather, have come out of the house to a waiting sleigh, as noisy as starlings, bickering, competing, reprimanding.
The Oblonsky's Coachman assists, with a rug to spread across knees.
Oblonsky hands his coffee to Matvey and lights a small cigar.
He detours to take a sugared almond from a dish of sweets, and leaves the room .
Tanya is at her lessons with Mlle.
Roland.
When Oblonsky's face appears smiling round the door, Tanya jumps up and runs to him, greeting him, laughing, kissing his face, hanging on his neck.
OBLONSKY My Tanruchoshka!
OBLONSKY Mind my cigar.
He pops the sugared almond into her mouth and puts a conspiratorial finger to his lips.
Mlle.
Roland, who has stood up for him, clucks in reprimand.
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Be good today.
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) I'm off.
Tanya runs back to her seat and bends to her schoolbook.
Oblonsky looks Mlle.
Roland in the eye.
He moves his head slightly, unmistakably ask- ing her to come outside.
Mlle.
Roland moves her eyes at him in humorous reproach.
Clearly, this is familiar ground.
Oblonsky closes the door behind him.
mlle.
roland
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Read the chapter carefully.
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) I'll come back to test you on it .
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Read it twice.
CLOSE--Pretty fingers put on several rings, and then pick up a Faberge jade paper-knife to slit an envelope and withdraw a letter.
It is early in the day.
Anna's maid, Annushka, has been dressing Anna.
Annushka is young, loyal, modest.
Anna is at her dressing-table-bureau, which is host to at least two pho- tographs of a small boy (Serozha) and a child's unframed drawing of "Maman."
As she starts reading the letter, Anna's eyes frown.
Oblonsky and Mlle.
Roland in a passionate embrace, vertical, clothed.
Anna turns the page, reads on, concerned.
Still kissing, Oblonsky hoists up her skirts.
Anna turns to the second page.
Oblonsky, coming in quietly and late from a night on the town, enters his dressing room.
He stops.
He smiles a foolish apologetic smile.
Dolly is waiting for him, shocked, enraged, holding out a billet-doux on pink paper: a love note.
Anna speaks as in exasperation to a naughty child.
ANNA Tsk, oh .
ANNA Stiva!
ANNA and Dolly found a note from the governess.
Anna is speaking to her husband "confidentially."
Karenin, a busy man, drains his coffee cup and hands it (as with Oblonsky and Matvey) to his valet, Korney, who bows and withdraws.
Karenin continues transferring papers from his desk to his portfolio .
Which done, he nods to his private secretary, Mikhail Slyudin, who comes forward to receive it, bows and leaves.
KARENIN Well .
Karenin is twenty years older than Anna and a senior figure in govern- ment.
He has an unattractive reedy voice and is pleased with himself as a model of probity.
He has the habit of cracking his knuckles.
ANNA Stiva wants me to come to Moscow .
ANNA to persuade Dolly to forgive him.
KARENIN I'm to be deprived of my wife so that adul- tery may be forgiven?
KARENIN I can't excuse him just because he's your brother.
ANNA It's for Dolly's sake too.
KARENIN I have four committees today .
There is another interruption: Serozha, aged seven and a half, and his tutor, Vasily Lukich, enter for a ritual "good morning."
Serozha is a little frightened of his father, but the mother and son are in love.
Anna goes straight to Serozha, her heart lifted, to hug him.
KARENIN (CONT'D) Good, good!--I have the world waiting for me, there's never time to look at your exercises!
LUKICH Sergei Alexeyich is doing very well, Your Excellency.
ANNA Tsk-tsk, who put this shirt on you?
ANNA Never mind.
ANNA I'll come and hear you read.
KARENIN Tomorrow, perhaps.
KARENIN Thank you, Lukich-- perhaps tomorrow.
Lukich bows.
Anna goes with Serozha, relinquishing him finally.
She closes the door on them.
ANNA Alexei, do you think nine years of mar- riage and children should count for nothing against a .
ANNA an infatuation?
Karenin cracks his knuckles, concedes.
KARENIN No.
KARENIN Very well.
KARENIN But sin has a price, you may be sure of that.
Oblonsky has been bunking down on his couch.
He moans and groans.
He gets up and tries the door to the bedroom.
It's locked.
He knocks timidly.
OBLONSKY Dolly .
OBLONSKY please think of the children .
He listens hopefully.
The other door, leading to the upper landing, is opened violently by Dolly.
DOLLY You think of the children!
DOLLY Their lives are ruined now!
She slams the door behind her.
Oblonsky comes out of his dressing room to see the main bedroom door slammed.
He attempts to go in but the door is locked.
OBLONSKY Oh, Dolly .
OBLONSKY I beg you .
Matvey come to the top of the stairs with a telegram.
MATVEY Telegram.
MATVEY Should I send up the barber?
OBLONSKY No, just the razor.
Oblonsky tears open the telegram.
MATVEY Don't worry, sir, things will shape them- selves, you'll see.
OBLONSKY My sister Anna's coming tomorrow.
OBLONSKY We're saved.
Inner doors open and Oblonsky comes out of his private office.
He is his genial self.
Everyone in the general office-- minor officials, clerks-- stands up for him and bows.
Oblonsky is wearing government uniform--green coat with gold embroidery on the collar--instead of his own coat.
Oblonsky is helped out of one coat into the other.
DOORKEEPER Some man came without an appointment, Your Excellency .
DOORKEEPER waiting outside.
Oblonsky opens the door to look.
Levin is sitting waiting on a bench, wear- ing a sheepskin coat, cap and scuffed boots.
OBLONSKY Levin!
OBLONSKY Where did you disappear?
He seizes Levin and kisses him.
LEVIN I'm very anxious to see you.
LEVIN I need your advice.
OBLONSKY Well, then, come into my room.
Oblonsky leads Levin back through the general office, where everyone stands up again.
Levin's sheepskin and boots attract curious glances.
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) This is my oldest friend, Konstantin Dmit- rich Levin!
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Someone send word I'll be a few minutes late.
Oblonsky leads Levin inside and closes the door.
OBLONSKY I've been hard at it.
OBLONSKY Sit down.
Levin undoes his coat and sits down.
LEVIN Hard at what exactly?
OBLONSKY Why, we're overwhelmed with work!
LEVIN Oh--paperwork.
OBLONSKY Paperwork is the soul of Russia.
OBLONSKY Farming is only the stomach.
OBLONSKY When am I going to come and shoot some snipe?
Seeing the clothes Levin is wearing, he laughs.
Oh, but look at you, in Western clothes you told me you'd never wear again.
Some- thing's up.
Yes.
I'm in love.
I've come back to propose.
Have you guessed who she is?
I have a suspicion.
Why didn't you propose when you were here?
I decided it was impossible.
Kitty is of the heavens, an angel, and I am of the earth-- but then I thought and thought, and .
there's no life for me without her!
Do I have a chance?
Of course you do.
The Shcherbatskys are giving a soiree this evening.
Get there early before the crowd.
If I may suggest .
Anything!
What?
New boots.
Right.
Anything else?
OBLONSKY We'd better have dinner together.
OBLONSKY Come on, we'll meet later at l'Angleterre.
OBLONSKY Or do you prefer the Hermitage?
Oblonsky ushers Levin back into the general office.
Everyone stands up as before.
The Doorkeeper produces Oblonsky's top- coat and helps him into it.
OBLONSKY No--five-thirty at l'Angleterre--I owe them more than the Hermitage, so it wouldn't be fair to withdraw my custom.
OBLONSKY Boots, and a coat.
OBLONSKY And a proper hat.
He ushers Levin out.
Firstly, a Moscow street scene, busy with people going about their business, on foot and in conveyances.
Secondly, Levin approaches L'Angleterre in his new fur-collared coat, top hat and boots.
Oblonsky and Levin preside over the debris of three dozen oysters, with champagne in a bucket to hand.
Oblonsky is in a maudlin mood, afloat on champagne.
OBLONSKY It's so unfair.
OBLONSKY You marry for love, you're a good husband.
OBLONSKY Children arrive.
OBLONSKY Years depart.
OBLONSKY And all of a sudden your wife is tired, her hair is thin, her body .
OBLONSKY while you yourself still have your .
OBLONSKY vigour .
OBLONSKY and you find yourself distracted by a pretty woman .
LEVIN Forgive me, but I find that incomprehen- sible .
LEVIN As though I'd leave this restaurant and steal a roll from a baker's shop.
OBLONSKY Well, you know, a freshly baked roll .
LEVIN But I'm talking about love, and you're talk- ing about .
LEVIN your appetite.
OBLONSKY Easily confused.
OBLONSKY Now look, do you know Count Vronsky?
LEVIN Who?
LEVIN No.
LEVIN Why?
OBLONSKY He's your rival.
OBLONSKY He turned up from St.
OBLONSKY Petersburg after you left.
LEVIN Who is he?
OBLONSKY You don't have to worry about him.
OBLONSKY He's one of those rich, good-looking cavalry offi- cers who've got nothing to do but make love to pretty women .
A waiter arrives to remove the oyster shells, while an Elderly Waiter places a bowl of soup in front of Levin and a lobster in front of Oblonsky.
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Cabbage soup?
ELDERLY WAITER Potage aux choux a la Russe, as the gentle- man ordered.
LEVIN It's what I wanted.
Oblonsky laughs.
The Waiter departs.
LEVIN (CONT'D) Understand that for me, tonight is a ques- tion of life and death.
OBLONSKY Oh, Kostya!
OBLONSKY Kitty would be mad to refuse you.
OBLONSKY And Dolly is on your side, you know.
OBLONSKY She says her sister Kitty was always meant to be your wife and will be.
Levin jumps up in elation, collects himself, and sits.
LEVIN Dolly said that?
LEVIN I've always thought your Dolly's a gem.
OBLONSKY Oh, she is, she is .
OBLONSKY I loved her to distraction.
A little out of focus and further obscured by puffs of steam, the wheels of a locomotive and its tender plus a carriage or two, with part of the superstructure--the whole kit and caboodle turning out to be a rich child's table-top model railway--go by the Camera like a WIPE revealing the momentarily gigantic face of Anna .
who is crouching down to watch the toy go by.
Serozha is at present snivelling.
SEROZHA But why?
ANNA Because that's where Aunt Dolly lives.
SEROZHA But why?
ANNA I told you, Serozha.
ANNA She's not well.
ANNA I must go to see her.
SEROZHA But why?
ANNA Now, don't make Mama cry.
ANNA I'll be back before you know, and bring you a present.
SEROZHA Don't want a present.
SEROZHA I want you to stay.
Anna is on the brink of tears.
ANNA Oh .
ANNA my little Kutik .
SEROZHA What present?
ANNA That's better.
She dabs her eyes.
Kapitonich, the Karenins' Hall Porter, an "old soldier," comes out of the house to where a private carriage is waiting.
The coachman is Konrad.
Anna comes out with Annushka, who has a large soft bag containing everything her mistress needs for the journey.
Kapitonich holds the carriage door for them.
Anna has a window seat.
Next to her is Annushka.
In the opposite window seat is Countess Vronsky, at sixty losing the battle to keep her youthful beauty.
She has a lap dog (and perhaps a Faberge-topped walking cane).
Next to her is her Maid.
Anna is not happy to be leaving.
She holds a small framed photo of Sero- zha, which she then puts away in her red bag.
Countess Vronsky smiles at her.
Anna wipes her eyes, explains.
ANNA It's the first time I've left my little boy.
COUNTESS VRONSKY So you are leaving your son and I am return- ing to mine.
COUNTESS VRONSKY I am Countess Vronsky.
Anna knows the name.
countess vronsky (cont'd) I've been in St.
Petersburg for the christen- ing of a granddaughter--my elder son mar- ried Princess Chirkov.
You're a charming creature.
Why don't I know you?
ANNA I've never been in Moscow society, really.
COUNTESS VRONSKY But you know my name?
ANNA I've heard you mentioned .
COUNTESS VRONSKY Talked about, you mean.
COUNTESS VRONSKY Ah, love!
Anna, found out, smiles tentatively.
ANNA Was it love?
COUNTESS VRONSKY Always.
COUNTESS VRONSKY My sons are ashamed of me.
COUNTESS VRONSKY But I'd rather end up wishing I hadn't than end up wishing I had--wouldn't you?
ANNA I .
ANNA I don't know .
Anna looks at the snow on the window.
She is unsettled by the conversation.
A sleigh (i.e., a cab) brings Levin.
The Hall Porter lets Levin into the house.
A Footman takes Levin's hat and coat.
Levin is uneasy--he seems to be first to arrive.
He decides he has come too early.
He pulls his coat back from the Footman.
LEVIN I'll come back.
Princess Ekaterina (Kitty) Shcherbatsky is eighteen.
Eager to see who has arrived, she hurries from the direction of the reception room and looks down into the entrance hall in time to see Levin snatch his hat back from the Footman.
KITTY Konstantin!
LEVIN I'm too early.
KITTY No!
KITTY Come up!
Kitty runs off out of Levin's view.
He flings his hat and coat at the Foot- man and runs up the stairs.
Levin hurries in and finds Kitty seated prettily in a "receiving" pose.
She is alone.
KITTY Look at me!
KITTY I'm receiving for Papa and Maman who are late to dress.
KITTY It's my first reception.
Levin plays along, kissing her hand elaborately.
LEVIN Princess Ekaterina!
LEVIN Delighted, delighted!
KITTY I'm so pleased you were able to be with us, Konstantin Dmitrich!
LEVIN Kitty .
LEVIN you look .
LEVIN you look--
KITTY Stiva told us you were back.
KITTY How long are you staying?
LEVIN I don't know.
LEVIN It depends on you.
KITTY On me?
He has got ahead of himself.
Doors are flung open and the hosts, Prince and Princess Shcherbatsky, and a crowd of guests who have arrived together, are greeting each other.
Levin has to make a quick decision, and he makes the wrong one--to go on.
LEVIN What I mean to say--I came with only one purpose--I want to--will you be my wife?
Kitty panics.
A wave of Guests is almost upon her.
LEVIN (CONT'D) I'm sorry--sorry--wrong moment--but will you?
KITTY I can't.
KITTY I'm sorry.
Kitty flees.
Levin seems stunned, surrounded now by greetings, laughter, and servants with trays of drinks.
LEVIN Yes.
LEVIN It was impossible.
Prince and Princess Shcherbatsky receive a young married member of Kitty's set, Countess Nordston .
and introduce Levin, who hears and sees noth- ing.
He turns away, leaving the Countess hung out to dry.
Levin finds himself face to face with Burisov, a silky Officer in sky blue uniform, who introduces himself.
BURISOV Burisov.
BURISOV Are you the brother of Nikolai Levin?
LEVIN Yes.
BURISOV He's in Moscow, he's staying at the Unicorn in Khitrovka.
LEVIN How do you know?
BURISOV It's the sort of thing I know.
He bows to Levin and turns away to greet someone.
Levin reacts, decides to leave.
He makes for the door.
He nearly collides with someone, gives and receives an apology, and suddenly understands who this man in Guards uniform must be.
Levin turns.
LEVIN Count Vronsky?
VRONSKY Yes.
Levin pauses awkwardly.
Vronsky hesitates, bows and continues on.
Levin witnesses Kitty seeing Vronsky approaching, and sees her face light up.
Vronsky kisses her hand.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Princess Kitty .
VRONSKY (CONT'D) It's been so long, and yet it seems like yesterday.
His banter is lost on her.
She laughs happily.
KITTY It was yesterday!
Levin turns away and leaves.
Levin comes out of the grand house where several coaches are waiting.
Hum- bled and angry with himself and the world, he takes off his top hat and considers putting his fist through it, but jams it back on his head.
A horse- cab comes along.
Levin waves it down.
A mean street, an area of poverty and crime.
Levin pays off his cab.
Levin goes up a dimly lit, dingy staircase.
Snatches of MUSIC and SING- ING drift up the stairs.
Levin knocks at a door, then louder.
The door is flung open.
Nikolai Levin is the spirit of consumptive, bohemian radicalism.
He peers at Levin, surprised.
LEVIN It's Kostya.
Nikolai roars with laughter which turns to wheezing.
NIKOLAI God, look at him!
NIKOLAI You look like a capitalist!
NIKOLAI What do you want?
LEVIN Nothing.
LEVIN I came to see you.
Nikolai goes back into the room, shouting for "Masha."
Levin follows him.
Levin sees that he is in a tiny apartment.
A Young Woman looks at him fearfully from the inner doorway.
LEVIN Good evening, miss .
LEVIN madame .
NIKOLAI Don't talk to her like that.
NIKOLAI It frightens her.
NIKOLAI You sound like a magistrate.
NIKOLAI More vodka for my brother, quick about it.
LEVIN I don't want anything.
Masha goes to Nikolai and whispers to him, calming him.
NIKOLAI I'm all right.
He fills a wineglass with vodka and gulps it greedily.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) Who told you where to find me?
LEVIN A colonel in the Third Department.
LEVIN They're watching you.
NIKOLAI Good.
NIKOLAI They must think I'm dangerous.
Levin involuntarily smiles at the self-puffery.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) What have you got to smile about?
LEVIN Nothing.
NIKOLAI That's right.
NIKOLAI The day is coming.
NIKOLAI I gave up my birthright for it.
NIKOLAI You're on the wrong side of history.
NIKOLAI Not because privilege is immoral but because it's irrational.
Wheezing, he goes for the bottle again.
Masha tries to take it from him, appealing to Levin.
MASHA He is sick.
NIKOLAI Let go or I'll beat your lights out.
He pushes her away and pours himself more vodka.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) I took Mary Nikolova from a brothel but I consider her my wife.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) If her presence offends you you're free to leave.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) Are you married?
LEVIN No.
NIKOLAI Why not?
NIKOLAI Are you waiting to fall in love?
LEVIN No.
NIKOLAI Good.
NIKOLAI Romantic love will be the last illu- sion of the old order.
NIKOLAI You should marry one of your peasants.
Levin's reaction is almost violent, surprising Nikolai.
LEVIN Yes.
LEVIN I damn well should!
NIKOLAI The brotherhood of man.
Levin recovers himself.
He takes out his wallet.
LEVIN Nikolai, you have to see a doctor.
LEVIN Then come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe till you get your health back.
NIKOLAI With my wife?
Levin becomes flustered.
LEVIN If you .
LEVIN or go abroad to a spa.
LEVIN I'll send you more if that's what you .
Masha reaches for the money Levin has put on the table.
Nikolai knocks her hand away.
He throws the banknotes at Levin.
He coughs himself into a paroxysm.
Levin tries to embrace him.
Nikolai throws him off.
LEVIN (CONT'D) What about the brotherhood of brothers?
Masha snatches up the banknotes.
There is a scattering of people of all classes on the platform waiting for the arriving train.
By the entrance/exit gate, a Guards Officer stands holding a bouquet.
The Stationmaster stands by.
A strip of faded red carpet has been laid on the planks.
STATIONMASTER The private coach will stop opposite the carpet.
The Guards Officer nods.
He sees Vronsky arriving.
VRONSKY Hello, what's this?
GUARDS OFFICER Austrian royalty on their honeymoon.
GUARDS OFFICER I've got them for four days.
VRONSKY Bad luck.
VRONSKY What do they like?
VRONSKY Art?
GUARDS OFFICER Food.
VRONSKY Here's the train.
Vronsky moves closer to the slowing train, scanning the windows going by.
The Guards Officer and the Stationmaster are disconcerted to see the obvious "private coach" stop seriously short (or long) behind luggage wagons, etc.
STATIONMASTER I'll see to it.
He hurries away towards the engine.
Oblonsky hurries through, relieved not to be late.
Vronsky is saluted by his mother's Major Domo, a tall man in livery with a cockade.
MAJOR DOMO Second carriage, Your Excellency.
MAJOR DOMO I'll see to the Countess's luggage and bring it on to the house.
Vronsky nods, and makes his way towards the second coach, against the flow of disembarked passengers.
The Stationmaster speaks to the Engine Driver.
The Guards Officer with the bouquet stands uncertainly while arriving passengers go past him.
The Royal Austrian Honeymooners peer anxiously through the window.
Countess Vronsky remains sitting.
Annushka packs away Anna's blanket and pillow.
Anna looks out of the window.
ANNA I'll come back.
Anna moves to the door opening on to the "porch."
Vronsky is on the point of entering.
He steps back to allow her by.
They barely exchange a glance as she passes him, but, simultaneously, each of them looks back.
Anna looks away quickly.
His look lingers before he turns away to enter the carriage.
Anna, from her vantage point spots Oblonsky, calls to him.
Annushka, with her bag, comes onto the porch and descends to follow her mistress.
Anna steps down to the platform and embraces Oblonsky.
They are delighted to see each other.
ANNA You don't look ashamed.
OBLONSKY I am, I really am.
Countess Vronsky remains in her seat.
Vronsky bends at the window, look- ing at Oblonsky and Anna.
VRONSKY Yes, of course.
VRONSKY Oblonsky's sister .
VRONSKY Karenina.
COUNTESS Charmante, don't you think?
COUNTESS Wait for me in the carriage.
COUNTESS I'll take Tosca.
She takes the dog.
The Maid leaves with her bag.
VRONSKY You stayed longer in St.
VRONSKY Petersburg.
COUNTESS VRONSKY Long enough for you to start a little love affair, I hear.
VRONSKY I can't think what you're referring to, Maman.
He glances back to the window, where Anna turns back to enter the train.
As Anna turns back, a Railwayman with a hammer for tapping wheels is in her way.
He steps back for her with a bow and a "Madame!" Anna glances at him and moves past him.
The man taps a wheel, making a ring- ing sound which means the wheel is okay.
As Anna mounts the steps, a Train Guard looks up and down the plat- form, holding a green flag.
Anna enters from the porch.
ANNA There, Countess, you have found your son and I have found my brother.
COUNTESS VRONSKY Madame Karenin has a son, too.
COUNTESS VRONSKY It's the first time they have been apart, so she frets about him.
VRONSKY Excuse me for not recognizing you before.
COUNTESS VRONSKY We passed the time telling each other about our sons.
ANNA Yes, I've been hearing all about you.
VRONSKY That must have been very boring for you.
The ringing sound of the wheel-tapper's hammer is faintly audible in Anna's hesitation.
Anna shuts off the gallantry.
ANNA Au revoir, Countess.
COUNTESS VRONSKY Au revoir, my dear.
COUNTESS VRONSKY Let me kiss your pretty face.
Countess Vronsky does so.
Anna turns to offer her hand to Vronsky.
As Vronsky takes her hand, the train lurches and moves, unsteadying them both.
Oblonsky-- and everyone still on the platform--is shocked by a dreadful scream and shouting.
The train, having moved a few feet, stops.
Oblonsky hurries towards the scene of the accident, right opposite the gate.
The Station- master overtakes him.
The Wheel-Tapper lies between the wheels, mangled.
Oblonsky joins the horrified onlookers.
The Guards Officer arrives, too, with his bouquet.
Then Vronsky arrives.
He turns to the Guards Officer.
VRONSKY Keep your people inside until this has been cleared up.
Countess Vronsky, Vronsky, Anna and Oblonsky, Oblonsky almost in tears, come towards the gate.
A Porter follows with Anna's large suitcase, hat- boxes, etc.
Annushka has the travelling bag.
OBLONSKY the sole support of a large family, they say.
ANNA Can't anything be done for them?
Vronsky glances at her.
VRONSKY Wait for me, Maman.
Vronsky retraces his steps.
COUNTESS VRONSKY I've you to thank for that.
She knows her son.
Anna hasn't understood, but when Oblonsky looks back he sees Vronsky with the Stationmaster, taking money from his wallet.
OBLONSKY What a good fellow .
Anna catches on, doesn't like it.
ANNA Have you known Count Vronsky long?
OBLONSKY Did you like him?
OBLONSKY He's in love with Kitty.
ANNA Oh .
ANNA But we should be discussing you and Dolly.
She scolds him like a naughty boy.
ANNA (CONT'D) What have you got to say for yourself?
OBLONSKY I've said it all--on my knees--in tears .
OBLONSKY Now I need you to say it.
OBLONSKY I'm going to the office, so you'll have Dolly to yourself.
ANNA Don't be home late.
Dolly pours tea for Anna.
Dolly smiles at her wanly-- brightly.
DOLLY Kitty's coming by to see you.
DOLLY She's all grown-up, and a bit frightened of you--the belle of St.
DOLLY Petersburg society!
ANNA Is that who I am?
ANNA Dolly .
ANNA Stiva has told me.
Dolly bursts into tears.
Anna embraces her.
ANNA (CONT'D) Dolly, I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart.
I don't know what to do.
I know, I know.
I can't bear to be with him.
And he doesn't care, he's got what he wants.
What he wants is you.
He loves you, Dolly.
You and the children are everything to him.
Are we?
And there is room for a governess?
That was shameful, disgraceful.
But it was not love.
It was the animal in man, not the soul.
Stiva's remorse is from the soul.
What about me?
Does his remorse make it easier for me?--
I know you are suffering.
But, Dolly, you must tell me .
is there enough love left in your heart .
enough to forgive him?
When I think of them together, I can't for- give him, no!
ANNA My poor lamb.
ANNA So you'd rather accept your fate .
DOLLY My fate?
DOLLY But I haven't done anything!
DOLLY It's him
ANNA Do you love him, Dolly?
Dolly nods tearfully.
ANNA (CONT'D) You love him, and he loves you, but you can't forgive, so your lives must continue like this for ever, with both of you wretched.
She's winning.
Anna, Kitty, Tanya and Grisha are at a handsome card table where board games, dominoes, cards, etc., are kept.
There is a spill of alphabet bricks, each with a letter printed in it.
They are spelling out their names in alphabet bricks.
Grisha is on Anna's lap pulling at her hair.
The spelling business, including misspellings by Grisha, creates a noise of laughter and mock-rebuke.
Tanya at the same time is trying to pull a ring from Anna's finger.
Kitty is not at all frightened of Anna now; enraptured by her, laughing.
ANNA Grisha, don't pull so hard, you're getting it all in a tangle--and look for another G for
GRIGORI-- --here, darling, you can wear it till you go
Dolly sits apart, embroidering.
She looks up at the sound of voices down- stairs, Oblonsky coming home.
The children hear their father and abandon the card table, running out to greet him.
Dolly stands up to leave by a dif- ferent door, giving Anna a collusive glance.
Anna pushes aside the alphabet bricks.
ANNA (CONT'D) Well, that's the end of that.
KITTY Will you stay for the Bobrishchev's ball, Anna?
ANNA Oh .
ANNA I always feel dull at a ball.
KITTY How can you ever be dull?
Oblonsky arrives in the doorway with Tanya and Grisha hanging on him.
KITTY (CONT'D) Stiva!
KITTY (CONT'D) Tell Anna she must come to the ball.
OBLONSKY Of course she must.
He cocks an eye at Anna: how did it go with Dolly?
Anna moves her head: upstairs.
ANNA and God go with you.
Kitty catches the moment.
OBLONSKY You can introduce me to your new governess.
TANYA She's old!
TANYA She's a hundred!
Which leaves Anna and Kitty alone.
ANNA I know why you want me to come.
ANNA You want everyone to be there because you're sure it's going to be your night.
KITTY How did you know?
Anna's smile is her acting out a mock-mysteriousness.
ANNA I know everything.
She has moved alphabet letters around to spell out VRONSKY.
She laughs at Kitty's tearful, joyful nodding, genuinely happy for Kitty.
ANNA (CONT'D) Oh, to be your age again .
ANNA (CONT'D) surrounded by that blue mist, like mist on the mountains
44 that clears slowly to reveal the terrifying, beautiful valley you must enter to become grown-up .
44 I was eighteen too, when I got married .
A quiet note of regret hangs in the air between them for a moment before Anna dispels it.
With only a lamp or two lit, and the door open, Anna sits alone at the card table, with a neglected book, one hand playing idly with the alpha- bet bricks.
Their pleasant clicks are the only sound as she remains lost in thought.
She closes her book, marking the place.
She is going to go up to bed.
She hears the sound of the doorbell.
Vronsky has been let in spattered with snow.
SERVANT no, Your Excellency .
SERVANT He's just gone up.
SERVANT The Princess retired early .
SERVANT Is there a message?
Vronsky glances up and sees Anna looking down.
Their eyes meet.
A second passes.
Vronsky is about to speak.
Anna turns away and moves out of his view, towards further stairs, with her book.
VRONSKY No.
Levin is coming home in a sleigh, driven by his one-eyed coachman, Ignat.
He is huddled under a bearskin blanket.
The house is in sight.
The sleigh overtakes a Peasant Woman, Serafina, walking to the house car- rying a big bundle of willow wands strapped to her back: a strong young woman with a handsome face.
She stops and bows her head.
Levin looks at her.
She then looks him in the face.
Laska, barking joyfully, races from the house.
The bathhouse has a stove which heats water.
There is a brazier to create instant steam, but not now.
Levin, almost naked, lies on a plank deck, thoughtful, staring at something .
no, at someone: Serafina, who is put- ting on her clothes.
Postcoitum.
She has no angst.
Dressed, she crosses herself.
LEVIN Will you go to confession?
Serafina nods indifferently.
LEVIN (CONT'D) God will forgive you.
SERAFINA And you also, master.
SERAFINA He is watching.
LEVIN God forgive us then, for committing the act of love.
She nods without irony.
SERAFINA He is merciful.
LEVIN "Not according to my deserts, O Lord, but according to thy mercy"--that's a fine prayer.
LEVIN But I'm full of doubt.
LEVIN Sometimes I even doubt that God exists.
SERAFINA How can there be anything if God didn't make it?
LEVIN I don't know.
LEVIN One day science will tell us.
SERAFINA That's sinful talk if the priest heard you.
LEVIN Well, I won't go to confession.
SERAFINA Your father built the church.
SERAFINA You're con- fessed a while yet.
Levin feels outplayed.
SERAFINA (CONT'D) Will you bring me something from Moscow?
LEVIN What would you like?
SERAFINA Soap, the kind wrapped in paper to look pretty, and smelling like for a proper lady.
Levin is touched.
He nods.
Kitty enters the Ball, a proper lady.
This is a gilded affair, conducted by a Master of Ceremonies.
The Host and Hostess are positioned to welcome each guest.
Dancing has started-- a waltz.
Kitty and her parents enter the ballroom and are received by their hosts.
Everything has come together for Kitty--her dress, her hair, her skin, her moment.
She radiates happiness.
An Officer stands aside to let them pass, openly admiring Kitty, smoothing his moustache.
A Youth having trouble with his white tie hurries past but turns back to Kitty.
YOUTH Kitty!
YOUTH May I have a waltz?
KITTY You may, Boris.
KITTY I'll save you the third just because it's your first ball.
YOUTH You're my first conquest.
The Master of Ceremonies, Korsunsky, arrives and without permission sweeps her into the waltz.
KORSUNSKY It's a relaxation to dance with you, Princess.
Kitty sees Anna arriving with Oblonsky and gives a little gasp at her God-given beauty.
KORSUNSKY (CONT'D) But back to work!
KORSUNSKY (CONT'D) Where do you want to be taken?
KITTY There.
Korsunsky waltzes her brilliantly through the dancers and twirls her to rest in front of a small group including Anna and Oblonsky-- floating Kitty's train.
KORSUNSKY So that your ankles may be seen.
Anna appraises Kitty at a glance and gives her a tiny nod signifying top marks.
Kitty glows.
KITTY How are you, Stiva?
OBLONSKY Thanks to Anna, I am a happy man.
OBLONSKY Would you like to dance?
KITTY No, ask Anna.
ANNA No .
ANNA I don't .
She looks up and sees Vronsky coming straight towards her.
ANNA (CONT'D) Come on then.
Just as Vronsky is about to bow, she takes Oblonsky's arm and he whirls her away.
Kitty smiles for Vronsky but his eyes have followed Anna, know- ing she cut him.
He remembers himself after an awkward hiatus.
Kitty's mother and father are watching from afar.
Vronsky obliges.
He invites her into the waltz.
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY this vile, idiotic matchmaking of yours .
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY For goodness' sake, what have I done?
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY Levin is a thousand times better than this Petersburg fop.
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY If he had royal blood my daughter wouldn't need him!
Vronsky's mind is absent and the waltz ends after only a few steps.
He stand waiting for the music to start.
KITTY Is anything the matter?
VRONSKY No.
VRONSKY You look .
VRONSKY as lovely as ever, Princess Kitty.
The music starts and they dance on.
At the end of the waltz, Vronsky leaves Kitty with her mother, bows and departs.
Princess Shcherbatsky is beginning to have doubts.
She starts to ask.
KITTY Don't ask me, Maman!
Boris the Youth pops up to claim his dance.
Dancing, Kitty sees Vronsky talking to a couple of Officers.
She is anxious but not disillusioned.
Grumpy Prince Shcherbatsky is dancing with Countess Nordston.
COUNTESS NORDSTON He'll dance the mazurka with Kitty, you'll see.
COUNTESS NORDSTON I call the mazurka the now-or-never.
Anna watches the dancing.
She rejects an offer with a smile.
She sees Vron- sky and to her discomfort Vronsky looks up and catches her looking.
She turns away at once, and notices that ladies are curtseying and men are bowing as the Host and Hostess escort an overweight but glittering young couple towards a decorative buffet in an adjoining salon: the Austrian royal honeymooners .
attended by the Guards Officer from the station.
Anna stands and curtseys as they pass by into the salon .
where Oblonsky is roaring with laughter, champagne in hand.
AUSTRIAN PRINCESS we were shut up in the train for an hour!
Anna steals a sidelong glance towards Vronsky but he is no longer there.
She looks for him among the dancers, smiles at Kitty going by with the enthusiastic, inexpert Boris.
Suddenly, Vronsky is at Anna's side.
VRONSKY Dance with me.
ANNA I am not used to being spoken to like that by a man I met once at a railway station.
VRONSKY I dare say, but if I'm not to dance with you, I'm getting out of this operetta and going home.
ANNA Then, for Kitty's sake.
She gives him her hand.
Kitty looks for Vronsky, can't see him, then is taken aback to see him with Anna.
Kitty watches Anna dancing.
Anna says something which makes Vronsky laugh.
Anna laughs.
Anna blossoms in front of Kitty's eyes.
Vron- sky twirls Anna around and she comes smiling into his arms.
It goes on like that.
Kitty watches them from within the arms of young men, old men, from the wall.
Anna and Vronsky dance slow, they dance fast, gaily, solemnly, gazes locked.
Others are noticing too: Countess Nordston, Princess Shcherbatsky, and eagle-eyed matrons.
Anna, oblivious, has found a release in herself.
Countess Nordston finds Kitty sitting alone.
Korsunsky announces the Mazurka.
COUNTESS NORDSTON You're not dancing the mazurka?
COUNTESS NORDSTON I won't have it.
She pulls Kitty to her feet.
countess nordston (cont'd) I'm engaged by General Glub--I give him to you.
Korsunsky supervises a large circle of couples who change partners as they go round, with one couple dancing in the middle of the circle.
KORSUNSKY the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman .
The lady in the middle beckons to Anna and the man who, changing part- ners, happens to be dancing with her.
They enter the middle where they have their solo turn as a couple, while the original couple reenter the circum- ference.
Anna is flushed with pleasure.
Among the surrounding dancers, Vronsky has no eyes for his partner, only for Anna.
Kitty, dancing, watches Vronsky incredulous.
KORSUNSKY (CONT'D) and the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman .
Anna looks smilingly around the dancing circle and sees Kitty staring at her.
Anna "wakes up."
Everything which made her drunk makes her sober in the instant.
She waits until the change of partners brings Kitty and Vronsky together.
She beckons them into the middle.
Her own partner expects to re-join the circumference with Anna, but she makes an apology and escapes through the circle, running towards the door.
With a howl and clatter, the St.
Petersburg express seems to crash through the ballroom.
An abstract, nightmarish, discordant noise of clattering and howling accompanies unexplained flame--light on wood, glass, iron .
blackness opens like a door on a blizzard of light, and slams shut.
Anna's face, eyes closed, floats ghostlike.
Anna comes to consciousness in the dimly lit carriage, making sense of what seems like a hallucination.
Wind and snow batter on the window.
The Carriage Stoker, in long coat and cap, deals with the stove, clears frost off a thermometer on the wall.
He leaves, opening the door to snow and wind and slamming it behind him.
The train "speeds" (35 m.p.h.)
through a blizzard.
Anna has a reading lamp hooked over her armrest, and a novel.
She cuts a page with a paper-knife.
But the book cannot hold her.
She is reading without taking it in.
She turns back a page and tries again, but almost at once she turns to the window where the dark reflection of her face looks back at her.
Kitty's face staring as she stared at Anna, betrayed.
Anna turns away from the window.
The Guard comes through the door, letting in wind and snow, and shuts it.
He walks through the carriage.
GUARD Bologoye!
GUARD Fifteen minutes.
The train is slowing.
The train clanks to a halt at a small station.
Anna (and a few others) get down from the train.
She wears a heavy cloak.
The wind blows a few snowflakes through the station but the roof keeps off the snow.
She is glad of the fresh air.
Here and there, men are walking, smoking, laughing together.
She feels better.
A tall outline of a man in a greatcoat and military cap emerges from the flickering gloom.
She catches her breath.
He salutes her.
VRONSKY Can I be of service to you?
ANNA I didn't know you were .
ANNA Why are you leaving?
VRONSKY You know why.
VRONSKY I have to be where you are.
VRONSKY I can't not.
ANNA This is wrong.
ANNA If you're a good man, forget everything that happened, as I will.
VRONSKY I'll never forget a single thing about you, not a word, not a gesture--
ANNA That's enough!
She climbs the steps on to the porch.
At the door to the carriage she pauses.
The encounter has left her feeling elated and frightened.
The train arrives.
Vronsky gets down from the train and starts to walk towards Anna's carriage.
His German valet, Franz, runs up to him (from second class).
VRONSKY Take the luggage home.
Franz runs back the other way.
Vronsky walks on, then stops when he sees Karenin waiting on the platform, smiling and going forward to hand Anna down the steps.
Kapitonich enters the carriage.
Vronsky hesitates.
ANNA Is Serozha all right?
KARENIN Oh, is that all I get?
KARENIN Yes, he's quite well.
Vronsky steps forward.
Anna knows he's there.
She angles herself to avoid looking at him.
VRONSKY Did you have a good night?
He bows to Karenin.
ANNA Yes, quite comfortable.
ANNA Count Vronsky.
Karenin extends a hand indifferently then dismisses Vronsky, drawing Anna with him.
KARENIN I have to get back to the Committee .
He walks Anna away.
KARENIN (CONT'D) Well--were you a success?
ANNA I?
ANNA Oh--Dolly and Stiva .
ANNA yes, I think so .
Vronsky watches them go.
A snowy St.
Petersburg street.
Vronsky arrives home by cab.
He has a flat in an old apartment block.
Vronsky rings the doorbell.
A Servant opens the door.
A male voice shouts "If it's someone demanding money, don't let him in!"
VRONSKY I'll announce myself.
Veronsky enters the main room.
The occupant of the flat is a 2nd Lieuten- ant, Petritsky, wearing his greatcoat over shirt and trousers.
PETRITSKY Vronsky!
PETRITSKY The master himself.
PETRITSKY Baroness, coffee from the new coffeepot for Count Vronsky.
Petritsky indicates a pretty young woman in satin.
PETRITSKY (CONT'D) I hope you are pleased by this ornament to your quarters.
Vronsky bows and kisses her fingers.
BARONESS I'll be off home if I'm in the way.
You're at home where you are, Baroness.
Ah!--Pierre, you never say such pretty things to me.
We were just discussing my husband.
He won't divorce me, you see.
And do you know why?
No.
Because he likes eating off my family silver.
Ah.
I want to bring an action.
Just because I'm supposed to be unfaithful, I don't see why I have to eat off Pierre's crockery.
Look at it.
It's my crockery.
How was Moscow?
Provincial.
Anna, her dress changed, lies on Serozha's bed, on her side, one arm under his bedclothes scratching his back gently.
He lies quietly on his stomach, with his eyes closed, his face inches from hers.
In the dim light of a night- light she gazes at him for long moments.
SEROZHA You've stopped.
She resumes scratching.
He grunts contentedly.
SEROZHA (CONT'D) Thank you for my present.
ANNA Sssh .
She kisses him and continues to lie there, gently scratching.
He falls quickly asleep.
She removes her arm and restores his bedclothes.
There is a suite of rooms: the Bedroom connects to Anna's Boudoir/Dressing Room; and thence to Karenin's small Sitting Room/Dressing Room, which connects to the rest of the house.
The rooms--like the whole house-- are lit by gas lamps but also by candles at key points.
Korney, the Valet, gathers up a discarded shirt, etc.
Karenin in a dressing gown is reading in a comfortable chair, by a candle lamp.
Korney leaves.
Anna is at her bureau.
She frowns and tears up the letter she is writing.
Karenin looks at the clock-- nearly midnight-- and closes his book.
He blows out the candle.
He comes to the boudoir announcing himself with a smile.
KARENIN Time for bed!
Karenin comes to put his hand on Anna's shoulder.
ANNA I'm writing to Dolly .
ANNA and to Kitty.
KARENIN You are .
KARENIN good.
Anna shakes her head and clasps his hand.
Candles each side of the bed.
Karenin cracks his knuckles.
He unlocks a drawer and opens a tin box lying in the drawer.
Anna, disrobing, registers these sounds.
KARENIN What are they saying in Moscow about the new Statute?
ANNA What new Statute?
Karenin takes a contraceptive sheath, made from animal intestine (re- usable) from the tin.
KARENIN The new Statute I carried in Council.
Anna blows her candle out and gets into bed.
ANNA No one mentioned it.
KARENIN Ah.
KARENIN Really?
He comes to bed in his nightshirt.
KARENIN (CONT'D) Here it made quite a sensation.
He gets into bed.
Anna waits dead-eyed.
Karenin blows his candle out.
Kitty, a hollow-eyed version of herself, in a demure nightdress, sits upright on a chaise longue with her legs stretched out.
The Family Doctor deferen- tially removes one of her slippers as though it were an intimate garment.
FAMILY DOCTOR Forgive me, Princess, but I must .
With a silver "fork" the Doctor tests the sole of her foot for a reflex.
Kitty is miserably going along with a farce she despises.
The Prince and Princess are hovering.
The Princess flutters with anxiety, the Prince is in a temper.
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY Am I the only one who knows what's wrong with her?
But a Celebrity Doctor, as shiny as his own gold watch which he is check- ing, is bearing down on them, riding over a Footman's attempt to announce him.
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY Oh, thank God, doctor--my friends say you're the only one who can save her!
CELEBRITY DOCTOR Possibly, Princess, possibly!
CELEBRITY DOCTOR At your service, Your Excellencies.
CELEBRITY DOCTOR Where is the patient?
Kitty is sobbing with shame: the Celebrity Doctor has stripped her to the waist and is tapping her chest.
The Family Doctor can't bear it and excuses himself.
CELEBRITY DOCTOR Come, come, Princess, we are not backward people--I handle naked bodies every day.
CELEBRITY DOCTOR Deep breath now .
The Family Doctor and the parents are in a huddle.
The Prince is apoplectic.
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY By God.
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY I'll challenge the scoundrel!
FAMILY DOCTOR It's the modern way .
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY You're not a doctor!
FAMILY DOCTOR Her symptoms .
FAMILY DOCTOR loss of appetite, fast
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY Well, whose pulse wouldn't be fast if some brute of a--
The Celebrity Doctor comes briskly out of Kitty's room, checking his watch.
CELEBRITY DOCTOR Nervous palpitations.
CELEBRITY DOCTOR We must treat the nerves.
CELEBRITY DOCTOR A tubercular cavity is suspected, too soon to tell.
CELEBRITY DOCTOR Soden water every two hours.
CELEBRITY DOCTOR I must see her again tomorrow.
CELEBRITY DOCTOR Prince!
CELEBRITY DOCTOR Princess!
He's gone.
The Prince enters Kitty's room.
Kitty is humiliated and triple-wrapped against the violation of her bosom.
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY Don't you fret, my little Kate!
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY You'll wake up one fine morning and say to yourself--"I feel well and happy and I'll go out for a walk with Papa!"
The Prince is mortified when Kitty's sobs redouble.
The social set Anna now moves in is the brilliant circle with connections to the Court on one hand and to the demi-monde of artists on the other.
A leading light of this set is Princess Betsy Tverskaya, a rich society beauty.
Betsy's immediate circle includes Tuskevich, her "admirer."
Anna lifts her eyes to see Vronsky in front of her, talking to Betsy.
Vronsky sees Anna and bows.
She acknowledges him and kisses Betsy, and moves on, studying the next picture.
Vronsky watches Anna move on.
Betsy cocks an eye at him.
A few rows of chairs in someone's reception room, a mixed audience of guests, a flashy pianist .
Betsy with a "toy" dog on her lap, Tuskevich on one side, Anna on the other.
The dog yaps and sneezes.
Betsy hands the dog to Tuskevich, who goes to exit with the dog.
As Tuskevich leaves, Vronsky comes in.
Anna sees him.
She turns back to the piano.
Betsy glances at her.
Anna and Betsy, on a bright snow-white day, are being driven through a park in Betsy's smart equipage .
towards a horseman walking towards them: Vronsky salutes the little carriage as it trots by him.
Anna keeps looking straight ahead.
Betsy acknowledges Vronsky's salute.
BETSY I want to give a small dinner before the opera.
BETSY Is there anyone you would like me to ask?
ANNA Yes .
ANNA Yes, the Metropolitan Bishop of St.
ANNA Petersburg.
Betsy laughs.
Annushka puts Anna's opera cloak over her shoulders, while Korney stands ready with Karenin's cloak and opera hat.
Karenin comes down the stairs to join Anna.
Kapitonich stands ready to let them out.
KARENIN Countess Lydia tells me you haven't been to one of her evenings since you returned.
ANNA The last one was to meet a missionary, the one before was for a lecture on the union of the Greek and Roman churches.
ANNA I'm sorry--I know you're fond of her.
ANNA Come on, or we'll be late.
Kapitonich opens the door to let them out.
This is a small theatre with a "promenade" area where a group of Guards Officers of high and low rank mix together to enjoy the chanteuses, the comedians and the can-can girls.
Vronsky is with his Commanding Officer, Colonel Demin.
DEMIN Here's the thing, Vronsky.
DEMIN A posting has come up and there's a promotion in it for you.
VRONSKY Thank you, sir.
DEMIN The garrison in Tashkent.
VRONSKY Tashkent?
VRONSKY But .
VRONSKY I would like to stay in Peter, sir, if you don't mind.
DEMIN I don't mind.
DEMIN But your mother .
The can-can music starts up, to many cheers.
Demin claps enthusiastically.
Vronsky is angry.
An attendant takes Vronsky's coat and gives him a token for it.
There is a performance going on within, resolving into applause as he mounts the stairs.
Karenin, an escapee looking at his pocket watch, comes down the stairs, goes down past Vronsky, looks back at him for a moment, and continues.
Vronsky enters the box as the performance prepares to resume.
It is the Tverskoy box, occupied by Princess Betsy and her husband, who is likeable, overweight and, strangely enough, looking at an antiquarian book; wear- ing white gloves.
Vronsky bows to them and sits down next to Betsy.
He takes her opera glasses and looks through them at the Karenin box.
BETSY You didn't come to my dinner.
VRONSKY I had to see my Commanding Officer.
BETSY "She" didn't come either.
Vronsky watches Anna through the glasses.
Countess Lydia Ivanovna is next to her.
Lydia is in her forties, sallow, no beauty, sincerely religious, and determined.
LYDIA work never ceases for great men.
LYDIA Your husband is a saint and we must all cherish him for Russia's sake.
Anna winces a smile.
LYDIA (CONT'D) I hope you can come on afterwards--Father Kristof's report on the Chinese mission will be with lantern slides.
ANNA I'm expected at the Tverskoys.
LYDIA No doubt, but I'm sure Princess Betsy can wait for you, my dear.
Anna glances at Betsy's box and sees Vronsky there.
The opera resumes.
ANNA Yes.
ANNA In fact, I think I won't go to Betsy's.
Vronsky looks through Betsy's glasses.
BETSY You're caught.
VRONSKY I'm afraid I am becoming ridiculous.
Discreet Footmen move chairs to accommodate the guests who move to join one of the conversation circles that make a buzz in the room.
Betsy sits by the samovar with her little court, including Tuskevich.
The Guests include the Princess Myagkaya, stout, red-faced, outspoken, and two Society ladies, Lisa Merkalova and "Anna's Friend."
Vronsky arrives.
LISA MERKALOVA Now, there's a phenomenon, look-- Anna's shadow has arrived before Anna!
ANNA'S FRIEND I'm Anna's friend .
ANNA'S FRIEND but this making-up- one's-mind-to-it in public is not polite to a distinguished man like Karenin.
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA In my opinion Karenin is a fool, and Anna is the best of us.
LISA MERKALOVA And we all love you for your contrary opin- ions, Princess.
Vronsky looks around.
He knows everybody in the room.
BETSY Alexei .
BETSY You look desperate.
BETSY That's not attractive.
VRONSKY I'm losing hope.
BETSY Hope of what?
BETSY Persuading a virtuous woman to break her marriage vows?
VRONSKY And how is Tuskevich?
BETSY That's not attractive either.
BETSY Besides, I was never virtuous.
VRONSKY No--you're right.
VRONSKY She won't come.
VRONSKY I'm going home.
The Karenin coach arrives.
It's Anna arriving at Betsy's.
She enters the house in almost unseemly haste.
Several coaches are waiting.
Vronsky, in a state, lets himself be carried along.
Then he changes his mind.
He puts his head out of the window to shout to the Coachman.
VRONSKY Turn round!
Anna enters.
Faces turn to her.
She glances around.
She knows at once that Vronsky isn't there.
Betsy beckons to her across the room.
Anna, self- possessed, smiling, nodding to friends, pressing a hand held out to her, offering the other hand to be kissed, glides through a crowd of Betsy's guests.
VOICES Wasn't Nilsson glorious?
VOICES One sees that she has studied Kaulbach, of course .
VOICES There's something Louis Quinze about Tuskevich .
VOICES as if he came with the furniture .
Betsy is smoking elegantly.
She kisses Anna.
BETSY He's gone.
BETSY But you're just in time for the surprise.
There is a series of minor explosions outside and the darkness out there turns into an illuminated garden lit by fountains of fire, sprays of light.
The guests react with cries of pleasure and applause.
Anna turns at once to the window near her, puts her face up against the glass, putting her hands to her temples as if to see the illuminations better.
Her self-possessed face, lit by fireworks, falls apart in misery.
The firework display continues for a short minute and is applauded.
Betsy acknowledges the congratulations and sycophancy which are her due.
Foot- men come through the room with trays of ices.
Anna is still at the window, unaware that there is only darkness outside.
In the room, Betsy notes the oddity: Anna alone with her back to the room.
Anna opens her eyes.
She is lost for a moment, perplexed.
vronsky (O.C.)
May I have the honour of bringing you an ice?
Anna turns, understanding nothing.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Ices are being served.
ANNA I would prefer to try a cigarette.
She sits down.
Vronsky takes out a cigarette case.
He lights her cigarette.
She tries it and coughs.
VRONSKY Courage!
Anna smiles.
Puffs delicately once.
ANNA Thank you.
She gives the cigarette to him.
ANNA (CONT'D) I'll try another one sometime.
VRONSKY When?
She looks at him in surprise.
He dunks the cigarette in an abandoned dish of ice cream.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Where?
ANNA Just as I was thinking your manners have improved since Moscow.
ANNA You behaved badly, very badly.
VRONSKY And who was responsible for that?
Anna gets up and walks over to Betsy's chair.
ANNA Give me a cup of tea.
Betsy obediently gets up to fill a cup from the samovar.
Vronsky follows Anna.
This is watched by more than one guest.
Betsy hands the cup to Anna.
BETSY How nice--Alexei Aleksandrevich has arrived.
Karenin enters smiling.
Lisa Merkalova and Anna's Friend share a delicious-malicious moment.
LISA MERKALOVA I'm not sure my nerves can stand another Alexei at this moment.
As Betsy and Karenin move smilingly to greet each other, Karenin's radar picks up the two women's intimate laughter.
Karenin remains at apparent ease, as though unaware of people's glances at Vronsky and Anna, and he kisses Betsy's hand.
Princess Myagkaya has meanwhile gone over to Anna.
Anna likes her and is glad of the diversion.
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner.
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA The sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou- bles, and it was ghastly.
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA We had to ask them back.
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA I gave them a sauce that cost eighty- five kopeks and it was a triumph.
Anna and Vronsky laugh.
Princess Myagkaya moves on.
VRONSKY Were you glad to see me or not?
ANNA This must stop.
ANNA You make me feel as if I were guilty of something.
VRONSKY What do you want me to do?
ANNA I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty to forgive you.
VRONSKY No, that's not what you want.
VRONSKY Moscow?
VRONSKY I can do better than that.
VRONSKY Tonight I refused a posting to Tashkent.
VRONSKY I can change my mind, and you'll never see me again.
ANNA If you have any thought for me, you will give me back my peace.
VRONSKY I have no peace to give.
VRONSKY There can be no peace for us--only misery or the greatest happiness.
VRONSKY You are my whole life now.
She looks at him and nods slowly, as if in thought.
Betsy diplomatically leads Karenin to Anna.
BETSY Your husband is impossible!-- his opinions are all wrong but he talks so brilliantly he wins every argument.
Anna looks up at her, hearing nothing.
ANNA What?
She notices Karenin, who kisses her hand.
Vronsky acknowledges Karenin.
KARENIN I called to take you home.
ANNA No, I'm staying.
ANNA Send the carriage back for me.
KARENIN Of course.
He bows to Betsy.
Ignoring Vronsky, he turns away.
Vronsky is with one group of guests, Anna with another.
She is animated, excited, at a small table, involved in a game of cards-- which she wins, to local applause.
She speaks a "must go" to Betsy, and swiftly goes to the door.
Dressed for outdoors, Anna comes down the staircase.
The Doorkeeper sees her, opens the door and signals.
The Karenin coach moves to the entrance door, which is held open by the Doorkeeper.
Anna hears hurried footsteps on the stairs.
She hesitates.
She continues towards the door.
Vronsky catches up with her.
The Doorkeeper holds the door open.
VRONSKY Do you want me to go to Tashkent?
The two horses are restless in the freezing air.
Konrad looks to the open door.
Nobody coming.
VRONSKY So I'll go to Tashkent.
ANNA No.
ANNA I don't want you to go.
She turns and goes out.
Vronsky follows her.
Vronsky opens the carriage door for her.
She gets into the coach, he closes the door.
He watches the coach go.
His face.
Her face.
Kapitonich lets Anna in.
Karenin, reading by candlelight in his dressing gown, hears the sounds of Anna's return, all the way to her entrance.
He cracks his knuckles.
ANNA Waiting up?
ANNA How unlike you!
KARENIN Yes, I stayed up to talk to you.
Anna keeps going, to her dressing room/boudoir.
ANNA What about?
ANNA It's late.
ANNA Where's Annushka?
He waits for her to return without her cloak.
KARENIN I sent her off.
ANNA Well, if you want to talk, but we should go to bed.
I have to warn you about something.
Warn me?
It's really rather late .
I wish to warn you that you may inadver- tently, by indiscretion and carelessness, give the world occasion to talk about you.
I am not a committee.
Please say what you want to tell me.
You and Count Vronsky attracted attention tonight.
You don't like it when I don't talk to people, and you don't like it when I do.
I didn't notice anything, myself.
But I saw that everyone else noticed.
I consider jeal- ousy to be insulting to you and degrading to me.
I have no right to inquire into your feelings.
They concern only your conscience.
But I'm your husband and I love you.
It's my duty to remind you that we are bound together by God, and this bond can only be broken by a crime against God.
ANNA I have nothing to say to you, and I'm tired.
KARENIN And you have a son.
She returns to the boudoir.
After a moment he follows.
Karenin finds her in her underwear, throwing aside her dress.
He apolo- gises for that.
KARENIN Forgive me.
KARENIN If I am wrong, I ask your pardon.
ANNA I don't know what you're talking about, and it's really too late for this.
ANNA Excuse me, please.
Because she wants to undress, Karenin leaves her.
Anna lies in bed next to Karenin, elated.
ANNA Too late.
In the next instant, seemingly in her own bed, she gasps and jerks as though her body has taken a blow.
The CUTS are now between a fragmented narrative of voracious sex ("SEX AS BEFORE") and "prelude to sex," this being a sequence of shots starting with:--
Anna arrives, heavily veiled, by cab.
She enters the building.
Vronsky opens his door to Anna.
They don't speak.
He takes her hand and brings her in.
Vronsky leads Anna through the apartment to the bedroom.
Vronsky takes off Anna's outer clothes, slowly and carefully, starting with her hat and veil.
Anna, in underclothes, unbuttons Vronsky's shirt.
Anna and Vronsky are standing kissing passionately.
He has no shirt.
Anna ends up half off the edge of Vronsky's bed, climaxing upside down and falling to the floor.
Vronsky, also half off the bed, looks down at her.
He reaches down for her.
She grasps hold of his hand, huddled, hugs it to her, distressed to tears.
ANNA Oh God forgive me.
ANNA It's the end of everything--I've got nothing left now, only you.
ANNA Remember that.
VRONSKY Anna .
VRONSKY Anna .
VRONSKY how can I not remem- ber?
VRONSKY You're my happiness.
He draws her back on to the bed, kisses her face, her shoulder .
ANNA Happiness!
ANNA You murdered my happiness.
She tries to leave but he attacks her as a lover, and she gives way, responding.
ANNA (CONT'D) Murderer.
ANNA (CONT'D) Murderer.
ANNA (CONT'D) Go on.
ANNA (CONT'D) Go on.
ANNA (CONT'D) Go on.
She starts hitting him.
ANNA (CONT'D) Yes.
ANNA (CONT'D) Go on.
ANNA (CONT'D) Go on.
ANNA (CONT'D) Go on.
In sunshine, a large chunk of ice loses its purchase on winter and goes floating along a stream of tiny ice floes between grassy banks almost free of snow, with early aconites showing.
The icy stream flows under a footbridge which has a broken handrail.
Vasili, the steward, is on the bridge with a Carpenter.
Levin, on horseback, is displeased.
LEVIN I thought that had been done.
VASILI I gave the order.
VASILI What can you do with these people?
Levin rides on, into an expanded prospect of fields and woods, snow on the ground.
When Levin gets in view of the house, he is puzzled by the distant sight of a three-horse sledge arriving.
The new arrival is Oblonsky, enjoying his food.
OBLONSKY Ah--potage aux choux a la Russe!
Agafia comes in with the roast fowl.
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Agafia!--if you opened up in Moscow, l'Angleterre would go out of business.
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Do you want news of Moscow?
LEVIN Of Babylon?
LEVIN No.
OBLONSKY You're right, what do you care?
OBLONSKY You love the country--you've got it.
OBLONSKY You love agricultur- ing, and, Lord knows, you've got it.
OBLONSKY You love shooting--you've got it.
OBLONSKY You've got every- thing you want!
Agafia, leaving, throws Levin a look (no wife).
LEVIN All right, go on, then.
LEVIN Have you stopped stealing bread rolls?
OBLONSKY Ballet girl, oriental type.
OBLONSKY How can I help it?
LEVIN So, nothing new to tell me.
LEVIN How is--how are the Shcherbatskys?
OBLONSKY You mean Kitty.
LEVIN I .
LEVIN Is she engaged now?
OBLONSKY No.
OBLONSKY Vronsky went back to St.
OBLONSKY Petersburg.
He waits for this to sink in.
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Kitty will be at Ergoshovo visiting Dolly in the summer.
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) You could .
LEVIN Oh yes, as if I had time in the summer!
LEVIN And I've got extra land this year at Kashin for the haymaking.
OBLONSKY Kashin?
OBLONSKY That's on the Ergoshovo road, isn't it?
OBLONSKY Won't you call when Kitty is there?
LEVIN Especially not then.
LEVIN I humiliated myself once.
Now it's a row.
OBLONSKY Damn you, Kostya, you love Kitty and you can't forgive her because, first, you funked it, then you bungled it, then you ran away from an eighteen-year-old girl who was made a fool of by a uniform.
OBLONSKY It's Kitty I'm sorry for--not you!
LEVIN Her heart told her no.
LEVIN Did you come to shoot snipe or criticize me?
Levin and Oblonsky, with Laska, wait with their guns, a few yards apart.
Levin has calmed down.
LEVIN For you, getting married is .
LEVIN a social engage- ment.
LEVIN Not for me.
LEVIN For me, it's the condition of personal happiness and living the right way.
LEVIN I'll never again be carried away by passion.
LEVIN I renounce it.
LEVIN I'll have to find another way .
OBLONSKY Look out--here they come!
A couple of snipe come drumming over the trees.
The men fire simultane- ously.
One snipe falls.
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Bad luck!
Oblonsky laughs.
Despite himself, Levin laughs too.
Laska retrieves the bird.
Dolly has had her baby.
She is holding the infant, having just finished feeding him.
Kitty is with her.
DOLLY There.
DOLLY Oh, I'm sore with his feeding!
DOLLY Would you like to hold him?
Dolly gives the baby to Kitty, who takes him almost unwillingly.
Dolly buttons herself.
Kitty's maternal instinct won't engage.
Dolly notes it.
DOLLY (CONT'D) Well, don't hold him like a parcel .
DOLLY (CONT'D) It's Aunt Kitty, darling.
DOLLY (CONT'D) Little face .
DOLLY (CONT'D) little fingers .
DOLLY (CONT'D) look at you .
DOLLY (CONT'D) Doesn't he make you ashamed of dwelling on your troubles .
KITTY I have no troubles.
DOLLY That man wasn't worth the tears, believe me.
KITTY I don't care about him.
KITTY I don't even think about him.
KITTY Or her.
KITTY Except to hate her.
DOLLY Then we'll never speak of it again.
Dolly relieves Kitty of the baby.
DOLLY (CONT'D) There are better men waiting for you.
DOLLY (CONT'D) Stiva says .
DOLLY (CONT'D) Kitty, my lamb, did Konstantin Levin .
KITTY What has Levin got to do with it?
KITTY Anyway, I'll never get married.
KITTY The whole business of .
KITTY it's become disgusting to me .
KITTY and look what it's done for you!
KITTY Why do they call it love?
DOLLY Because it's love.
Lovingly, she settles the baby in his crib, her face filled with tender joy at the bargain.
A lovers' idyll, by a stream on a warm day.
Anna, lightly dressed, smoking a cigarette, watches Vronsky fill his wineglass from a tethered bottle in the stream.
There is a pony trap which brought them.
He comes back to sit by her.
She kisses him.
ANNA I want you to.
ANNA I don't care about it.
VRONSKY You should care.
VRONSKY You're not supposed to.
ANNA Pooh!
ANNA Who says?
VRONSKY Everybody.
VRONSKY Doctors.
She laughs and throws her cigarette into the stream.
ANNA You're squeamish.
ANNA You a soldier!
ANNA Would you faint?
VRONSKY Anyway, someone might be watching.
Anna looks all around.
Vast emptiness.
She lifts a dock leaf to look under it.
She looks up at the sky.
ANNA But I'm damned anyway.
VRONSKY I'm not.
VRONSKY I'm blessed.
Anna pushes him onto his back and straddles him.
ANNA You love me.
VRONSKY Yes.
ANNA Only me.
VRONSKY No.
ANNA Apart from Frou-Frou.
VRONSKY Yes.
Anna holds his face between her hands and works her body on him.
ANNA But me more than your horse?
VRONSKY Yes.
ANNA Are you happy?
VRONSKY Yes.
ANNA And you love me?
VRONSKY Yes.
ANNA How much?
VRONSKY This much.
Anna drags the front of her skirts out of her way.
ANNA This much?
VRONSKY Yes.
ANNA This much?
VRONSKY Yes.
ANNA This much?
VRONSKY Yes.
ANNA This much?
ANNA And this much?
ANNA And this much?
VRONSKY Yes.
ANNA And .
ANNA this .
ANNA much .
She falls on him.
He strokes her hair.
Her hand comes into view, the index finger bloody.
She carefully paints his lips with it.
She kisses his lips clean, and rolls off him onto her back.
ANNA (CONT'D) So this is love.
ANNA (CONT'D) This.
Korney brings Countess Lydia.
Karenin comes from behind his desk to invite her to a chair.
KARENIN Countess .
KARENIN I thought you would be at Peterhof now.
LYDIA I've come from there.
LYDIA I'm distressed that you haven't taken your usual house this year.
KARENIN Anna wanted a change.
KARENIN She is spending the summer at Tsarskoe.
LYDIA Near Princess Betsy.
LYDIA And .
Karenin waits.
LYDIA (CONT'D) The Guards are in summer camp at Tsarskoe.
Karenin waits.
LYDIA (CONT'D) Alexei Alexandrovich, forgive me but you are too tolerant!
LYDIA (CONT'D) Your wife .
Karenin affects surprise.
KARENIN Oh, is this about my wife?
He smiles at her.
KARENIN (CONT'D) My wife is beyond reproach.
KARENIN (CONT'D) She is, after all, my wife.
Countess Lydia gets the message.
She rises to go.
Karenin kisses her hand and accompanies her to the door.
She leaves him, and his social mask gives way to his disturbance.
The Commanding Officer is throwing a party for his officers: serious drink- ing, Soldier Servants, a crowded table on the large verandah, Soldier Sing- ers in white linen tunics performing operetta and folk songs.
Vronsky, in party spirit, is with Petritsky and another friend, Yashvin, singing along.
An officer we don't know is, surprisingly, hailed as "Vronsky!"--he's Vronsky's elder brother, Alexander.
He gestures "Later!" and goes to Vron- sky.
The brothers embrace.
ALEXANDER Alyosha .
ALEXANDER a message from Maman.
ALEXANDER Her friend Princess Sorokina has a house here, and a virgin daughter, that's not part of the
94 message, but they'll all be at the races and you're expected to supper afterwards.
The song ends and Demin, half drunk, climbs on the table, shouts for silence and a toast.
DEMIN Gentlemen--I give you--the regiment!
General uproar.
"The regiment."
On a garden bench where the noise of the party is quieter, Vronsky and Alexander talk.
ALEXANDER I heard you turned down a promotion.
VRONSKY That was Maman interfering.
ALEXANDER Yes.
ALEXANDER And now she's come up with a princess for you.
ALEXANDER Alexei--we're brothers, so don't take offence.
ALEXANDER Getting married puts the pack on your back--it leaves your hands free for climbing the ladder.
ALEXANDER Getting serious about a married woman is like carrying your pack in your arms.
VRONSKY So they talk about me.
VRONSKY I'm leaving, Sasha.
ALEXANDER An assignation?
VRONSKY Come on, I'll introduce you.
Vronsky with Alexander beside him clucks his tongue at the black opening of a stable and calls softly for Frou-Frou.
There's a stir within and the mare's head appears.
Vronsky opens the door.
ALEXANDER Beautiful.
ALEXANDER A man would come to no harm.
ALEXANDER Do you think you'll win tomorrow?
VRONSKY Makhotin's Gladiator is favourite, sixteen hands--Frou-Frou looks dainty beside him, but she's got heart.
VRONSKY Haven't you, my darling?
He kisses Frou-Frou.
Vronsky sees Anna before she sees him.
He pauses to look at her, struck by her beauty, full of love for her.
She is lost in thought.
VRONSKY Anna.
She has not been expecting him.
She is concerned.
ANNA Alexei, what is it?
He shakes his head: nothing.
She comes to him and hides her face in his breast.
He holds her tight, taking her hand and kissing it.
VRONSKY I couldn't bear not to see you before the race.
She hugs him, kissing his tunic.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) What were you thinking about?
She continues to hide her face.
He lifts her face.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Tell me.
ANNA I'm pregnant.
Vronsky presses her hand to his face.
VRONSKY Ah .
VRONSKY My love.
He kisses her brow and her eyes.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Well, love was never a game to us.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Here's an end to living in corners, existing day to day on lies.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Yes, now we can be together.
ANNA How can we, Alexei?
VRONSKY Tell Karenin everything.
ANNA Do you think my husband will make you a present of me?
VRONSKY Leave him.
ANNA Leave him and be your mistress?
VRONSKY Yes.
VRONSKY Run away.
ANNA I would never see my son again.
ANNA The laws are made by husbands and fathers.
VRONSKY What, then?
VRONSKY I'll never forgive myself for your unhappiness.
Anna looks into his face.
ANNA Unhappiness?
ANNA I'm like a starving beggar who has been given food.
She smiles rapturously.
ANNA (CONT'D) I unhappy?
ANNA (CONT'D) No, this is my happiness!
She kisses him deeply.
It's a good maze.
Anna and Serozha are running, laughing, between the hedges.
It's a game.
She is trying to find her way to him, chasing him.
A hedge divides them.
Serozha darts away from her, runs into a dead end, doubles back.
She spots him, follows him, and now he has eluded her again.
Serozha finds his way out of the maze and is confronted by Karenin.
KARENIN How are you, young man?
KARENIN Your tutor doesn't seem to be in evidence.
KARENIN We'll have a look at your lesson books.
Anna, coming out of the maze, sees Karenin, recovers.
ANNA Alexei!--you got away at last.
ANNA Can you stay?
KARENIN Why .
Serozha looks scared to tears.
Anna kisses him.
ANNA Go and find Vasily Lukich.
Serozha runs into the house.
ANNA (CONT'D) I have to change.
ANNA (CONT'D) Princess Betsy is sending her trap for me.
ANNA (CONT'D) Would you like to come?-- she's taking me to watch the race.
Karenin smiles coldly.
KARENIN Races, surely.
KARENIN No, I'll come on later, and then I must get back to town.
Anna returns to the house.
She wipes her kissed hand on her skirt.
This is a rough-and-ready racecourse but the venue for a high society occa- sion, with a grandstand for top people and a grander section, ornamented for greater comfort, for members of the Imperial family.
It is also a fashion parade for some.
The racecourse itself is an oval approached by a straight.
There are nine fences, water-jumps, etc., of various difficulty.
The "jockeys" are officers in the Guards, the Hussars and other regiments.
Among them is Vronsky, attended by a Trainer who is fussing over Frou- Frou's bridle and calming her.
Vronsky looks with interest at a big power- ful horse which must be Gladiator, with Captain Makhotin already in the saddle.
Makhotin and Vronsky greet each other with a nod.
-- arrives at the races .
making his way towards the front, smiling, raising his hat to acquaintances .
his eyes busy looking for his wife.
He reaches the front and looks up at the Ladies' Stand.
Anna and Betsy are here, and, not far away, so are Countess Vronsky and the Princesses Sorokina: the mother is a fading fortyish; the daughter is eighteen, blonde and pretty.
Below the ladies section is a planked standing area for gentlemen, who also may stand to watch the races from the stepped aisle of the seated section.
Soldiers, Horse People and Locals watch from the turf.
A race is flowing towards the winning post, with accompanying crowd reac- tion, but it is clear from Anna's detachment, exchanging chat with Betsy, that this is not Vronsky's race.
--looks up to the ladies' stand.
Betsy smiles at him in greeting, but Anna seems unaware.
Countess Vronsky appraises the young princess.
COUNTESS VRONSKY Exquisite creature .
COUNTESS VRONSKY you really ought to be the spoil of victory today .
The young princess smiles at her.
Countess Vronsky turns her glasses towards the Starting Post.
Vronsky mounts Frou-Frou.
The Riders move to the starting line.
watches Anna who is looking through her glasses towards the Starting Post while the current race finishes to cheers.
Anna's anxious attention turns to a horse and rider who fell further down the course-- and to the ambulance wagon (with a red cross sewn on it) .
Karenin mounts the steps of the aisle, raising his hat to ladies he knows.
Anna ignores him.
On the wooden boards below, where gentlemen are watching, Oblonsky calls up to Betsy.
OBLONSKY Princess!
OBLONSKY A bet!
OBLONSKY What do you fancy in the next?
BETSY Kusolev.
OBLONSKY I'm on Vronsky.
OBLONSKY A pair of gloves?
BETSY Done!
BETSY Alexander Vronsky .
In the aisle at the top of the stand, Karenin watches as:--
Vronsky's brother Alexander, escorting his wife, Varya, bows to Anna and Betsy, but significantly Varya succeeds in not noticing them.
The riders line up .
and they're off.
The stands and spectators are distant, the first fence coming at him, horses on either side.
His neighbour falls at the fence but Frou-Frou is clear, with Gladiator half a length in front.
The next fence is coming up.
Gladiator and Frou-Frou jump cleanly but a following horse falls badly.
Spectators on either side of Anna and those behind and in front collectively react.
Anna reacts not at all.
Her gaze through her glasses stays unwavering on Vronsky.
Karenin notes this, and from then on his attention is fixed on Anna.
When the horses come opposite the stand, she lowers her glasses and follows Frou-Frou taking the lead from Gladiator.
-- eases Frou-Frou past Gladiator.
The horses take the next jump.
With one hand Anna grips her folded fan.
Karenin's face is a mask as he watches Anna unconsciously half-destroying it.
She raises her glasses.
Frou-Frou approaches the last fence with Gladiator half a length behind, on the near side to Anna.
-- working the reins, rising and falling in rhythm with the horse, looks ahead to the winning post, and before knowing it he makes an error, losing the rhythm, dropping back into the saddle and raising the horse's head, just as Frou-Frou takes off.
Frou-Frou rises, Gladiator rises.
Frou-Frou disappears.
Gladiator clears the fence in Anna's foreground.
Simultaneously, there are shrieks and exclamations all around her-- OFF CAMERA-- and the view through the glasses zigzags in search of Frou-Frou, impeded by horses jumping the fence.
She lowers the glasses and sees Frou-Frou on the ground, rolling over, and Vronsky on the ground.
-- sees this, too, her mouth set tight with contempt.
--looks shocked.
Almost in the same moment he hears Anna's anguished cry, conspicuous in the hubbub that follows the crowd's exclamation.
ANNA Alexei .
KARENIN I'm here.
This is adroit.
He comes down several steps and pushes through to offer his arm, but Anna has lost control, trying to escape like a bird beating against its cage.
KARENIN (CONT'D) Would you like to leave?
Anna ignores him, puts her glasses to her eyes, searching out Vronsky.
Vronsky extricates himself from his broken horse and, in terrible recrimina- tion, tries to pull Frou-Frou to her feet by the reins.
Frou-Frou struggles to get up but her back is broken.
Officials, officers, and a doctor have come running.
sees an Officer hurrying to the Imperial party to report.
ANNA Stiva!
ANNA What are they saying?
OBLONSKY Vronsky's unhurt--but the horse .
Anna relapses into sobs, attempting to hide her face behind her destroyed fan.
Betsy gives Anna her fan.
--is restrained by an Officer.
OFFICER Her back's broken!
The Officer takes a pistol from his holster.
Vronsky, enraged and in grief, takes the pistol from him.
--persists with Anna.
KARENIN I'm asking you .
KARENIN if you wish to go .
He touches Anna's arm.
She jerks it away.
ANNA No, leave me alone.
BETSY I'll bring her home, Alexei.
KARENIN Excuse me, Princess, but Anna is not well and I want her to come with me.
A gunshot is heard from the course.
Anna turns her tear-streaked face towards it.
Anna's hysteria has solidified into a blank despair.
Karenin seems to want to pretend that nothing important has happened.
KARENIN You know .
KARENIN they say the Emperor dis- approves of the races .
KARENIN the danger of injury .
KARENIN but I .
Anna looks at him contemptuously.
ANNA What?
KARENIN I'm saying there is a value in manly sport, for the military--
ANNA I don't understand.
KARENIN In my opinion, it's not the sport itself that's wrong, it's the spectacle, it's making a cruel spectacle out of--
ANNA What are you talking about?
Karenin changes tack.
KARENIN I have to tell you--
ANNA Yes.
KARENIN I have to tell you, you behaved improperly today.
ANNA And how was that?
She has raised her voice.
He raises a warning finger, and reaches to close the communication window behind the coachman's box.
KARENIN By making plain your feelings when one of the riders fell.
KARENIN Your conduct was improper.
KARENIN It must not occur again.
KARENIN I have said it before.
Anna smiles faintly.
He is misled by that.
KARENIN (CONT'D) You are going to say my concern is unneces- sary and ridiculous.
KARENIN (CONT'D) You are my wife.
KARENIN (CONT'D) I am wrong to think that .
KARENIN (CONT'D) yes--perhaps I was mistaken.
Anna looks at him despairingly.
ANNA No, you were not mistaken.
ANNA I love him.
ANNA I am his mistress.
ANNA I can't bear you, I'm afraid of you, I hate you.
ANNA Do what you like to me.
Karenin is literally winded--gasping for breath, slowly getting his breath- ing under control.
Anna huddles away from him in her corner.
Karenin recovers himself only to the point of sitting stock-still, looking at nothing, not moving.
The coach lurches, unbalancing him so that he is pushed against Anna.
He recoils as if from a contamination.
The coach slows.
The coach stops.
A Servant comes to the coach door, opens the door.
KARENIN Wait, please.
KARENIN Move away.
The Servant backs off.
KARENIN (CONT'D) I will not have a scandal.
KARENIN (CONT'D) Therefore .
KARENIN (CONT'D) You will not see .
KARENIN (CONT'D) this man again.
KARENIN (CONT'D) You will behave in such a way that nothing is known against you, by society or by the servants.
KARENIN (CONT'D) In return, you will keep the privileges of a
109 wife--and the duties.
109 Tomorrow you will return home.
109 That is all.
Anna gets out of the coach and runs into the maze.
Anna comes to Vronsky.
She is still shaken by the showdown with Karenin in his coach, but is now overtaken by concern for Vronsky after his fall.
ANNA Are you hurt?
Vronsky shakes his head.
He is moved by the sight of her, full of love and desire, but in her embrace he detects something new, a nervous exaltation.
VRONSKY What's happened?
ANNA I told him I'm your mistress.
Vronsky lifts her face, strokes her cheek.
He waits.
ANNA (CONT'D) He thinks I can give you up and go on living.
He embraces her for that, relieved, grateful, loving--understanding that she is not going to give him up.
VRONSKY No, you cannot.
Imperial hands (the Tsar's for all we know) place over Karenin's head a broad red ribbon from which hangs a heavy medal.
Karenin bows low.
At an ornate doorway a Major-Domo announces.
MAJOR DOMO Their Excellencies Minister Karenin and Madame Karenin!
Karenin, wearing his medal, and Anna smile their way into a party, to a patter of polite applause.
Further grandees are being announced, but are not applauded .
Prince and Princess Berghatskoy .
Ambassador Chamber- lain .
Baron and Baroness Verdlov .
Prince and Princess Tverskoy .
BETSY Alexei Aleksandrevich .
BETSY congratulations.
BETSY You're the only man my husband would do this for.
ANNA Tell me your latest find for your library.
PRINCE TVERSKOY Not in front of the Princess.
Betsy draws Anna away for a moment.
BETSY I can tell you're happy.
BETSY You've put on a little weight.
ANNA Both true.
Anna, in the same dress, kisses Serozha tenderly so as not to wake him, and leaves the room.
Anna enters the suite where Karenin, in his dressing gown, puts down his book.
He is elated by his evening.
KARENIN Time for bed!
Anna is in bed.
Karenin is getting ready for bed.
Anna listens apprehen- sively to the little noises of Karenin's pre-coital preparations.
KARENIN not that I care for decorations but .
ANNA Alexei .
ANNA I can't .
ANNA I'm sorry .
ANNA But I'm his wife now.
ANNA I am having his child.
Karenin stares at her.
He turns back to the open drawer and puts things back the way they were.
He locks the drawer.
He puts on his dressing gown and leaves the room.
Anna waits a moment and follows him.
It's dark.
Anna hears the crack of his knuckles and can see him faintly, sitting in the dark.
KARENIN Tell me what I did to deserve this.
A prospect: next to a country road, a large expanse of meadow is being mown forty swathes at a time by forty mowers swinging their scythes almost in unison.
CLOSER--Levin is suffering but keeping up, bathed in perspiration.
His place is behind an old man, Theodore, who is scything as if without effort.
Just in time for Levin, Theodore calls a halt and takes Levin's scythe to sharpen it with a whetstone.
Levin attracts a few grins and comments.
YOUNG PEASANT Konstantin Dmitrich, you'll know your rows when the field's all done!
Levin's row has stalks of differing heights between the even swathes on either side.
There is some laughter, but the men are uneasy.
It's time to stop for the day.
More tomorrow.
The Mowers with their scythes walk back across the large meadow of cut swathes.
From the other direc- tion, a crowd of Village Women are coming to meet them carrying food and drink.
A fire has been lit.
The Mowers eat their meal in the company of women.
Serafina tends to a cooking pot in the firelight.
Levin watches her discreetly.
He has settled down at a discreet distance from the men.
His attention is caught by a grown-up Boy and his young Wife who have chosen to sit slightly apart.
He is charmed by them, watching the girl serve her husband.
Theodore comes to Levin with a jug.
Levin takes a swig.
LEVIN How many mowers is it, Theodore?
THEODORE Forty-two, master.
THEODORE In your father's time it was work for two days for thirty men .
THEODORE though he never picked up a scythe himself.
The men don't like me for it.
They like what they're used to.
It settles me.
How is that, master?
When I'm mowing, I don't ask myself why I'm here.
You're here to be master, Konstantin Dmi- trich, to be your father's son, and father to a son who will be master after you, as it has always been by the grace of God.
My father owned you, Theodore.
My grand- father owned your father.
Owned you like chattels, to be bought and sold.
Was that by the grace of God?
It was.
Those were good times when your father had the keeping of us.
That's my youngest you were looking at there.
His young life is perilous now since the Free- dom came and work must be found.
LEVIN It's true I was looking at him.
THEODORE At his wife too, I dare say.
Levin is abashed, found out.
LEVIN They look happier than I've ever been.
LEVIN Is it living simply that I'm looking for?
Night under the stars.
Some of the men have gone, some have settled in for the night.
The cooking fire is burning out.
Levin remains where he was, watching, thinking: drawn to "the simple life."
Levin wakes .
woken by hoofbeats and the jingle of harness.
Levin sees a coach coming towards him.
The coach comes nearer, leather boxes strapped to the roof.
Levin sees that a young woman is looking out of the side window, holding on to the white ribbons of her bonnet.
He sees that it is Kitty, on her way to Ergoshovo.
(Princess Shcherbatsky is also inside, dozing.)
The coach passes on, leaving Levin lovelorn, the dawn light on him.
The sight of Kitty has turned him round again.
Vronsky stands at the entrance to the platform holding a bouquet, waiting for a train.
He looks pretty fed up.
As before, the set-up is a small stage, a small auditorium, and an area for drinking, cruising, etc., a combination of music hall and a bar with a few tables.
Vronsky is here as the escort of a Foreign Prince (an Indian), watch- ing a "risque" show with Can-Can Girls, much relished by the visitor.
Vronsky's glance casts about in the gloom.
The champagne is flowing.
Vron- sky spots a trio--Lisa Merkalova, Betsy, and Stremov, a politician and Karenin's rival.
Vronsky catches Betsy's eye.
She beckons him.
He excuses himself to the Foreign Prince, who doesn't notice, and goes over to the other table.
Under the music, he is introduced to Stremov, and kisses the hands of the women.
He takes the empty chair.
VRONSKY He's some kind of prince at home.
VRONSKY Exhaust- ing.
VRONSKY Where is Tuskevitch this evening?
BETSY Why ask me?
At which moment, Makhotin appears at the table.
Vronsky relinquishes his chair.
VRONSKY Captain Makhotin .
Vronsky bows to the women.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) I must leave you.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) I'm on duty tonight.
MAKHOTIN Lucky woman.
MAKHOTIN Give her my respects, and to Karenin if you see him.
Vronsky freezes in anger.
BETSY Don't.
BETSY Would you compromise me?
BETSY And Lisa?
Lisa and Stremov are enjoying it.
Vronsky turns away.
The Foreign Prince is applauding enthusiastically when Vronsky rejoins him.
STREMOV I only say that a man who can't govern his wife has perhaps gone as far as he can go in government.
Vronsky wakes.
He has fallen asleep in his clothes.
A note has been deliv- ered, propped up by the bed.
He reaches for it.
A cab brings Vronsky.
The Karenin coach is waiting outside.
As Vronsky approaches the door, it opens and Kapitonich comes out with a folded rug.
Kapitonich is wrong-footed by seeing him.
Karenin comes out of the door, into the gaslight.
When he sees Vronsky he hesitates for a fraction but con- tinues.
Kapitonich is holding open the door of the coach.
Vronsky bows, Karenin, expressionless, touches his hat and gets into the coach, taking the rug.
Vronsky walks into the house as the coach moves off.
Kapitonich comes in, closing the door.
Vronsky gives him his hat and coat.
KAPITONICH Good evening, Your Excellency.
Kapitonich is uneasy.
A Footman comes from a service door.
He sees Vron- sky and looks to Kapitonich.
VRONSKY I am expected.
Kapitonich nods to the Footman.
Anna, six months pregnant, is seated almost formally.
The Footman lets Vronsky in and retires closing the door.
Anna runs to Vronsky.
ANNA No!--no.
ANNA I will not live like this!
He holds her, calming her, hushing her.
He leads her into a Winter Garden conservatory off the Reception Room.
ANNA (CONT'D) Waiting hour after hour while you're drink- ing champagne with naked actresses-- don't think I don't know!--Lisa Merkalova still calls on me.
VRONSKY It's punishment enough that I'm on escort duty, without .
ANNA Yes--I'm sorry--it's my demon, I can't help it.
VRONSKY You wrote that you were ill.
ANNA Did I?
ANNA Well, I am!
ANNA But don't worry!
ANNA It won't be for long, I'll soon be out of your way--soon!
VRONSKY Stop.
ANNA No, it's true.
ANNA I was told it in a dream.
VRONSKY There, it was only a bad dream.
ANNA Yes, and I'm only going to die having your baby.
VRONSKY That's all nonsense!
She kisses him all over his face.
ANNA Tell me it is, tell me it is.
ANNA You love me.
ANNA Only me.
VRONSKY Your note said your husband would be out.
ANNA He was late.
ANNA Serves him right.
ANNA And you.
ANNA Why do you call him my husband?
ANNA He isn't my husband--he's a clock, a wooden doll--
VRONSKY But it was awkward .
VRONSKY a matter of your honour.
VRONSKY You made an agreement.
Anna flares up again.
ANNA Do you think of my honour when you're sharing whores with your Hindoo!
VRONSKY Your demon again!
ANNA I'll be glad to die, before you start to hate me!
VRONSKY Anna .
Anna gives a gasp.
She laughs.
ANNA Put your hand there.
ANNA There!
ANNA Did you feel him move!
"The Committee" is in session.
Stremov has the floor.
He is referring to a map of Russia on an easel, splotched with colours.
Karenin is there but not listening, his thoughts far away.
STREMOV I must respectfully ask Minister Karenin whether his proposals for the regulation of these colourful Gypsy tribes, of these schol- arly God-fearing Jews, and of--but I'm afraid I have lost the Minister's attention .
All turn to look at Karenin, who sits staring at nothing, unaware even of the pause.
He wakes.
For a beat he hardly knows where he is.
Kapitonich lets Karenin in.
Karenin is brisk.
KARENIN Who is here?
KAPITONICH Only Madame, Your Excellency.
Karenin goes up the staircase.
There is an urgency in him, a fury.
Karenin walks in and goes to her bureau, empties out little drawers and receptacles, looking for the key to the main drawer.
Anna comes in from the bedroom, alarmed, in her nightdress.
ANNA I wanted to see him because .
KARENIN I do not wish to be told why a woman wants to see her lover.
He pulls furiously at the locked drawer, then looks around for an implement.
ANNA What are you .
KARENIN I want his letters.
Karenin finds an iron bootjack.
Anna tries to stop him.
He pushes her aside and smashes the wood around the lock, then, struggling against her, he takes from the open drawer a pretty cardboard box, a good guess.
He confirms that it contains letters.
KARENIN (CONT'D) I am going to Moscow tomorrow, and then to the provinces with a commission to investigate conditions among the Jews and Gypsies--whose conditions I infinitely prefer to my own.
KARENIN (CONT'D) I will not return to this house until divorce has put you into the street.
KARENIN (CONT'D) Meanwhile my son will be sent to live with my eldest sister.
ANNA Alexei .
ANNA please .
ANNA leave me Serozha .
Karenin looks at her with contempt.
KARENIN Do you think I would let you have my son?
KARENIN You are depraved, a woman without honour.
KARENIN I thank God the curse of love is lifted from me.
He walks out with the box of letters.
Oblonsky arrives outside his office building in a cab.
He enters.
Saluted by the Hall Porter, Oblonsky mounts a semi-grand staircase and arrives at the entrance to his department.
He goes in.
Levin stands up in his almost new, hardly used coat, top hat and boots.
OBLONSKY Levin!
OBLONSKY What .
Levin smiles, hopefully, sheepish.
LEVIN I need your advice .
It's a reprise.
Oblonsky understands.
He seizes Levin and kisses him.
A small group.
Dolly is playing the piano.
Kitty turns the pages for Dolly.
The old Prince Shcherbatsky and the Princess are with Countess Nordston and Oblonsky.
COUNTESS NORDSTON Well, is he coming?
Kitty, keeping half an eye on the door, sees Levin enter and misses the page- turn.
Oblonsky goes to greet Levin.
LEVIN Am I late?
LEVIN Who is here?
OBLONSKY Of course you're late!
OBLONSKY Come and meet .
OBLONSKY Countess Nordston.
COUNTESS NORDSTON We nearly met at the Shcherbatsky's last winter.
Levin, puzzled, bows to her and to the Prince and Princess, who are respec- tively pleased and making the best of it, and then to Dolly who approaches.
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY Come into the fold .
DOLLY Kitty is here.
Levin is shaken.
Dolly leads him to Kitty, who is frightened, shy and shamefaced.
Dolly leaves them.
KITTY Konsantin .
KITTY what a long time since we saw each other.
LEVIN Since you saw me, but I saw you not so long ago.
KITTY When?
LEVIN You were driving to Ergoshovo .
LEVIN I was at Kashin for the haymaking.
KITTY Oh, but why didn't you .
They are both embarrassed by the wrong step.
LEVIN I'm so glad to see you.
LEVIN You're just the same.
KITTY I hope not--I was young and silly in those days.
LEVIN Months and months ago!
KITTY And you haven't changed.
LEVIN No.
LEVIN I haven't.
Kitty looks up at him, decoding.
They gauge each other shyly.
OBLONSKY Permit me to announce--soup Marie Lou- ise, carp with asparagus, and roast beef!
OBLONSKY I went to the market in person!
But Matvey at that moment presents Oblonsky with a visiting card on a salver.
Oblonsky reads it.
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) An extra place.
The new arrival is Karenin.
Oblonsky is pleased.
OBLONSKY Karenin!--I'm glad you came.
KARENIN I've been on tour in the regions, a govern- ment commission .
KARENIN I'm sorry--I have come to tell you our connection must be severed.
KARENIN I'm going to divorce your sister.
OBLONSKY Divorce?
OBLONSKY Dear me, what are you talking about?
OBLONSKY Don't be in a hurry.
OBLONSKY Stay to dinner and later talk it over with Dolly--
KARENIN Prince Oblonsky, everything is over between our families.
OBLONSKY Alexei .
OBLONSKY divorce is one thing but dinner is quite another.
Dinner for eight-- clockwise, Oblonsky, Countess Nordston, Prince Shcher- batsky, Kitty, Karenin, Dolly, Levin and Princess Shcherbatsky.
Two Servants and Matvey serve at the table, clearing away the "carp with asparagus."
The Princess is challenging Karenin.
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY You Petersburgers think yourselves so de bon ton compared with dull, old-fashioned
128 Moscow, but we know how to do things-- only the other day, I hear, Vasya Pryachnikov fought a duel with Kvitsky and killed him.
Oblonskky attempts to divert the conversation.
OBLONSKY Well, what's this government commission, Karenin .
But Karenin ignores him.
Oblonsky looks on helplessly.
KARENIN What was the challenge about?
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY Pryachnikov's wife, naturally.
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY It was a matter of honour, defending a woman's honour .
Karenin remains cool.
KARENIN It sounds like barbarism to me .
KARENIN And what if the lover had killed the husband?-- would that have preserved the wife's honour too?
COUNTESS NORDSTON Still, not many of us can say that our lover died for love!
KARENIN Love?
KARENIN Thou shall not covet thy neighbour's wife.
COUNTESS NORDSTON Would you die for love, Konstantin Dmitrich?
LEVIN I would.
LEVIN But not for my neighbour's wife.
Levin is nettled to find that he seems to have made a joke, for the Countess especially.
Kitty remains serious, watching Levin, loving him.
LEVIN (CONT'D) An impure love is not love, to me.
LEVIN (CONT'D) To admire another man's wife is a pleasant thing, but sensual desire indulged for its own sake is greed, a kind of gluttony, and a misuse of something sacred which is given to us so that we may choose the one person with whom to fulfill our humanness.
LEVIN (CONT'D) Otherwise we might as well be cattle.
COUNTESS NORDSTON Ah, an idealist!
Reconciliatory laughter eases the atmosphere.
Levin feels abashed at coming out of his shell.
He steals a glance at Kitty and finds her looking at him.
She smiles at him and drops her eyes.
The dinner party settles in.
Dolly and Karenin sit knee-to-knee in a corner.
DOLLY but she will be nobody's wife, she'll be ruined.
KARENIN I tried to save her.
KARENIN She chose ruin.
DOLLY Alexei Aleksandrevich--look at me.
DOLLY You will have no peace of mind until you forgive her.
DOLLY It was Anna who taught me that.
KARENIN I do not wish to forgive.
KARENIN I am not a cruel man.
KARENIN I have never hated anyone.
KARENIN But I hate her with all my soul for all the wrong she has done me.
Levin and Kitty are at the card table, with a spillage of the alphabet pieces.
OBLONSKY It's your turn to play us something, Countess.
LEVIN Since we last met, there is something I have often wanted to ask you.
KITTY What is that?
Levin sorts through the alphabet pieces as though he is putting off the moment, but he quickly puts four letters spaced out in a row: D N M N.
LEVIN This.
Kitty tries.
KITTY Do Not .
Levin adds an I next to the D.
KITTY (CONT'D) Did.
KITTY (CONT'D) Did Not.
Levin shakes his head.
He adds an E next to the second N. Kitty concentrates.
KITTY (CONT'D) The last word is Never.
Levin nods.
Kitty puts letters in place.
They read DID NO MEAN
Levin looks into her eyes.
Kitty finds letters and presents Levin with T I D N K. Levin adds NOW to the K. Kitty nods.
Levin adds OT to the N. Kitty nods.
Levin adds an O to the D. Kitty shakes her head.
She puts an H after the T.
LEVIN I know what it says.
Dolly, looking across the room, sees Kitty and Levin serious and smiling, rapt.
Levin places extra letters: THEN I DID NOT KNOW.
Kitty nods.
LEVIN (CONT'D) Then.
LEVIN (CONT'D) But now?
Kitty finds C Y F A F.
LEVIN (CONT'D) Can You.
Kitty nods.
LEVIN (CONT'D) Can you Forgive.
LEVIN (CONT'D) And Forget.
Levin puts down I L Y.
LEVIN (CONT'D) I never stopped .
He looks up to see silent tears streaming down her face.
His own eyes flood.
Karenin walks away from the Oblonsky house.
He lifts his face to meet the snowflakes.
He looks tortured.
Snow melts on his face like tears.
He takes from his wallet a telegram.
KARENIN Die, then.
He stands in the snow, uncertain.
Karenin sits like a statue.
Karenin is let into the house by Kapitonich.
KARENIN How is your mistress?
KAPITONICH Safely delivered of a daughter, Your Excellency.
KARENIN So .
KARENIN she is well?
KAPITONICH The mistress is very poorly.
KAPITONICH The doctor .
Karenin, going to the stairs, sees Vronsky's cloak and cap on the coat stand.
Karenin comes up the staircase.
When he reaches his dressing room he hears Anna shouting for "Alexei" in her delirium.
He hesitates.
Anna shouts the name again.
Karenin enters Anna's boudoir.
Karenin sees Vronsky sitting with his hands over his face.
Vronsky jumps up in confusion.
VRONSKY She's dying.
VRONSKY Please let me stay.
Karenin looks at him coldly and enters the bedroom.
Anna is not seeing or hearing, struggling against the Doctor and the Mid- wife, while Annushka holds her hand.
DOCTOR Thank God!
DOCTOR She talks only of you.
In her delirium, Anna keeps up a bright prattle.
ANNA Why doesn't he come?
ANNA He is kind.
ANNA He will forgive me.
MIDWIFE He's here--look--look--can't you see him?
ANNA I want Alexei!
ANNA Why doesn't he come?
ANNA Give me some water.
ANNA No, I mustn't, it's not good for my little girl.
ANNA Or let her have a nurse.
ANNA Yes--don't bring her here, because Alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her.
ANNUSHKA He's come, my dear--look there .
Annushka gives way to Karenin, who kneels by the bed, taking Anna's hand.
DOCTOR More ice.
Annushka hurries out.
ANNA Oh, what nonsense.
ANNA I must be asleep, that's what it is.
ANNA You think he won't forgive me but you don't know him.
ANNA No one knows him except me.
ANNA I'm not afraid of him now.
Karenin gazes at her.
He looks at her as he's never looked at her.
ANNA (CONT'D) I'm afraid of death, though.
Karenin tries to speak but cannot.
He starts making shushing noises as to a baby.
She quietens down.
She seems to recognise him.
ANNA (CONT'D) Oh, my dear.
ANNA (CONT'D) Don't look at me like that.
ANNA (CONT'D) I am not the one you think.
ANNA (CONT'D) I'm afraid of her.
ANNA (CONT'D) She fell in love with another man.
ANNA (CONT'D) I'm the real one.
ANNA (CONT'D) But I'm dying now, then she'll be dead, too.
ANNA (CONT'D) Poor man!
ANNA (CONT'D) Let him come in.
ANNA (CONT'D) Alexis!
ANNA (CONT'D) Alexis!
Vronsky hears her calling.
He comes into the bedroom.
Vronsky covers his face, unmanned.
The Doctor nods to the Midwife-- "Leave them alone."
They leave.
ANNA Take your hands away from your face.
ANNA Look at my husband.
ANNA He's a saint!
ANNA Take his hand.
ANNA Alexei--take his hands away.
Karenin pulls Vronsky's fingers, and holds on to Vronsky's hand.
ANNA (CONT'D) Forgive him, too.
ANNA (CONT'D) Thank God, thank God .
Anna is asleep.
Karenin is alone with her.
The crisis seems to be over.
She opens her eyes.
ANNA (CONT'D) So you came.
Karenin puts his face down to her shoulder.
She strokes him.
ANNA (CONT'D) If I had died as I wanted, you would be free of your troubles at last.
KARENIN I am free of them.
Anna closes her eyes and sleeps again.
Karenin comes in.
Vronsky is there.
He looks up abjectly.
VRONSKY Whatever you think of me, please believe me, I love her--I could not have done other- wise than what I .
VRONSKY what I did.
Karenin nods and sits next to him.
KARENIN But you must leave now.
KARENIN I promise to send for you if she asks for you.
KARENIN I don't know what happened.
KARENIN I forgive you.
KARENIN I forgive Anna.
KARENIN My soul is filled with joy.
KARENIN I will remain with her and look after her for ever.
Karenin stands up and offers his hand.
Vronsky grasps it and starts shaking.
KARENIN (CONT'D) Come now, come now .
Karenin embraces him, comforting him.
Vronsky arrives back at his flat .
and finds his mother waiting for him in his sitting room.
COUNTESS VRONSKY Look at you.
COUNTESS VRONSKY You look like what you are.
COUNTESS VRONSKY A laughingstock.
COUNTESS VRONSKY I fancy you are to be asked to leave the regiment.
VRONSKY I would like you to go, Maman.
COUNTESS VRONSKY I will go when I'm ready to go.
COUNTESS VRONSKY A little affair with a married woman puts a finish- ing touch to a young man's education--but this morbid, selfish obsession .
COUNTESS VRONSKY You have publicly humiliated a man who has devoted his life to Russia, and it will not be forgot- ten.
COUNTESS VRONSKY You'd better come back to Moscow with me.
COUNTESS VRONSKY You're finished here.
VRONSKY In Petersburg?
VRONSKY I'm finished here.
For the first time, Vronsky is wearing civilian clothes .
looking reflect- ingly at his uniform hanging in his wardrobe.
He places his cavalry cap carefully on a shelf and closes the wardrobe.
Levin is half-dressed in clothes to be married in, assisted by Matvey and watched over by Oblonsky, who is in wedding clothes.
Levin is frantic.
Oblonsky is perplexed.
Matvey is unflappable, holding Levin's coat ready and following him around.
LEVIN no, I'll go to her and tell her it's not too late to stop this business!
LEVIN Better now than when we're married and she realises she doesn't love me!
OBLONSKY But she does love you!
LEVIN How can she?
LEVIN I mean, look at me!
LEVIN Suppose she's only marrying me to get married?
LEVIN Suppose she's still in love with Vronsky?
LEVIN She's making a terrible mistake!
LEVIN I'll go to her and tell her she's free, that's what I must do .
MATVEY Your coat, sir.
Levin snatches the coat and puts it on, and dashes out of the room.
Levin, in disarray, is let into the house.
The entrance hall is crowded, loud and chaotic with children, maids, governesses and Kitty's mother.
Tanya, Masha and Lili are bridesmaids.
Grisha is a page.
Princess Shcherbatsky, trying to create order among last-minute bouquet distribution, hair- adjustments, shoe-changing, etc., sees Levin and explodes.
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY Konstantin!--what-- ?
LEVIN I have to talk to Kitty.
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY You're not allowed to see her!
Levin gallops up the stairs.
Kitty, dressed for the church, is whispering into the crack of the bedroom door.
KITTY No.
KITTY I don't understand at all!
KITTY What's the matter with you?
LEVIN You can't love me.
LEVIN Think it over!
LEVIN Let people say what they like!
KITTY Are you mad?
KITTY Have you changed your mind?
LEVIN Yes.
LEVIN If you don't love me.
KITTY But I do love you!
Levin hesitates, desperate.
LEVIN Do you?
LEVIN Well, I love you!
KITTY Oh, Konstantin!
They link hands through the opening, each with a hand to kiss.
A mere fragment of a long and ornate marriage ceremony .
The grizzled Priest lights two decorated candles, holding them askew in his left hand, and he uses his right hand to touch Levin and, more tenderly, Kitty.
He gives the couple the candles, Kitty taking hers in her gloved hand.
Levin looks blissfully at Kitty.
The Priest lifts crowns from their heads, and invites them to kiss each other, relieving them of their candles.
The Choir bursts with pride.
The baby girl, two months old, is being fed by a Wet Nurse.
Replete, the baby is given over to the Nursemaid who lays the child in her crib.
Karenin watches all this.
The women ignore him: they are used to him now, and Karenin is harmless.
Karenin stares fascinated at the baby, who stares back.
Anna stares at herself in the mirror.
The act of raising a pair of scissors is an effort.
She isolates a thick lock of her hair, and snips it off.
Anna's hair is short all over.
She sits up in bed, listening to Princess Betsy, who has brought the current gossip.
BETSY and there was her husband wearing her best ballgown, rouge all over his face .
BETSY ma chere, le scandale!
BETSY But I'd better tell you some regimental news .
Karenin enters and sees a glamorous Footman standing in the entrance hall, holding a white fur cape.
KARENIN Who is here?
FOOTMAN Princess Elisabeth Federovna Tverskaya, Your Excellency.
Karenin approaches the bedroom door.
anna (O.C.)
No--I don't want to see him.
betsy (O.C.)
but your husband surely wouldn't .
Anna sees Karenin who is about to retreat.
KARENIN Please excuse me.
ANNA No--stay.
BETSY I am so glad to see you.
BETSY Everyone asks after you.
Karenin bows to her and kisses Anna's hand.
KARENIN You look feverish.
BETSY We have been talking too much--so I'm going.
ANNA Princess Betsy came to tell me .
ANNA I don't want to hide anything from you .
ANNA Count Vronsky asked to come to say goodbye--he's going away.
ANNA I have said I can't receive him.
Betsy kisses Anna.
BETSY Goodbye, my treasure.
Karenin follows Betsy out.
Anna gives in to a moment of grief, and recovers herself when she hears the crack of Karenin's knuckles.
He comes in.
KARENIN I agree with you.
KARENIN As he is going away, there is no need for Count Vronsky to come here.
I have just said so, so there's no need to repeat it.
But it is for you to decide.
Yes, and I decided.
Then I am very glad that--
That we agree, so perhaps we can stop talk- ing about it.
Of course.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yes, can you please please please stop crack- ing your knuckles.
I'm a bad woman.
But I can't breathe.
Your kindness which I can't repay, and your
You begged me for my forgiveness.
But I didn't die and now I have to live with it!
If only you would have gone on hating me.
But then--what?
What?
What do you want?
Do you know what you want?
Do you want to see Count Vronsky?
Not to say goodbye.
I can't hear.
Not to say goodbye.
You would be lost.
Irretrievably lost.
You would have no position.
And worse if we divorce.
You would be the guilty party.
That means you cannot legally remarry.
Your union with Count Vronsky would be illegitimate, and so would your daughter who now has the protection of my name.
And that is what you want!
It would be a sin to help you destroy yourself.
You forget something.
Count Vronsky and I love each other.
And this love sanctifies a criminal folly?
ANNA All I know is that I sent him away and it's as if I'd shot myself through the heart!
KARENIN I see.
KARENIN And Serozha .
It's the crux for Anna, and she is prepared for it.
ANNA I would die for him, but I won't live like this for him.
ANNA When he knows about love, he'll forgive me.
Karenin can see where this takes him.
KARENIN Then I must choose the smaller sin.
KARENIN Vronsky robbed me of my cloak and I will give him my coat.
KARENIN I will give you grounds to divorce me, and I'll accept the scandal, the humilia- tion and the consequences to my career.
ANNA No .
ANNA I can't .
KARENIN You may write to him but I would prefer you not to see him until you have left this house.
Two coaches, each with considerable luggage, have a rendezvous, one coach on the bridge.
Anna is holding Baby Anya.
Annushka and the Nurse are with her.
Vronsky, in civilian clothes, is alone, looking anxiously out of the window.
Anna gives the baby to the Nurse, as the coach halts.
Anna gets out of her coach and runs the few yards to Vronsky's coach.
He opens the door for her.
Anna is kissing Vronsky's face and being kissed, weeping, smiling.
VRONSKY You look like a boy.
VRONSKY But so pale.
VRONSKY We'll go south .
VRONSKY to the sea air and sunshine .
Early morning.
In a big untidy bed, Vronsky and Anna lie asleep, naked and satiated.
The style of the room, and the warmth of the light, tell of the journey made, confirmed by the view from the window, an attractive panorama from an elevation above the sea.
In the room, there are open, unpacked or partly unpacked trunks and cases, and, abandoned untidily, Anna's and Vronsky's clothes.
Slyudin is in attendance on Karenin at his desk.
SLYUDIN and Madame Odette in person, so to speak, Your Excellency, with your permission .
A respectful cough at the door reveals an obsequious male Shopkeeper.
Kar- enin is bewildered.
KARENIN Madame Odette .
SHOPKEEPER Excuse the liberty, Your Excellency .
SHOPKEEPER it's for a bonnet and some ribbons Her Excel- lency has overlooked.
SHOPKEEPER If you wish us to address ourselves to Her Excellency, please be so good as to tell us where we might .
Karenin is stricken into immobility, his face hiding in one propped-up hand.
A tear falls on the blotter.
Slyudin rescues him, ushering the Shopkeeper out.
Countess Lydia arrives in full fluttering cry.
LYDIA I have forced my way in!
LYDIA I have heard!
KARENIN Countess, every shopkeeper has heard.
LYDIA My dear friend!
LYDIA Don't give way to sorrow.
LYDIA Our Lord Jesus Christ has you in his care.
KARENIN No, I'm done for.
KARENIN I don't understand any- thing.
KARENIN All day long I'm being asked to make decisions about bills and servants, the kitchen, Serozha's clothes .
LYDIA I understand.
LYDIA I understand everything.
LYDIA I am going to act.
LYDIA The household arrangements you can leave to me.
LYDIA I will come every day.
LYDIA I will be a second mother to Serozha.
He clasps both her hands and kisses them.
Lydia falls to her knees.
LYDIA (CONT'D) He that humbleth himself shall be exalted!
LYDIA (CONT'D) You must not thank me.
LYDIA (CONT'D) Thank Him whose love pours through me!
The sleigh brings Levin and Kitty home through deep snow all around.
The house comes into view.
They have been on honeymoon travels, attested by hotel labels on the lug- gage.
Kitty, eager and anxious, looks at the approaching house.
Not too bad.
Levin takes her hand.
She smiles at him, to calm him.
Agafia and Vasili come out on the porch.
The house has been painted, the window frames smartened up, and paper flowers are tied to the posts of the porch.
The sleigh pulls up.
Levin carries Kitty through the snow to the porch.
Agafia bobs.
Vasili bows.
LEVIN This is Agafia, and Vasili, the steward .
LEVIN My wife, Ekaterina Alexandrovna Levin.
KITTY I am very pleased to meet you both.
Kuzma sidles by with a bow and goes to take the luggage from the sleigh.
LEVIN And that was Kuzma.
LEVIN Come inside!
VASILI Careful--door's still a bit .
VASILI it's all right, it'll be dry tomorrow .
Levin shows Kitty in.
He is immensely relieved.
It never looked better.
At the same time he realises that Agafia is agitated: a word in private.
LEVIN Is it all right?
Kitty nods, smiles gamely--it's not like home.
LEVIN (CONT'D) Sit down a minute.
KITTY No--I want to see everything.
Agafia panics.
LEVIN A moment.
Levin follows Agafia out.
Agafia follows Levin up the stairs.
She is outraged.
AGAFIA and now I'm doing kitchen maid's work because Nadya's parents won't let her set foot in this house, and who can blame them!--it's indecent!
Levin enters the small bedroom.
Agafia waits outside.
Nikolai is in the bed-- wasted, near death.
He lies in squalor.
Masha is wiping his face.
She stands up at Levin's approach.
Levin bends over Niko- lai, presses his gaunt hand.
Nikolai opens his eyes.
LEVIN It's me, Konstantin.
NIKOLAI Yes, good.
NIKOLAI The doctor here is useless--get me a doctor from Moscow.
LEVIN Where did you go?
LEVIN I asked for you every- where, when I was getting married.
Nikolai sighs and closes his eyes.
Levin retreats, looks to Masha.
MASHA I'm sorry .
MASHA I couldn't leave him.
MASHA I know I've done wrong.
LEVIN Yes.
LEVIN My wife .
LEVIN You can't stay now.
Levin goes outside to Agafia and closes the door.
AGAFIA I couldn't go against Nikolai Dmitrich's orders .
LEVIN Yes--yes .
LEVIN She's going.
An unwelcome thought strikes Levin.
LEVIN (CONT'D) Did the doctor see her?
Agafia nods guiltily.
Kitty has remained.
Levin, in miserable agony, is sitting holding her hand.
LEVIN I will nurse him with Agafia .
LEVIN The woman will find somewhere in the village.
LEVIN You won't see her.
LEVIN She knows it's impossible for you to meet her.
LEVIN It is a torment to me that I have brought you under the same roof
155 as this unfortunate .
155 this fallen .
155 and in your precious, in your delicate condition .
Kitty detaches herself abruptly and leaves the room.
He hears her going upstairs.
After a moment, he follows.
Kitty comes out of the Guest Bedroom.
KITTY Good.
KITTY A clean nightshirt and sheets.
KITTY A towel and a clean pail of warm water.
KITTY Ask Agafia for vinegar, and to prepare a bed somewhere for Masha.
KITTY Wait.
Kitty goes back into the room and returns at once with a chamber-pot which she thrusts at Levin.
KITTY (CONT'D) And bring the perfume bottle in the outside pocket of my handbag.
She goes back into the room and doesn't return.
Levin, humbled, goes down the stairs.
Nikolai has been stripped.
Masha washes his body.
Kitty enters with her arms full of clean linen.
Nikolai lies naked in clean sheets.
Masha hauls him up into a sitting posi- tion.
Kitty puts a nightshirt over his head.
Nikolai protests feebly.
KITTY I'm not looking.
Masha and Kitty pull the nightshirt over his body.
Kitty pulls the sheet up over him.
Masha adjusts the fresh pillow.
She combs his hair (and beard).
Nikolai lies quietly in a neat bed in the neat room, with medicine and water jug, etc., tidily by the bed.
Masha keeps vigil by candlelight, holding his hand, singing to him quietly.
NIKOLAI I'm going .
Levin comes into the room he shared with his brother.
The room has been abandoned for years .
two bare beds, a washstand, a wooden chest.
It contains a jumble of books, shoes, a pair of skates.
Levin hears sleigh bells arriving.
The sleigh draws up, bringing a Priest.
Levin, feeling out of place, is at the washstand.
He notices there is a prettily wrapped new cake of soap.
He picks it up and puts it to his nose.
Masha and Kitty are kneeling by the bed.
The Priest bends over Nikolai holding up an icon in front of Nikolai's face and murmuring the prayers.
Levin, embarrassed, puts down the soap and comes forward and kneels too.
Nikolai is at the point of death.
Levin stares, torn between the mystery and the lack of mystery, the ordinariness of the body finally wearing out.
The death rattle comes.
Masha kisses the dead hand.
The Priest continues to murmur.
Kitty takes hold of Masha's hand.
Levin stares into Nikolai's face: if this is death, what is life?
Nikolai lies dead, candles burning at his head and feet.
Levin counts money, for the services of the Priest .
who is eating bread and soup.
LEVIN Thank you, Father .
LEVIN and how much .
He offers a handful of paper money.
PRIEST At your benevolence.
PRIEST It is a custom, not a levy, Your Excellency .
PRIEST Jesus overturned the money-tables outside the temple, but .
He shrugs and puts the money away, and returns to his soup.
The snow is almost gone.
Nikolai's grave has flowers strewn on the mound.
Pava's yearling and several more calves, delirious with release, mill through the yard with the herd, to pasture, with a Herdsman and Laska urging them on.
Masha is leaving, alone behind the Coachman.
She sits quietly and doesn't look back.
Levin and Kitty watch her drive away.
KITTY You're such an expert on love, Kostya .
KITTY why didn't you know it when you saw it?
Lydia hurries along grand deserted hallways.
She knows her way.
A door ahead of her opens and a dozen Politicians and Civil Servants carrying portfolios cross her path, with Stremov at the centre of their unheard conver- sation.
Stremov is smiling, triumphant.
Lydia expects to see Karenin among them.
She hurries on to the door they came from.
When Lydia enters, Karenin, alone in the chamber, is sitting immobile, defeated.
He starts gathering his papers.
Lydia comes to him.
Her agitation explained, she takes an opened letter from her bag.
LYDIA Alexei, they're back!
LYDIA Here in St.
LYDIA Petersburg!
LYDIA She has written to me.
Karenin accepts the letter and reads it.
KARENIN To you?
KARENIN I think I don't have the right to refuse .
KARENIN It's the boy's birthday .
LYDIA My friend .
LYDIA you would be blowing on the embers of a fire which must be allowed to die .
LYDIA Let me write to her.
Anna is looking into the display window of a toy shop.
She is excited, glow- ing.
She enters the shop.
Returning from the toy shop with a wrapped parcel, Anna comes in.
Luggage is stacked up in the hallway and Franz is unpacking stuff in the main room.
She sees that a hand-delivered letter is waiting for her.
She opens it.
Anna reads the letter.
For a moment she is devastated by it--but then, furious, she tears it up.
It's very early morning.
The street is not awake.
A hired cab brings Anna to her former home.
She is heavily veiled, and carries the wrapped parcel from the toy shop.
The cab is to wait for her.
She rings the doorbell.
A sleepy Servant opens the big wooden door.
ANNA I'm here to see Sergei Alexeyich.
The young Servant doesn't know her.
Anna steps past him, pushing money into his hand.
Kapitonich, pulling on his livery greatcoat, comes to the inner glass door and lets Anna in.
He does not recognise her.
ANNA I have brought something for Sergei Alexeyich.
Kapitonich scrutinises her, prepared to forestall her.
KAPITONICH He is not up yet.
KAPITONICH Would you wish to wait?
KAPITONICH Who shall I say .
Kapitonich peers at her and realises who she is.
He steps back and bows.
KAPITONICH (CONT'D) Please come in, Your Excellency.
Anna goes quickly to the stairs.
KAPITONICH (CONT'D) Allow me to announce you.
KAPITONICH (CONT'D) The tutor may be there and not dressed.
Anna shakes her head and is almost running away from him.
Kapitonich gives chase.
KAPITONICH Please allow me!
Anna dashes past two Housemaids who gape at her, and disappears round the corner.
She's a little mad now.
Anna, wild-eyed, climbs the stairs and meets the tutor, Vasily Lukich, coming down, buttoning his waistcoat.
Lukich is startled, not knowing her.
ANNA I've come to see Sergei Alexeyich.
Kapitonich reaches these stairs, calling, "Your Excellency .
!"
Anna dashes for Serozha's door and flings herself through it.
It's no longer Serozha's room.
A large Woman sits up in bed.
She's probably the Cook.
She cries out.
Anna reels back.
She looks panicked.
Kapitonich catches up, out of breath.
KAPITONICH He's been moved to the small sitting room.
At the bottom of the Upper Stairs, Lukich, the Housemaids and a couple of half-dressed Footmen have their heads together.
They move aside as Anna hurries by, seeing nothing.
Kapitonich catches up with Anna at the door of the "small sitting room."
KAPITONICH I'll just look in.
Anna shakes her head and walks past him, into the room.
The curtains are drawn closed.
The room is dim.
Anna sees Serozha sitting up, yawning, his eyes closed, and falling back on the pillow.
She comes to the bed and whispers his name.
Serozha raises himself on his elbow, opens his eyes and smiles dreamily and falls forward into her arms.
SEROZHA Mama.
ANNA Oh, my dear little boy.
SEROZHA I knew you would come.
SEROZHA Today is my birthday.
Serozha rubs his face on her neck, falls back on the pillow, only half awake and going back to sleep.
Anna looks at him avidly, touching his forearms, his shoulders, the hair over his ears.
She can't stop her own tears.
He comes awake.
SEROZHA (CONT'D) Are you crying?
ANNA I won't cry.
ANNA It's time for you to get dressed.
ANNA And I almost forgot your present, look .
ANNA open it .
Serozha takes off her hat.
SEROZHA You don't want that .
SEROZHA Let me see.
Serozha tears open the package, lifts the lid of the cardboard box and finds a puppet, a beautifully dressed marionette.
SEROZHA (CONT'D) Oh, he's grand!
Korney, the Valet, among others, has joined the "conference" and is blaming Kapitonich.
KORNEY It's your fault for letting her in!--you should be sacked.
KAPITONICH Oh yes, you would have sent her packing!
KAPITONICH Ten years I've been keeping the door and the mistress was always kind to me.
KAPITONICH You should stick to stealing the master's clothes.
LUKICH I've had enough of this--it's my job to get the boy out of bed before His Excellency comes .
Lukich cautiously opens the door.
He sees mother and son working the pup- pet and laughing quietly.
Lukich backs off.
Anna looks round to see the door closing.
ANNA Darling Kutik, Maman can't stay .
Serozha clings to Anna.
SEROZHA Don't go!--he's not coming yet.
ANNA Yes, I must, and you must love Papa-- he's better than I am.
ANNA When you're grown-up .
SEROZHA No one in the whole world is better than you.
Anna hugs him.
The Servants in a huddle look round at the sound of a door, and approach- ing footsteps round a blind corner.
There is no one in view when Karenin comes around the corner.
The Ser- vants have vanished.
He goes to Serozha's door.
Anna comes out.
He stops, astonished.
Anna looks at him boldly, then pulls down her veil.
Karenin bows.
Anna walks past him.
Anna comes "home" from Karenin's house.
The visit has changed her.
She sits down in her hat and coat.
Annushka comes in.
ANNA Where's Anya?
ANNUSHKA She's still asleep.
ANNUSHKA Should I take your coat?
Anna shakes her head.
ANNUSHKA (CONT'D) Are you feeling unwell, Madame?
ANNA I'm not sleeping.
ANNUSHKA I can send out for something.
Anna nods.
Twilight.
Anna appears not to have moved.
The baby is heard crying in another room.
Anna's face remains set, but she reacts on hearing Vronsky coming in.
VRONSKY Why are you in the dark?
He turns on a gaslight.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Yashvin is going to call .
VRONSKY (CONT'D) you remember him.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Are you going out?
ANNA To where?
ANNA To whom?
VRONSKY What's the matter?
ANNA I didn't know what happened to you.
VRONSKY But I told you yesterday .
VRONSKY My brother .
ANNA Does it take all day for you to meet your brother?
ANNA Does he need you more than I do?
Vronsky sits next to her and puts his arms round her.
VRONSKY What's happened?
Anna shakes her head.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Well .
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Alexander agreed to everything.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Mother's house in Moscow will go to him, and the country estate will be our new home .
VRONSKY (CONT'D) as soon as the divorce .
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Karenin hasn't answered your letter yet?
Anna shakes her head.
She stands up at last and takes off her hat.
Yashvin is a welcome visitor.
YASHVIN It's wonderful to have you both returned.
ANNA How good you are to come.
ANNA You're the very first person to call on me since our return.
Yashvin gets the point of that.
He is embarrassed.
ANNA (CONT'D) I received a note from Princess Betsy asking me if I'd call on her between six-thirty and eight.
ANNA (CONT'D) Or was it seven?
Yashvin got the point of that, too.
ANNA (CONT'D) Alas, between six-thirty and seven is just when I'm unable to see her!
YASHVIN But perhaps you'll meet at the opera tonight?
ANNA I would love to be there if I could get a box.
YASHVIN Madame, your box is number four!
YASHVIN You'll find me there with Princess Myagkaya.
YASHVIN Will you come, Vronsky?
Vronsky shakes his head.
Yashvin kisses Anna's hand.
ANNA I see why .
ANNA Alexei is so fond of you.
Yashvin laughs and bows himself out.
VRONSKY You know you can't go to the theatre?
ANNA Annushka!
VRONSKY For heaven's sake--
Annushka comes.
ANNA A bath.
ANNA I'll come in and choose a dress.
Annushka goes.
VRONSKY Anna--I implore you--don't you know .
ANNA I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've done: are you ashamed for me?
ANNA Why do you keep a room at the hotel?
ANNA Aren't we together?
ANNA Have you changed towards me?
VRONSKY It's because I love you and care about you.
ANNA If that's the case, I don't know why you aren't coming with me.
VRONSKY That would make it worse.
ANNA You're afraid.
ANNA Well, I'm not.
Before the performance, the stairs, galleries and corridors, giving access to the stalls and boxes, are crowded with the town's highest society.
And Anna, at her most beautiful, is magically cleaving through it.
Awareness of her presence is like a contagion, and yet everyone manages not to catch her eye .
so while all around her there are people impeding each other with greetings, Anna's path opens before her.
She knows what is happening.
It shocks her but her eyes barely show it.
The spell is broken by Princess Myagkaya (she of the 85 kopek sauce) who hails her.
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Anna .
She picks up on the surrounding effect of this, and rubs it in with mischief, taking Anna's arm.
princess myagkaya (cont'd) Something has done you good--you look wonderful.
Vronsky sits and broods.
Angrily, he changes his mind.
He jumps up call- ing for Franz.
Vronsky's cab draws up outside the brightly lit, deserted opera house.
He alights.
Vronsky comes up the stairs.
The place is deserted, apart from Atten- dants .
one of whom takes Vronsky's cloak and gives him a token.
On stage, Act One is just ending, and the curtain falls.
The applause gives way to chatter.
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Should we visit or stay put?
Anna sees Vronsky entering on the side-aisle below.
He looks up at the boxes, seeking her.
She turns away.
ANNA Stay put.
Princess Myagkaya has engaged the attention of Stremov in the neighbour- ing box.
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Minister!
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Congratulations.
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Come in for a moment.
But Stremov only bows coldly and turns away.
Yashvin notes this and begins to chew his moustache anxiously.
Anna's neighbour on the other side, a meek husband of a battle-axe, admires her openly.
Anna sees that Vronsky has stopped to talk to Countess Vronsky and the Princesses Sorokina.
The young Princess seems animated by Vronsky, who bows himself away.
Princess Myagkaya sees where Anna is looking.
princess myagkaya (cont'd) Princess Sorokina and her daughter, they're from Moscow, neighbours of Countess Vron- sky, quite well off, no sons, she's a widow.
Anna gives her a smiling but wounded look.
princess myagkaya (cont'd) My dear, I'm a sales catalogue.
Vronsky meets Alexander in the aisle and greets him.
VRONSKY You'll come up to see us afterwards .
ALEXANDER Talk to Varya.
Alexander indicates his seat to Vronsky.
Vronsky sits by Varya.
VRONSKY Will you call on Anna?
VARYA Oh, Alexei .
VARYA I'm fond of you .
VARYA but .
VRONSKY For God's sake, Anna isn't a criminal!
VARYA I'd call on her if she'd only broken the law.
VARYA But she broke the rules.
Vronsky is angry and offended.
He gets up, bows to Varya.
When he looks up, he sees Betsy beckoning to him from her box.
Anna watches Vronsky, sees him acknowledge Betsy's summons.
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Who has made the decor?
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Haven't we got a programme?
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Colonel, would you be so kind .
YASHVIN Of course.
Anna's neighbour, emboldened, offers her his programme.
NEIGHBOUR Please .
NEIGHBOUR I would be honoured if you would take mine .
ANNA Thank you, how very .
The Neighbour's Wife, catching this, reacts as though electrocuted.
Princess Betsy is smoking.
Prince Tverskoy is examining an ancient book.
Vronsky enters the box.
He bows to the Prince, and kisses Betsy's hand.
PRINCE TVERSKOY Catullus, printed in Venice, 1501 .
PRINCE TVERSKOY remarkable.
A grovelling House Manager appears in their midst, to tell Betsy she can't smoke in the box.
HOUSE MANAGER A thousand apologies, Princess, but .
Princess Betsy blows smoke and hands the cigarette, in its holder, to a figure standing quietly in the shadowy corner of the box: Makhotin.
Makhotin takes the cigarette from the holder, crushes it in his left palm.
He feels humiliated .
but that's love.
The House Manger bows and leaves.
VRONSKY Captain Makhotin .
The Angry Wife's voice cuts through the audience chatter.
WIFE'S VOICE It's a disgrace!
WIFE'S VOICE Take me home!
Vronsky turns round to look.
He sees the Husband trying to calm his Wife.
WIFE Fetch my cloak!
Vronsky sees Anna looking straight ahead.
Yashvin is eating his moustache.
The scene next door is a social catastrophe for Anna, but she is riding it.
Princess Myagkaya takes her hand.
Yashvin shrinks into his corner, morti- fied.
The whole opera house is becoming aware of the "scandal."
The Angry Wife has raised her voice.
WIFE What are we coming to?
The Husband has succeeded in putting his wife's cloak over her shoulders.
Her exit line is for the benefit of the entire audience.
WIFE (CONT'D) Is this the opera house or a--or a French music hall-- ?!
The Wife and her Husband leave the box.
Vronsky is tormented.
He moves to leave the box.
BETSY Yes, why don't you?
BETSY Rescue her and put your seal on the fiasco.
Vronsky knows it and is trapped.
BETSY (CONT'D) Alexei .
BETSY (CONT'D) you see why she must divorce.
BETSY (CONT'D) Marriage will solve everything.
BETSY (CONT'D) When will it be?
VRONSKY As far as I'm concerned, she's my wife.
BETSY But, as you saw, she isn't.
VRONSKY We're going to Moscow, and then to my place in the country.
BETSY That sounds like a good idea.
VRONSKY But for a day or two, Anna will be at home, at my flat.
Betsy shrugs.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Then, I'll say goodbye now.
Angry and upset, Anna sweeps into the flat in her opera cloak.
Vronsky follows her in.
ANNA you had an excellent night!
ANNA Does your mother want you to marry the widow or the child?
VRONSKY Either one.
ANNA Don't make a joke of it.
ANNA If you loved me, you would have locked me in to stop me going.
She throws aside her cloak and goes into the bedroom.
Annushka, asleep in a chair, waiting loyally, wakes up.
ANNA Go to bed.
Vronsky comes in as Annushka goes out.
He comes to Anna and puts his arms round her.
VRONSKY Yes, it was my fault.
ANNA I won't sleep.
VRONSKY I know how to make you sleep.
Vronsky makes love to Anna but it's not working for her.
Her eyes stray around.
By the bed is a carafe of water, an empty glass and a pharmacy bottle as dark as ink, with a handwritten label.
High summer.
Heat and dust.
Anna, with some dainty shopping by her, is taking tea in a genteel cafe.
Her eye is caught by a mother and son at another table.
The boy is a "Serozha."
Anna misses her son acutely in that moment.
Then Dolly enters the tea shop.
Anna's heart lifts for a moment and she is about to greet her, but then realises that Dolly is one of a trio of "society ladies," and Anna lowers her head.
When she sneaks a look, she catches one of the ladies whispering to the others.
Anna realises that she has been recognised by a stranger, and is notorious.
She "hides" in her purse, finding money to leave on the table so that she can escape.
A sound makes her look up and she sees that Dolly has sat down opposite her.
DOLLY Anna .
DOLLY I am very glad to see you.
DOLLY Are you well?
DOLLY How is your little one?
Anna nods, words won't come.
DOLLY (CONT'D) Stiva wanted to invite you and Count Vron- sky to the house but it's impossible .
ANNA I understand.
DOLLY No, no--you don't.
DOLLY Kitty and her husband are with us.
DOLLY She's in Moscow to have the baby.
ANNA Kitty .
ANNA Oh, tell her how pleased I am .
DOLLY Perhaps I'll wait a year or two.
DOLLY Oh .
DOLLY love!
ANNA Yes .
ANNA love!
ANNA Don't you disapprove of me for what I've done?
DOLLY No.
DOLLY I wish I'd done the same.
DOLLY But no one asked me!
DOLLY Well .
DOLLY I wouldn't have been brave enough.
DOLLY Stiva, you know .
DOLLY he doesn't change .
DOLLY like all men, I suppose.
She doesn't notice her tactlessness but it lands on Anna, who manages a smile.
Anna, in a nightdress, is awake in the night, staring out of the grand window of a grand hotel, smoking.
Anna comes back to bed.
Vronsky is asleep.
She unstops a pharmacy bottle (a different one) and pours a draught mixed with water.
Anna sleeps alone in the bed.
Annushka, after a tap on the door, comes in cautiously, worried.
ANNUSHKA Madame .
ANNUSHKA Madame .
Anna sits up.
ANNUSHKA (CONT'D) Are you ill?
ANNA What time is it?
ANNA Is Anya up?
ANNUSHKA It's afternoon, Madame.
ANNA I'm all right.
ANNA It's all right.
ANNA Get them to bring up all our trunks and travel cases.
ANNA We've been here long enough.
Vronsky comes in, noting the empty trunks and cases stacked up.
Anna comes from her room to greet him.
She is making an effort to be pleasant, but she looks excited, febrile.
ANNA I had an inspiration.
ANNA Why do we have to wait here?
ANNA Why can't we wait in the coun- try?
ANNA I don't want to hear any more about a divorce, or think about it.
VRONSKY Good!
VRONSKY I'm bored here.
VRONSKY When should we go?
ANNA If I bore you here, I'll bore you in the country.
VRONSKY I didn't say you bore me.
VRONSKY Moscow bores me.
VRONSKY When should we go?
VRONSKY Tomorrow?
But Anna's mood has turned.
I can't be ready by tomorrow.
The day after, then.
If you like.
No, wait.
That's Sunday.
I have to see Maman.
That's twenty minutes away in the train-- you could go to see her tomorrow--or was it that you wanted to spend Sunday with Princess Sorokina?
Please don't spoil everything.
I can't see Maman tomorrow because she won't have read the papers she has to sign.
Oh, and then there's the bank .
But we can leave on Tuesday.
In that case, let's not bother.
I'll leave on Sunday or not at all.
That's absurd!
ANNA It's absurd to you because you have no understanding for my life here.
VRONSKY Anna .
VRONSKY Anna .
ANNA You've stopped loving me.
ANNA You've given up everything for me, and it's turned you against me.
ANNA Why lie about it?
VRONSKY Stop.
VRONSKY I put off our departure for a day or two, and you tell me I don't love you.
ANNA Because I've been living off your love and there's none left, so this is over!
ANNA Finished.
She leaves him, slamming the door.
Anna comes in and lies down on the bed, closes her eyes, sits up, pours a dose from the medicine bottle by the bed, and lies down.
Vronsky comes in.
He takes her hand.
ANNA I'm sorry.
ANNA I don't mind when we go.
VRONSKY I'll telegraph Maman.
VRONSKY We'll go on Sunday.
VRONSKY I'll do anything you want.
ANNA You should leave me.
VRONSKY I don't want to.
VRONSKY I love you.
ANNA Why?
VRONSKY You can't ask why about love.
Anna comes straight from bed.
She is drugged and shaky.
The room is empty but there is a coffee tray on the table.
Anna feels the coffeepot and pours herself a cup.
Vronsky is at his desk.
Anna enters with her coffee.
Vronsky is reading a telegram.
Seeing her enter, he puts the telegram under his papers.
VRONSKY So--will you be all packed?
VRONSKY I'll be out today making the arrangements.
ANNA Is that your way of telling me you'll be at your mother's with that simpering little princess?
VRONSKY No.
VRONSKY I'll be with my lawyers.
VRONSKY I'm waiting for some documents.
VRONSKY Then I'm having dinner to say goodbye to old comrades.
ANNA Well, I know what that means.
VRONSKY My God, this is unendurable.
He controls himself.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) I can invite them here if you like.
ANNA Thank you, but if I'm not fit to dine in soci- ety, I won't eat with the band.
ANNA Who was the telegram from?
Vronsky retrieves the telegram and hands it to her.
VRONSKY I didn't show it to you, because Stiva keeps telegraphing what we already know.
VRONSKY Kare- nin promises nothing, but will consider .
Anna tosses the telegram aside unread.
ANNA I told you I don't care about the divorce, so why hide the telegram?
ANNA What else do you hide from me?
VRONSKY I hide nothing from you.
ANNA Why do you care about the divorce?
ANNA What has it got to do with us loving each other?
VRONSKY Until we're married, our daughter is legally Karenin's.
VRONSKY I care about it because we need to be free to marry.
ANNA You're perfectly free to marry anyone your mother wants.
VRONSKY But we aren't talking about--
ANNA Yes, we are, and, by the way, compared to your mother I'm the Virgin Mary.
Vronsky is silent with anger.
He gets up and goes out, returning with his hat in his hand.
VRONSKY Is there anything you wish to say to me?
She remains silent.
He leaves again.
She lights a cigarette.
The Sorokina Coach draws up outside the door.
The coach with its crest and the Coachman's livery (a bright yellow cockade) are highly distinctive.
Anna, with her cup of coffee, comes in and looks down from the window.
Vronsky, hat in hand, at the coach window, accepts a large envelope from a lilac-gloved hand.
He bows.
With a wave of the hand and a flash of golden hair, the coach pulls away.
Vronsky goes back inside.
With the envelope, Vronsky comes in.
Anna is as he left her, the cigarette stubbed out.
ANNA So it's the child.
VRONSKY She brought papers from Maman.
He hesitates, thinking she is about to speak.
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Anna?
She stays silent.
He leaves.
Anna finds Annushka filling several half-filled cases.
ANNA Unpack everything.
ANNA We're not going.
She lies down on the bed.
Annushka would like to comfort her.
ANNUSHKA Anna Arkadyeva .
ANNA When Count Vronsky comes back, tell him .
ANNA I don't want to be disturbed.
Anna is listening for Vronsky's return.
She hears him come in.
She hears him approach.
Then she hears Annushka's voice, then Vronsky's voice.
She waits in suspense, disappointed as Vronsky's steps retreat.
Anna, holding a candle-lamp, finds Vronsky asleep on the couch.
She hesi- tates, but turns away.
Anna wakes.
She re-collects herself.
She looks at the bedside clock.
In a sud- den hurry she leaves the bed and the bedroom.
Anna finds Annushka waiting.
ANNA Count Vronsky .
ANNUSHKA He went out early, to the stables, he said.
Anna collapses on a chair and weeps.
ANNA Oh, Annushka .
ANNA I should have died.
ANNA Do you remember?
ANNUSHKA Don't take it to heart, Anna Arkadyeva .
ANNA I've made him hate me.
Anna's hand writes in a hurry: "I'm to blame.
Come home.
I'm frightened."
Anna seals the note and gives it to Annushka.
ANNA Tell Michael to hurry.
Annushka runs out with the note.
Anna is keeping watch at the window .
and is rewarded by the return- ing coach.
She hurries out.
Anna looks down into the entrance hall.
Michael, the Coachman, comes in and comes up the stairs to her.
She sees that he is holding her note.
MICHAEL Count Vronsky had already left, Your Excel- lency.
MICHAEL He took a cab to the station .
MICHAEL to the Countess.
Anna clutches her red bag to her, sitting among passengers.
Anna looks about her.
Across the carriage she sees through the window that her train is overtaking another passenger train on the next line.
She looks at the windows of the other train "going by" .
seeing the pas- sengers inside.
Unexpectedly, she seems to see a Man who might be Vronsky sitting opposite a laughing Woman who might be Princess Sorokina.
Anna's body jerks involuntarily.
She half rises.
The image, however, is brief and is borne away, as her own train goes by, accelerating.
The win- dows opposite pick up speed as she leaves them behind--
And then she has the same illusion again-- a "Vronsky" and a "Sorokina" glimpsed in the other train and snatched away in the instant.
Now she stands up and goes to the opposite window, where the windows of the other train are flashing by in the (anachronistic) manner of pro- jected film-frames, and she sees "Vronskys" and "Sorokinas" flashing by at gathering speed.
And then the train has gone and there's nothing going by but the view.
Anna collapses into the nearest seat.
The train arrives at a small station.
Anna steps down from the train.
The platform is well populated by people waiting to board the train or to meet the arriving passengers.
There is an energy about the people-- shouting, laughter, movement.
Porters shout for custom.
A couple of Young Men seem to be laughing rudely directly at her, but they pass by, ignoring her.
Anna pauses, bewildered, lost, not knowing what to do next.
She sees the Sorokina Coachman on the platform, recognising his distinctive livery, a cockade in his hat.
ANNA Are you waiting for the Princess Sorokina?
COACHMAN No, Your Excellency, both princesses are at the house of Countess Vronsky.
COACHMAN I'm waiting
Anna turns back, agitated, expecting Vronsky to appear, but what comes is a Footman carrying three hatboxes and a large box from a dress shop.
Anna walks away, along the platform, impeded by people going by her, aware that some are staring at her as she passes.
A Boy selling drinks grins at her.
A little group of Ladies and Children meeting a bespectacled man off the train are laughing and chattering but fall silent and look at her.
She increases her pace.
She hurries away towards the far end of the platform.
Beyond her, a goods train is slowly approaching.
Between her and the train, two Maidservants are walking towards her.
They turn their heads to look at her, remarking on her dress.
MAIDSERVANT Look at that lace on her .
There is a rough bench near the end of the platform.
Anna reaches it and sits down.
The two girls turn again to look back at her, and are struck by the sight of Anna sitting alone in profile.
The goods train reaches her and the first wagon goes past her.
The two girls stop and watch, vaguely puzzled by her.
As they watch, the beautiful woman on the bench gets up and walks the few steps to the edge of the wooden platform and into the path of the train, disappearing from view between the wheels of one of the wagons.
--lying separate against a rail, is clipped by a rolling train-wheel and knocked aside, spilling its contents .
A scythe cuts a swathe through standing hay.
It's nearly the last of the hay.
The scythe is being swung by Theodore, known from last year.
He is one of a dozen Mowers.
Levin is among them, wielding his scythe.
They have almost reached the end of the field, where the last of the hay is being pitchforked up on to the last piled cart.
Theodore's daughter-in-law, now visibly pregnant, is still adept with a pitchfork.
It's a lowering thundery day at the end of summer.
LEVIN I'll be buying in feed before winter's over.
THEODORE Well, you don't press people hard, but you live rightly, for your soul, not your belly.
LEVIN My soul!
LEVIN What's that?
LEVIN I know what my belly is.
LEVIN How do we know what's rightly?
LEVIN I believe in reason.
THEODORE Reason?
THEODORE And was it reason that made you chose a wife?
LEVIN No.
THEODORE You're a great one for reasoning, Konstantin Dmitrich, but what's rightly is outside your mathematic--that's what's rightly about it!
This stops Levin's scythe.
He is illumined.
Theodore swings the scythe again.
Levin walks away, gives his scythe to a Labourer by the cart, and keeps walking.
He quickens his pace.
The first drops of rain, few and heavy, arrive.
Cries of alarm and laughter burst from a Mushrooming Party approaching the house.
Children run ahead, the adults walk faster, then run, helping with baby carriages and picking up small children and baskets of mush- rooms .
urged on from the porch by Agafia.
Levin, coming from the hay field, joins the rout.
The grown-ups are: Levin, Oblonsky, Dolly, the Oblonsky Nurse, Prince and Princess Shcherbatsky.
The children are: Tanya, Grisha, Masha, Lili and Vasili.
Dolly carries her youngest.
The children are eighteen months older than when we first saw them.
The heavens open as everyone gets under cover.
LEVIN Where's Ekaterina Alexandrovna?
AGAFIA It's all right, the mistress is giving Mitya his bath.
It is evident from her tone that Kitty and Agafia have made it up long ago.
Rain on the window and on the roof.
The rain is so loud that it is the foreground sound in the scene; and the dialogue, while we can pick it out without difficulty, is the background sound.
Levin enters, wet.
Dmitri (Mitya), two months old, is lying on his back in a basin, supported by Kitty's palm under his head.
Kitty squeezes a sponge over his body, which he likes.
LEVIN I came looking for you .
LEVIN I understood something .
KITTY And what was that?
Kitty lifts Mitya onto a towel on her lap, wraps him and gives him to Levin, who is enchanted by him.
LEVIN He smiled at me.
KITTY He's very advanced for his age.
She picks up her rings to replace them on her fingers.
KITTY (CONT'D) What did you understand?
But the baby starts to yell for the breast.
Kitty starts to undo her blouse.
Levin shakes his head: he'll tell her some other time, or maybe not.
The storm has passed.
Everything drips.
Oblonsky comes from inside and lights a cigar.
Indistinctly seen and heard through the window, the Mushrooming Party occupies the dining room.
Oblonsky smokes thoughtfully, melancholy.
Baby Anya, old enough to stagger on her feet, wavers through wild flowers half her height.
She falls over, almost disappearing.
This is being watched, with a mixture more pleasure than pain, by Kar- enin.
He is in early retirement, sitting with a book in a garden seat, dressed comfortably under a straw hat.
There is the SOUND OVER of people playing croquet.
Serozha, aged ten, enters his view, going to Anya to haul her upright, and keeping hold of her hand as she staggers on.
Karenin's pleasure increases slightly.
OVER this, the growing SOUND of a battlefield.
Vronsky, in an unfamiliar uniform, sabre pointing forward, is mounted at full gallop with the SOUND of the charge all around him in the smoke and noise of guns.
Something heavy and invisible with its own SOUND--like the flap of an awning--takes him from his horse into the air and gone, leaving spouts of blood poised for an instant in the smoke.
Serozha picks up Anya like a parcel under his arm and walks on with her towards the indistinct figures of Croquet Players strolling in the heat haze, a couple of parasols held aloft.
