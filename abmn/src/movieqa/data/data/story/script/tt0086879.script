"AMADEUS"
by
Peter Shaffer
Final Draft
Total darkness.
We hear an old man's voice, distinct and in distress.
It is OLD SALIERI.
He uses a mixture of English and occasionally Italian.
OLD SALIERI Mozart!
OLD SALIERI Mozart!
OLD SALIERI Mozart.
OLD SALIERI Forgive me!
OLD SALIERI Forgive your assassin!
OLD SALIERI Mozart!
A faint light illuminates the screen.
Flickeringly, we see an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs.
We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing.
Up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by Salieri's VALET.
By his side is Salieri's COOK, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits.
Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian.
It is very cold.
They wear shawls over their night-dresses and clogs on their feet.
They wheeze as they climb.
The candles throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, which is evidently an old one and in bad decay.
A cat scuttles swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon door.
The Valet tries the handle.
It is locked.
Behind it the voice goes on, rising in volume.
OLD SALIERI Show some mercy!
OLD SALIERI I beg you.
OLD SALIERI I beg you!
OLD SALIERI Show mercy to a guilty man!
The Valet knocks gently on the door.
The voice stops.
VALET Open the door, Signore!
VALET Please!
VALET Be good now!
VALET We've brought you something special.
VALET Something you're going to love.
Silence.
VALET Signore Salieri!
VALET Open the door.
VALET Come now.
VALET Be good!
The voice of Old Salieri continues again, further off now, and louder.
We hear a noise as if a window is being opened.
OLD SALIERI Mozart!
OLD SALIERI Mozart!
OLD SALIERI I confess it!
OLD SALIERI Listen!
OLD SALIERI I confess!
The two servants look at each other in alarm.
Then the Valet hands the candlestick to the Cook and takes a sugared cake from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the stairs.
The street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers, five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing couples and a sled and three dogs.
It is a windy night.
Snow is falling and whirling about.
People are passing on foot, holding their cloaks tightly around them.
Some of them are revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties.
Now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house.
The window above the street is open and Old Salieri stands there calling to the sky: a sharp-featured, white-haired Italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing gown.
OLD SALIERI Mozart!
OLD SALIERI Mozart!
OLD SALIERI I cannot bear it any longer!
OLD SALIERI I confess!
OLD SALIERI I confess what I did!
OLD SALIERI I'm guilty!
OLD SALIERI I killed you!
OLD SALIERI Sir I confess!
OLD SALIERI I killed you!
The door of the house bursts open.
The Valet hobbles out, holding the sugared cake.
The wind catches at his shawl.
OLD SALIERI Mozart, perdonami!
OLD SALIERI Forgive your assassin!
OLD SALIERI Piet?!
OLD SALIERI Piet?!
OLD SALIERI Forgive your assassin!
OLD SALIERI Forgive me!
OLD SALIERI Forgive!
OLD SALIERI Forgive!
VALET That's all right, Signore!
VALET He heard you!
VALET He forgave you!
VALET He wants you to go inside now and shut the window!
Old Salieri stares down at him.
Some of the passersby have now stopped and are watching this spectacle.
VALET Come on, Signore!
VALET Look what I have for you!
VALET I can't give it to you from down here, can I?
Old Salieri looks at him in contempt.
Then he turns away back into the room, shutting the window with a bang.
Through the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers in the street.
They stare back at him in confusion.
BYSTANDER Who is that?
VALET No one, sir.
VALET He'll be all right.
VALET Poor man.
VALET He's a little unhappy, you know.
He makes a sign indicating 'crazy,' and goes back inside the house.
The onlookers keep staring.
The Cook is standing holding the candlestick in one hand, the dish of cakes in the other.
The Valet arrives, panting.
VALET Did he open?
The Cook, scared, shakes his head: no.
The Valet again knocks on the door.
VALET Here I am, Signore.
VALET Now open the door.
He eats the sugared cake in his hand, elaborately and noisily.
VALET Mmmm - this is good!
VALET This is the most delicious thing I ever ate, believe me!
VALET Signore, you don't know what you're missing!
VALET Mmmm!
We hear a thump from inside the bedroom.
VALET Now that's enough, Signore!
VALET Open!
We hear a terrible, throaty groaning.
VALET If you don't open this door, we're going to eat everything.
VALET There'll be nothing left for you.
VALET And I'm not going to bring you anything more.
He looks down.
From under the door we see a trickle of blood flowing.
In horror, the two men stare at it.
The dish of cakes falls from the Cook's hand and shatters.
He sets the candlestick down on the floor.
Both servants run at the door frantically - once, twice, three times - and the frail lock gives.
The door flies open.
Immediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of Mozart's Symphony No.
25 (the Little G Minor) begins.
We see what the servants see.
Old Salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand.
He has cut his throat but is still alive.
He gestures at them.
They run to him.
Barely, we glimpse the room - an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte- piano, a chamber-pot on the floor - as the Valet and the Cook struggle to lift their old Master, and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin.
Twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, full orchestra.
As the music slows a little, we see a Masquerade Ball in progress.
A crowded room of dancers is executing the slow portion of a dance fashionable in the early 1820's.
As the fast music returns, we see Old Salieri being carried out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants, and placed in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle- aged doctor in a tall hat.
This is DOCTOR GULDEN.
He gets in beside his patient.
The driver whips up the horse, and the wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow.
The wagon is galloping through the snowy streets of the city.
Inside the conveyance we see Old Salieri wrapped in blankets, half-conscious, being held by the hospital attendants.
Doctor Gulden stares at him grimly.
The wagon arrives outside the General Hospital of Vienna.
A wide, white-washed corridor.
Doctor Gulden is walking down it with a priest, a man of about forty, concerned, but somewhat self-important.
This is Father VOGLER, Chaplain at the hospital.
In the corridor as they walk, we note several patients -- some of them visibly disturbed mentally.
All patients wear white linen smocks.
Doctor Gulden wears a dark frock-coat; Vogler, a cassock.
DOCTOR GULDEN He's going to live.
DOCTOR GULDEN It's much harder to cut your throat than most people imagine.
They stop outside a door.
DOCTOR GULDEN Here we are.
DOCTOR GULDEN Do you wish me to come in with you?
VOGLER No, Doctor.
VOGLER Thank you.
Vogler nods and opens the door.
A bare room - one of the best available in the General Hospital.
It contains a bed, a table with candles, chairs, a small forte-piano of the early nineteenth century.
As Vogler enters, Old Salieri is sitting in a wheel-chair, looking out the window.
His back is to us.
The priest closes the door quietly behind him.
VOGLER Herr Salieri?
Old Salieri turns around to look at him.
We see that his throat is bandaged expertly.
He wears hospital garb, and over it the Civilian Medal and Chain with which we will later see the EMPEROR invest him.
OLD SALIERI What do you want?
VOGLER I am Father Vogler.
VOGLER I am a Chaplain here.
VOGLER I thought you might like to talk to someone.
OLD SALIERI About what?
VOGLER You tried to take your life.
VOGLER You do remember that, don't you?
OLD SALIERI So?
VOGLER In the sight of God that is a sin.
OLD SALIERI What do you want?
VOGLER Do you understand that you have sinned?
VOGLER Gravely.
OLD SALIERI Leave me alone.
VOGLER I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
OLD SALIERI Do you know who I am?
OLD SALIERI You never heard of me, did you?
VOGLER That makes no difference.
VOGLER All men are equal in God's eyes.
OLD SALIERI Are they?
VOGLER Offer me your confession.
VOGLER I can offer you God's forgiveness.
OLD SALIERI I do not seek forgiveness.
VOGLER My son, there is something dreadful on your soul.
VOGLER Unburden it to me.
VOGLER I'm here only for you.
VOGLER Please talk to me.
OLD SALIERI How well are you trained in music?
VOGLER I know a little.
VOGLER I studied it in my youth.
OLD SALIERI Where?
VOGLER Here in Vienna.
OLD SALIERI Then you must know this.
He propels his wheelchair to the forte-piano, and plays an unrecognizable melody.
VOGLER I can't say I do.
VOGLER What is it?
OLD SALIERI I'm surprised you don't know.
OLD SALIERI It was a very popular tune in its day.
OLD SALIERI I wrote it.
OLD SALIERI How about this?
He plays another tune.
OLD SALIERI This one brought down the house when we played it first.
He plays it with growing enthusiasm.
We see the pretty soprano KATHERINA CAVALIERI, now about twenty-four, dressed in an elaborate mythological Persian costume, singing on stage.
She's near the end of a very florid aria by Salieri.
The audience applauds wildly.
OLD SALIERI Well?
VOGLER I regret it is not too familiar.
OLD SALIERI Can you recall no melody of mine?
OLD SALIERI I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy.
OLD SALIERI I wrote forty operas alone.
OLD SALIERI What about this little thing?
Slyly he plays the opening measure of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.
The priest nods, smiling suddenly, and hums a little with the music.
VOGLER Oh, I know that!
VOGLER That's charming!
VOGLER I didn't know you wrote that.
OLD SALIERI I didn't.
OLD SALIERI That was Mozart.
OLD SALIERI Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
OLD SALIERI You know who that is?
VOGLER Of course.
VOGLER The man you accuse yourself of killing.
OLD SALIERI Ah - you've heard that?
VOGLER All Vienna has heard that.
OLD SALIERI And do they believe it?
VOGLER Is it true?
OLD SALIERI Do you believe it?
VOGLER Should I?
A very long pause.
Salieri stares above the priest, seemingly lost in his own private world.
VOGLER For God's sake, my son, if you have anything to confess, do it now!
VOGLER Give yourself some peace!
A further pause.
VOGLER Do you hear me?
OLD SALIERI He was murdered, Father!
OLD SALIERI Mozart!
OLD SALIERI Cruelly murdered.
Pause.
VOGLER Yes?
VOGLER Did you do it?
Suddenly Old Salieri turns to him, a look of extreme innocence.
OLD SALIERI He was my idol!
OLD SALIERI I can't remember a time when I didn't know his name!
OLD SALIERI When I was only fourteen he was already famous.
OLD SALIERI Even in Legnago - the tiniest town in Italy - I knew of him.
There are twelve children and twenty adults in the square.
We see the fourteen-year-old Salieri blindfolded, playing a game of Blindman's Bluff with other Italian children, running about in the bright sunshine and laughing.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) I was still playing childish games when he was playing music for kings and emperors.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Even the Pope in Rome!
We see the six-year-old MOZART, also blindfolded, seated in a gilded chair on a pile of books, playing the harpsichord for the POPE and a suite of CARDINALS and other churchmen.
Beside the little boy stands LEOPOLD, his father, smirking with pride.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) I admit I was jealous when I heard the tales they told about him.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Not of the brilliant little prodigy himself, but of his father, who had taught him everything.
The piece finishes.
Leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord and lifts up his little son to stand on it.
Mozart removes the blindfold to show a pale little face with staring eyes.
Both father and son bow.
A Papal Chamberlain presents Leopold with a gold snuff box whilst the cardinals decorously applaud.
Over this scene Old Salieri speaks.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) My father did not care for music.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) He wanted me only to be a merchant, like himself.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) As anonymous as he was.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) When I told how I wished I could be like Mozart, he would say, Why?
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Do you want to be a trained monkey?
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Would you like me to drag you around Europe doing tricks like a circus freak?
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) How could I tell him what music meant to me?
Serene music of the Italian Baroque - Pergolesi's Stabat Mater - sung by a choir of boys with organ accompaniment.
We see the outside of the 17th-century church sitting in the wide landscape of Lombardy: sunlit fields, a dusty, white road, poplar trees.
The music continues and swells.
We see the twelve-year-old Salieri seated between his plump and placid parents in the congregation, listening in rapture.
His father is a heavy- looking, self-approving man, obviously indifferent to the music.
A large and austere Christ on the cross hangs over the altar.
Candles burn below his image.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Even then a spray of sounded notes could make me dizzy, almost to falling.
The boy falls forward on his knees.
So do his parents and the other members of the congregation.
He stares up at Christ who stares back at him.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Whilst my father prayed earnestly to God to protect commerce, I would offer up secretly the proudest prayer a boy could think of.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Lord, make me a great composer!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Let me celebrate your glory through music - and be celebrated myself!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Make me famous through the world, dear God!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Make me immortal!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) After I die let people speak my name forever with love for what I wrote!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) In return I vow I will give you my chastity - my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) And I will help my fellow man all I can.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Amen and amen!
The music swells to a crescendo.
The candles flare.
We see the Christ through the flames looking at the boy benignly.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) And do you know what happened?
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) A miracle!
CU, a large cooked fish on a thick china plate.
Camera pulls back to show the Salieri family at dinner.
Father Salieri sits at the head of the table, a napkin tucked into his chin.
Mother Salieri is serving the fish into portions and handing them round.
Two maiden aunts are in attendance, wearing black, and of course the young boy.
Father Salieri receives his plate of fish and starts to eat greedily.
Suddenly there is a gasp - he starts to choke violently on a fish bone.
All the women get up and crowd around him, thumping and pummeling him, but it is in vain.
Father Salieri collapses.
OLD SALIERI Suddenly he was dead.
OLD SALIERI Just like that!
OLD SALIERI And my life changed forever.
OLD SALIERI My mother said, Go.
OLD SALIERI Study music if you really want to.
OLD SALIERI Off with you!
OLD SALIERI And off I went as quick as I could and never saw Italy again.
OLD SALIERI Of course, I knew God had arranged it all; that was obvious.
OLD SALIERI One moment I was a frustrated boy in an obscure little town.
OLD SALIERI The next I was here, in Vienna, city of musicians, sixteen years old and studying under Gluck!
OLD SALIERI Gluck, Father.
OLD SALIERI Do you know who he was?
OLD SALIERI The greatest composer of his time.
OLD SALIERI And he loved me!
OLD SALIERI That was the wonder.
OLD SALIERI He taught me everything he knew.
OLD SALIERI And when I was ready, introduced me personally to the Emperor!
OLD SALIERI Emperor Joseph - the musical king!
OLD SALIERI Within a few years I was his court composer.
OLD SALIERI Wasn't that incredible?
OLD SALIERI Imperial Composer to His Majesty!
OLD SALIERI Actually the man had no ear at all, but what did it matter?
OLD SALIERI He adored my music, that was enough.
OLD SALIERI Night after night I sat right next to the Emperor of Austria, playing duets with him, correcting the royal sight-reading.
OLD SALIERI Tell me, if you had been me, wouldn't you have thought God had accepted your vow?
OLD SALIERI And believe me, I honoured it.
OLD SALIERI I was a model of virtue.
OLD SALIERI I kept my hands off women, worked hours every day teaching students, many of them for free, sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians - work and work and work, that was all my life.
OLD SALIERI And it was wonderful!
OLD SALIERI Everybody liked me.
OLD SALIERI I liked myself.
OLD SALIERI I was the most successful musician in Vienna.
OLD SALIERI And the happiest.
OLD SALIERI Till he came.
OLD SALIERI Mozart.
A grand room crowded with guests.
A small group of Gypsy musicians is playing in the background.
Thirteen members of the Archbishop's orchestra - all wind players, complete with 18th-century wind instruments: elaborate-looking bassoons, basset horns, etc.
and wearing their employer's livery - are laying out music on stands at one end of the room.
At the other end is a large gilded chair, bearing the arms of the ARCHBISHOP OF SALZBURG.
A throng of people is standing, talking, and preparing to sit upon the rows of waiting chairs to hear a concert.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) One day he came to Vienna to play some of his music at the residence of his employer, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Eagerly I went there to seek him out.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) That night changed my life.
We see Salieri, age thirty-one, a neat, carefully turned-cut man in decent black clothes and clean white linen, walking through the crowd of guests.
We follow him.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) As I went through the salon, I played a game with myself.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) This man had written his first concerto at the age of four; his first symphony at seven; a full-scale opera at twelve.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Did it show?
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Is talent like that written on the face?
We see shots of assorted young men staring back at Salieri as he moves through the crowd.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Which one of them could he be?
Some of the men recognize Salieri and bow respectfully.
Then suddenly a servant bearing a large tray of cakes and pastries stalks past.
Instantly riveted by the sight of such delights, Salieri follows him out of the Grand Salon.
The servant marches along bearing his tray of pastries aloft.
Salieri follows him.
The servant turns into:
Salieri's POV: several tables, dressed to the floor with cloths are loaded with many plates of confectionery.
It is, in fact, Salieri's idea of paradise!
The servant puts his tray down on one of the tables and withdraws from the room.
Salieri turns away so as not to be noticed by the servant.
As soon as the man disappears, Salieri sneaks into the buffet room.
Salieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously.
He is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of sweet things.
His attention is attracted in particular by a huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a pineapple.
He reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls, but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him.
He ducks down behind the pastry table.
A girl - CONSTANZE - rushes into the room.
She runs straight across it and hides herself behind one of the tables.
After a beat of total silence, MOZART runs into the room, stops, and looks around.
He is age twenty-six, wearing a fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the Archbishop of Salzburg upon it.
He is puzzled; Constanze has disappeared.
Baffled, he turns and is about to leave the room, when Constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny mouse.
Instantly Mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling across the floor, meowing and hissing like a naughty cat.
Watched by an astonished Salieri, Mozart disappears under the cloth and obviously pounces upon Constanze.
We hear a high-pitched giggle, which is going to characterize Mozart throughout the film.
The throng is mostly seated.
The musicians are in their places, holding their various exotic-looking wind instruments; the candles are all lit.
A Majordomo appears and bangs his staff on the floor for attention.
Immediately COLLOREDO, Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg enters.
He is a small self- important figure of fifty in a wig, surmounted by a scarlet skullcap.
He is followed by his Chamberlain, the Count ARCO.
Everyone stands.
The Archbishop goes to his throne and sits.
His guests sit also.
Arco gives the signal to start the music.
Nothing happens.
Instead, a wind musician gets up, approaches the Chamberlain and whispers in his ear.
Arco in turn whispers to the Archbishop.
ARCO Mozart is not here.
COLLOREDO Where is he?
ARCO They're looking for him, Your Grace.
Three servants are opening doors and looking into rooms going off the corridor.
The guests are turning around and looking at the Archbishop.
The musicians are watching.
There is puzzlement and a murmur of comment.
The Archbishop tightens his lip.
COLLOREDO We'll start without him.
Mozart is on his knees before the tablecloth, which reaches to the floor.
Under it is Constanze.
We hear her giggling as he talks.
MOZART Miaouw!
MOZART Miaouw!
MOZART Mouse-wouse?
MOZART It's Puss-wuss, fangs-wangs.
MOZART Paws-claws.
MOZART Pounce-bounce!
He grabs her ankle.
She screams.
He pulls her out by her leg.
CONSTANZE Stop it.
CONSTANZE Stop it!
They roll on the floor.
He tickles her.
CONSTANZE Stop it!
MOZART I am!
MOZART I am!
MOZART I'm stopping it - slowly.
MOZART You see!
MOZART Look, I've stopped.
MOZART Now we are going back.
He tries to drag her back under the table.
CONSTANZE No!
CONSTANZE No!
CONSTANZE No!
MOZART Yes!
MOZART Back!
MOZART Back!
MOZART Listen - don't you know where you are?
CONSTANZE Where?
MOZART We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
CONSTANZE Fartsbishop!
She laughs delightedly, then addresses an imaginary Archbishop.
CONSTANZE Your Grace, I've got something to tell you.
CONSTANZE I want to complain about this man.
MOZART Go ahead, tell him.
MOZART Tell them all.
MOZART They won't understand you anyway.
CONSTANZE Why not?
MOZART Because here everything goes backwards.
MOZART People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
CONSTANZE That's stupid.
MOZART Why?
MOZART People fart backwards.
CONSTANZE Do you think that's funny?
MOZART Yes, I think it's brilliant.
MOZART You've been doing it for years.
He gives a high pitched giggle.
CONSTANZE Oh, ha, ha, ha.
MOZART Sra-I'm-sick!
MOZART Sra-I'm sick!
CONSTANZE Yes, you are.
CONSTANZE You're very sick.
MOZART No, no.
MOZART Say it backwards, shit-wit.
MOZART Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
CONSTANZE Sra-I'm-sick.
CONSTANZE Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my!
CONSTANZE Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
MOZART Em iram!
MOZART Em iram!
CONSTANZE No, I'm not playing this game.
MOZART No, this is serious.
MOZART Say it backwards.
CONSTANZE No!
MOZART Just say it - you'll see.
MOZART It's very serious.
MOZART Em iram!
MOZART Em iram!
CONSTANZE Iram - marry Em - marry me!
CONSTANZE No, no!
CONSTANZE You're a fiend.
CONSTANZE I'm not going to marry a fiend.
CONSTANZE A dirty fiend at that.
MOZART Ui-vol-i-tub!
CONSTANZE Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You.
CONSTANZE I love you!
The mood becomes suddenly softer.
She kisses him.
They embrace.
Then he spoils it.
MOZART Tish-I'm tee.
MOZART What's that?
CONSTANZE What?
MOZART Tish-I'm-tee.
CONSTANZE Eat
MOZART Yes.
CONSTANZE Eat my - ah!
Shocked, she strikes at him.
At the same moment the music starts in the salon next door.
We hear the opening of the Serenade for Thirteen Wind Instruments, K.
MOZART My music!
MOZART They've started!
MOZART They've started without me!
He leaps up, disheveled and rumpled and runs out of the room.
Salieri watches in amazement and disgust.
The music is louder.
Mozart hastens towards the Grand Salon away from the buffet room, adjusting his dress as he goes.
The opening of the Serenade is being tentatively conducted by the leader of the wind-musicians.
Guests turn around as Mozart appears - bowing to the Archbishop - and walks with an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is playing.
The leader yields his place to the composer and Mozart smoothly takes over conducting.
Constanze, deeply embarrassed, sneaks into the room and seats herself at the back.
The music fades down.
Salieri stands shocked from his inadvertent eavesdropping.
After a second he moves almost in a trance toward the door; the music dissolves.
Mozart is conducting the Adagio from his Serenade (K.
361), guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists.
The squeezebox opening of the movement begins.
Salieri appears at the door at the back of the salon.
He stares in disbelief at Mozart.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) So that was he!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) That giggling, dirty- minded creature I'd just seen crawling on the floor.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Mozart.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) The phenomenon whose legend had haunted my youth.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Impossible.
The music swells up and Salieri listens to it with eyes closed - amazed, transported - suddenly engulfed by the sound.
Finally it fades down and away and changes into applause.
Salieri opens his eyes.
The audience is clearly delighted.
Mozart bows to them, also delighted.
Colloredo rises abruptly, and without looking at Mozart or applauding and leaves the Salon.
Count Arco approaches the composer.
Mozart turns to him, radiant.
ARCO Follow me, please.
ARCO The Archbishop would like a word.
MOZART Certainly!
He follows Arco out of the room, through a throng of admirers.
Mozart and Arco walk side by side.
They pass Salieri who is staring at Mozart in fascination.
As they disappear, he steals toward the music stands, unable to help himself.
MOZART Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
ARCO Indeed.
MOZART These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
ARCO His Grace is very angry with you.
MOZART What do you mean?
They arrive at the door of Colloredo's private apartment.
ARCO You are to come in here and ask his pardon.
Arco opens the door.
The Archbishop is sitting, chatting to quests.
Among them are several ladies.
Arco approaches him obsequiously.
ARCO Your Grace.
COLLOREDO Ah, Mozart.
COLLOREDO Why?
MOZART Why what, sir?
COLLOREDO Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
MOZART Humiliated?
COLLOREDO How much provocation am I to endure from you?
COLLOREDO The more license I allow you, the more you take.
The company watches this scene, deeply interested.
MOZART If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
COLLOREDO I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg.
COLLOREDO Your father is waiting for you there patiently.
COLLOREDO I will speak to you further when I come.
MOZART No, Your Grace!
MOZART I mean with all humility, no.
MOZART I would rather you dismissed me.
MOZART It's obvious I don't satisfy.
COLLOREDO Then try harder, Mozart.
COLLOREDO I have no intention of dismissing you.
COLLOREDO You will remain in my service and learn your place.
COLLOREDO Go now.
He extends his hand to be kissed.
Mozart does it with a furious grace, then leaves the room.
As he opens the door we see:
A group of people who have attended the concert, among them Constanze, are standing outside the private apartment.
At sight of the composer they break into sustained applause.
Mozart is suddenly delighted.
He throws the door wide open
so that the guests can see into the private apartment where the Archbishop sits - and he can see them.
Colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee.
He smiles and bows uneasily, as they include him in the small ovation.
Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause for the Archbishop with conducting gestures.
Suddenly irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and shuts the door, ending the applause.
Salieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the full score of the Serenade.
He turns the pages back to the slow movement.
Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains.
CU, Salieri, reading the score of the Adagio in helpless fascination.
The music is played against his description of it.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Extraordinary!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) On the page it looked nothing.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) The beginning simple, almost comic.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Just a pulse - bassoons and basset horns - like a rusty squeezebox.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Then suddenly - high above it - an oboe, a single note, hanging there unwavering, till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) This was no composition by a performing monkey!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) This was a music I'd never heard.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) It seemed to me that I was hearing a voice of God.
Suddenly the music snaps off.
Mozart stands before him as he lays down the score.
MOZART Excuse me!
He takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room.
Salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little figure.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) But why?
OLD SALIERI Why?
OLD SALIERI Would God choose an obscene child to be His instrument?
OLD SALIERI It was not to be believed!
OLD SALIERI This piece had to be an accident.
OLD SALIERI It had to be!
At the table sits the EMPEROR JOSEPH II, eating his frugal dinner and sipping goat's milk.
He is an intelligent, dapper man of forty, wearing a military uniform.
Around him but standing, are his Chamberlain, JOHANN VON STRACK: stiff and highly correct.
COUNT ORSINI-ROSENBERG: a corpulent man of sixty, highly conscious of his position as Director of the Opera.
BARON VON SWIETEN, the Imperial Librarian: a grave but kindly and educated man in his mid-fifties.
FIRST KAPELLMEISTER GIUSEPPE BONNO: very Italian, cringing and time-serving, aged about seventy.
And Salieri, wearing decorous black, as usual.
At a side-table, two Imperial secretaries, using quill pens and inkstands, write down everything of importance that is said.
JOSEPH How good is he, this Mozart?
VON SWIETEN He's remarkable, Majesty.
VON SWIETEN I heard an extraordinary serious opera of his last month.
VON SWIETEN Idomeneo, King of Crete.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG That?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG A most tiresome piece.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG I heard it, too.
VON SWIETEN Tiresome?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Too much spice.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Too many notes.
VON SWIETEN Majesty, I thought it the most promising work I've heard in years.
JOSEPH Ah-ha.
JOSEPH Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him.
JOSEPH We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
VON STRACK I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible.
VON STRACK The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
JOSEPH Very small pay, I imagine.
JOSEPH I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer.
JOSEPH Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
VON SWIETEN Excellent, sire!
ORSINI-ROSENBERG But not German, I beg your Majesty!
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Italian is the proper language for opera.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG All educated people agree on that.
JOSEPH Ah-ha.
JOSEPH What do you say, Chamberlain?
VON STRACK In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir.
VON STRACK Plain German.
VON STRACK For plain people.
He looks defiantly at Orsini-Rosenberg.
JOSEPH Ah-ha.
JOSEPH Kapellmeister?
BONNO Majesty, I must agree with Herr Dirretore.
BONNO Opera is an Italian art, solamente.
BONNO German is - scusate - too bruta for singing, too rough.
JOSEPH Ah-ha.
JOSEPH Court Composer, what do you say?
SALIERI I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty.
SALIERI It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
JOSEPH You are cattivo, Court Composer.
JOSEPH I want to meet this young man.
JOSEPH Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
VON STRACK Yes, sir.
JOSEPH Well.
JOSEPH There it is.
A somber room which serves both as a bedroom and a study.
We see a four-poster bed.
Also, a marble mantelpiece above which hangs a handsome cross in olivewood, bearing the figure of a severe Christ.
Opposite this image sits Salieri at his desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens and ink.
On one side of him is an open forte-piano on which he occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing, with some difficulty.
He scratches notes out with his quill, and ruffles his hair - which we see without a powdered wig.
There is a knock at the door.
SALIERI Si.
A servant admits LORL, a young lower-class girl, who appears carrying a basket in which is a box covered with a napkin.
She has just come from the baker's shop.
SALIERI Ah!
SALIERI Here she comes.
SALIERI Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
LORL Good morning, sir.
SALIERI What have you got for me today?
SALIERI Let me see.
Greedily he unwraps the napkin and lifts the lid on the box.
SALIERI Ah-ha!
SALIERI Siena macaroons - my favourites.
SALIERI Give my best thanks to the baker.
LORL I will, sir.
He takes a biscuit and eats.
SALIERI Thank you.
SALIERI Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
LORL Yes, thank you, sir.
SALIERI Bene!
SALIERI Bene!
She gives a little curtsey, flattered and giggling and is shown out.
Salieri turns back to his work, chewing.
He plays through a complete line of the march.
He smiles, pleased with the result.
SALIERI Grazie, Signore.
He inclines his head to the Christ above the fireplace, and starts to play the whole march, including the phrase which pleased him.
The march continues on the forte-piano as we see Mozart, seated in front of a mirror, wearing an extravagant wig.
On either side of him stands a SALESMAN, one of them holding another wig, equally extravagant.
Mozart takes off the first wig, to reveal his own blonde hair, of which he is extremely proud, and hands it back.
MOZART And the other one?
The Salesman puts the second wig on his head.
Mozart pulls a face of doubt in the mirror.
MOZART And the other one?
He takes it off and the other Salesman replaces it with the first wig on his head.
MOZART Oh, they're both so beautiful, I can't decide.
MOZART Why don't I have two heads?
He giggles.
The music stops.
A door opens.
We glimpse in the next room the Emperor Joseph bidding goodbye to a group of military officers standing around a table.
JOSEPH Good, good, good.
He turns and comes into the salon, where another group awaits him.
It consists of Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, Von Swieten and Salieri.
The room contains several gilded chairs dotted about, and a forte-piano.
JOSEPH Good morning, gentlemen.
All bow and say, Good morning, Your Majesty!
JOSEPH Well, what do you have for me today?
VON STRACK Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
JOSEPH Yes, what about him?
VON STRACK He's here.
JOSEPH Ah-ha.
JOSEPH Well.
JOSEPH There it is.
JOSEPH Good.
SALIERI Majesty, I hope you won't think it improper, but I have written a little March of Welcome in his honour.
He produces a paper.
JOSEPH What a charming idea.
JOSEPH May I see?
SALIERI It's just a trifle, of course.
JOSEPH May I try it?
SALIERI Majesty.
The Emperor goes to the instrument, sits and plays the first bars of it.
Quite well.
JOSEPH Delightful, Court Composer.
JOSEPH Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
SALIERI You do me too much honour, Sire.
JOSEPH Let's have some fun.
JOSEPH Bring in Herr Mozart, please.
JOSEPH But slowly, slowly.
JOSEPH I need a minute to practice.
The Majordomo bows and goes.
The Emperor addresses himself to the march.
He plays a wrong note.
SALIERI A-flat, Majesty.
JOSEPH Ah-ha!
Taking his instructions literally, the Majordomo is marching very slowly toward the salon door.
He is followed by a bewildered Mozart, dressed very stylishly and wearing one of the wigs from the perruqier.
Joseph finishes the march.
The door opens.
MAJORDOMO Herr Mozart.
Mozart comes in eagerly.
Immediately the march begins, played by His Majesty.
All the courtiers stand, listening with admiration.
Joseph plays well, but applies himself fiercely to the manuscript.
Mozart, still bewildered, regards the scene, but does not seem to pay attention to the music itself.
It finishes and all clap obsequiously.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Bravo, Your Majesty!
VON STRACK Well done, Sire!
The Emperor rises, pleased with himself.
He snatches the manuscript off the stand and holds it in his hand for the rest of the scene.
JOSEPH Gentlemen, gentlemen, a little less enthusiasm, I beg you.
JOSEPH Ah, Mozart.
He extends his hand.
Mozart throws himself to his knees, and to Joseph's discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour.
MOZART Your Majesty!
JOSEPH No, no, please!
JOSEPH It is not a holy relic.
JOSEPH You know we have met already?
JOSEPH In this very room.
JOSEPH Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.
JOSEPH He was giving the most brilliant little concert here.
JOSEPH As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell.
JOSEPH My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did?
JOSEPH Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Embarrassed, Mozart bursts into a wild giggle.
Joseph helps him out.
JOSEPH You know all these gentlemen, I'm sure.
Von Strack and Bonno nod.
JOSEPH The Baron Von Swieten.
VON SWIETEN I'm a great admirer of yours, young man.
VON SWIETEN Welcome.
MOZART Oh, thank you.
JOSEPH The Director of our Opera.
JOSEPH Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
MOZART Oh sir, yes!
MOZART The honour is mine.
MOZART Absolutely.
Orsini-Rosenberg nods without enthusiasm.
JOSEPH And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
SALIERI Finally!
SALIERI Such an immense joy.
SALIERI Diletto straordinario!
MOZART I know your work well, Signore.
MOZART Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
SALIERI Really?
MOZART Mio caro Adone.
SALIERI Ah!
MOZART A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
JOSEPH And now he has returned the compliment.
JOSEPH Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
MOZART Really?
MOZART Oh, grazie, Signore!
MOZART Sono commosso!
MOZART E un onore per mo eccezionale.
MOZART Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
He bows elaborately.
Salieri inclines himself, dryly.
SALIERI My pleasure.
JOSEPH Well, there it is.
JOSEPH Now to business.
JOSEPH Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you.
JOSEPH What do you say?
MOZART Majesty!
JOSEPH Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
VON STRACK Did we?
VON SWIETEN I don't think it was really decided, Director.
MOZART Oh, German!
MOZART German!
MOZART Please let it be German.
JOSEPH Why so?
MOZART Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Oh?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Have I seen it?
MOZART I - I don't think you have, Herr Director.
MOZART Not yet.
MOZART I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG I think you'd better.
JOSEPH Well, what is it about?
JOSEPH Tell us the story.
MOZART It's actually quite amusing, Majesty.
MOZART It's set - the whole thing is set in a - in a -
He stops short with a little giggle.
JOSEPH Yes, where?
MOZART In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty.
MOZART A Seraglio.
JOSEPH Ah-ha.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG You mean in Turkey?
MOZART Exactly.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Then why especially does it have to be in German?
MOZART Well not especially.
MOZART It can be in Turkish, if you really want.
MOZART I don't care.
He giggles again.
Orsini-Rosenberg looks at him sourly.
VON SWIETEN My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point.
VON SWIETEN Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
MOZART Why not?
MOZART It's charming.
MOZART I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their!
MOZART their!
MOZART It's not indecent!
MOZART It's highly moral, Majesty.
MOZART It's full of proper German virtues.
MOZART I swear it.
MOZART Absolutely!
JOSEPH Well, I'm glad to hear that.
SALIERI Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be?
SALIERI Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
JOSEPH Cattivo again, Court Composer.
JOSEPH Well, tell him, Mozart.
JOSEPH Name us a German virtue.
MOZART Love, Sire!
SALIERI Ah, love!
SALIERI Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
The Italian faction - Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno - laugh discreetly.
MOZART No, I don't think you do.
MOZART I mean watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching.
MOZART Stupid fat couples rolling their eyes about!
MOZART That's not love - it's just rubbish.
An embarrassed pause.
Bonno giggles in nervous amusement.
MOZART Majesty, you choose the language.
MOZART It will be my task to set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch.
Pause.
Joseph is clearly pleased.
JOSEPH Well, there it is.
JOSEPH Let it be German.
He nods - he has wanted this result all the time.
He turns and makes for the door.
All bow.
Then he becomes aware of the manuscript in his hand.
JOSEPH Ah, this is yours.
Mozart does not take it.
MOZART Keep it, Sire, if you want to.
MOZART It is already here in my head.
JOSEPH What?
JOSEPH On one hearing only?
MOZART I think so, Sire, yes.
Pause.
JOSEPH Show me.
Mozart bows and hands the manuscript back to the Emperor.
Then he goes to the forte-piano and seats himself.
The others, except for Salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the King.
Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly accuracy.
MOZART The rest is just the same, isn't it?
He plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a phrase, which he repeats dubiously.
MOZART That really doesn't work, does it?
All the courtiers look at Salieri.
MOZART Did you try this?
MOZART Wouldn't it be just a little more -?
He plays another phrase.
MOZART Or this - yes, this!
MOZART Better.
He plays another phrase.
Gradually, he alters the music so that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai.
He plays it with increasing abandon and virtuosity.
Salieri watches with a fixed smile on his face.
The court watches, astonished.
He finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a gesture of triumph - and grins.
We see the olivewood cross.
Salieri is sitting at his desk, staring at it.
SALIERI Grazie, Signore.
There is a knock at the door.
He does not hear it, but sits on.
Another knock, louder.
SALIERI Yes?
Lorl comes in.
LORL Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
SALIERI Bene.
He gets up and enters:
KATHERINA CAVALIERI, a young, high-spirited soprano of twenty is waiting for him, dressed in a fashionable dress and wearing on her head an exotic turban of satin, with a feather.
Lorl exits.
CAVALIERI Maestro.
SALIERI Good morning.
CAVALIERI Well?
CAVALIERI How do you like it?
CAVALIERI It's Turkish.
CAVALIERI My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
SALIERI Really?
SALIERI What else did he tell you today?
SALIERI Give me some gossip.
CAVALIERI Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
SALIERI Oh?
SALIERI News travels fast in Vienna.
CAVALIERI And he's been commissioned to write an opera.
CAVALIERI Is it true?
SALIERI Yes.
CAVALIERI Is there a part for me?
SALIERI No.
CAVALIERI How do you know?
SALIERI Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
CAVALIERI Why not?
SALIERI Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
CAVALIERI Where?
SALIERI In a harem.
CAVALIERI What's that?
SALIERI A brothel.
CAVALIERI Oh!
SALIERI A Turkish brothel.
CAVALIERI Turkish?
CAVALIERI Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different.
CAVALIERI I want to be in it.
SALIERI My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
He seats himself at the forte-piano.
CAVALIERI Oh.
CAVALIERI Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
SALIERI Perhaps.
He plays a chord.
She sings a scale, expertly.
He strikes another chord.
She starts another scale, then breaks off.
CAVALIERI What does he look like?
SALIERI You might be disappointed.
CAVALIERI Why?
SALIERI Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
CAVALIERI Looks don't concern me, Maestro.
CAVALIERI Only talent interests a woman of taste.
He strikes the chord again, firmly.
Cavalieri sings her next scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises in earnest.
As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria.
We DISSOLVE on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish manner, and we are on:
The heroine of the opera (Cavalieri) is in full cry addressing the Pasha with scorn and defiance.
The house is full.
Watching the performance - which is conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra - we note Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and Von Swieten, all grouped around the Emperor, in a box.
In another box we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and three girls, one of whom is Constanze.
This is the formidable MADAME WEBER and her three daughters, Constanze, JOSEFA and SOPHIE.
All are enraptured by the spectacle and Madame Weber is especially enraptured by being there at all.
Not so, Salieri, who sits in another box, coldly watching the stage.
Cavalieri is singing Martern aller Arten from the line Doch du bist entschlossen.
CAVALIERI Since you are determined, Since you are determined, Calmly, with no ferment, Welcome - every pain and woe.
CAVALIERI Bind me then - compel me!
CAVALIERI Bind me then - compel me!
CAVALIERI Hurt me.
CAVALIERI Break me!
CAVALIERI Kill me!
CAVALIERI At last I shall be freed by death!
After a few moments of this showy aria, with the composer and the singer staring at each other - he conducting elaborately for her benefit, and she following his beat with rapturous eyes - the music fades, and Salieri speaks over it.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) There she was.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) I had no idea where they met - or how - yet there she stood on stage for all to see.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Showing off like the greedy songbird she was.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Ten minutes of ghastly scales and arpeggios, whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground.
Music up again for the last 30 bars of the aria.
CAVALIERI Be freed at last by death!
CAVALIERI Be freed at last by death!
CAVALIERI At last I shall be freed By!
CAVALIERI Death!
Before the orchestral coda ends, cut to:
Through the window we see that night has fallen.
OLD SALIERI Understand, I was in love with the girl.
OLD SALIERI Or at least in lust.
OLD SALIERI I wasn't a saint.
OLD SALIERI It took me the most tremendous effort to be faithful to my vow.
OLD SALIERI I swear to you I never laid a finger on her.
OLD SALIERI All the same, I couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her - least of all the Creature.
The brilliant Turkish finale of Seraglio bursts over us.
All the cast is lined up on stage.
Mozart is conducting with happy excitement.
CAST OF SERAGLIO Pasha Selim May he Live forever!
CAST OF SERAGLIO Ever, ever, ever, ever!
CAST OF SERAGLIO Honour to his regal name!
CAST OF SERAGLIO Honour to his regal name!
CAST OF SERAGLIO May his noble brow emblazon Glory, fortune, joy and fame!
CAST OF SERAGLIO Honour be to Pasha Selim Honour to his regal name!
CAST OF SERAGLIO Honour to his regal name!
The curtains fall.
Much applause.
The Emperor claps vigorously and - following his lead - so do the courtiers.
The curtains part.
Mozart applauds the singers who applaud him back.
He skips up onto the stage amongst them.
The curtains fall again as they all bow.
In the auditorium, the chandeliers descend, filling it with light.
The curtains are down, and an excited hubbub of singers in costume surround Mozart and Cavalieri, all excited and chattering.
Suddenly a hush.
The Emperor is seen approaching from the wings, lit by flunkies holding candles.
Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg and Von Swieten, amongst others, follow him.
Also Salieri.
The singers line up.
Joseph stops at Cavalieri who makes a deep curtsey.
JOSEPH Bravo, Madame.
JOSEPH You are an ornament to our stage.
CAVALIERI Majesty.
JOSEPH And to you, Court Composer.
JOSEPH Your pupil has done you great credit.
MADAME WEBER Let us pass, please!
MADAME WEBER Let us pass at once!
MADAME WEBER We're with the Emperor.
FLUNKY I am sorry, Madame.
FLUNKY It is not permitted.
MADAME WEBER Do you know who I am?
MADAME WEBER This is my daughter.
MADAME WEBER I am Frau Weber.
MADAME WEBER We are favoured guests!
FLUNKY I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
MADAME WEBER Call Herr Mozart!
MADAME WEBER You call Herr Mozart immediately!
MADAME WEBER This is insupportable!
CONSTANZE Mother, please!
MADAME WEBER Go ahead, Constanze.
MADAME WEBER Just ignore this fellow.
MADAME WEBER Go ahead, dear!
FLUNKY I am sorry, Madame, but no!
FLUNKY I cannot let anyone pass.
MADAME WEBER Young man, I am no stranger to theatres.
MADAME WEBER I'm no stranger to insolence!
All are applauding Cavalieri.
The Emperor turns to Mozart.
JOSEPH Well, Herr Mozart!
JOSEPH A good effort.
JOSEPH Decidedly that.
JOSEPH An excellent effort!
JOSEPH You've shown us something quite new today.
Mozart bows frantically: he is over-excited.
MOZART It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
JOSEPH Yes, indeed.
MOZART And German?
JOSEPH Oh, yes.
JOSEPH Absolutely.
JOSEPH German.
JOSEPH Unquestionably!
MOZART So then you like it?
MOZART You really like it, Your Majesty?
JOSEPH Of course I do.
JOSEPH It's very good.
JOSEPH Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
MOZART What do you mean, Sire?
JOSEPH Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?
JOSEPH How shall one say, Director?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Too many notes, Your Majesty?
JOSEPH Exactly.
JOSEPH Very well put.
JOSEPH Too many notes.
MOZART I don't understand.
MOZART There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required.
MOZART Neither more nor less.
JOSEPH My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening.
JOSEPH I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
SALIERI Yes!
SALIERI yes!
SALIERI er, on the whole, yes, Majesty.
MOZART But this is absurd!
JOSEPH My dear, young man, don't take it too hard.
JOSEPH Your work is ingenious.
JOSEPH It's quality work.
JOSEPH And there are simply too many notes, that's all.
JOSEPH Cut a few and it will be perfect.
MOZART Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Pause.
General embarrassment.
JOSEPH Well.
JOSEPH There it is.
Into this uncomfortable scene bursts a sudden eruption of noise and Madame Weber floods onto the stage, followed by her daughters.
All turn to look at this amazing spectacle.
MADAME WEBER Wolfi!
MADAME WEBER Wolfi, my dear!
She moves toward Mozart with arms outstretched in an absurd theatrical gesture, then sees the Emperor.
She stares at him, mesmerized, her mouth open, unable even to curtsey.
MADAME WEBER Oh!
Mozart moves forward quickly.
MOZART Majesty, this is Madame Weber.
MOZART She is my landlady.
JOSEPH Enchanted, Madame.
MADAME WEBER Oh, Sire!
MADAME WEBER such an honour!
MADAME WEBER And, and, and these are my dear daughters.
MADAME WEBER This is Constanze.
MADAME WEBER She is the fiancee of Herr Mozart.
Constanze curtsies.
CU, of Cavalieri, astonished at the news.
CU, of Salieri, watching her receive it.
JOSEPH Really?
JOSEPH How delightful.
JOSEPH May I ask when you marry?
MOZART Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty.
MOZART Not entirely.
MOZART Not altogether.
He giggles uncomfortably.
JOSEPH Excuse me, but how old are you?
MOZART Twenty-six.
JOSEPH Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
MADAME WEBER You see?
MADAME WEBER You see?
MADAME WEBER I've told him that, Your Majesty, but he won't listen to me.
Cavalieri is glaring at Mozart.
Mozart looks hastily away from her.
MADAME WEBER Oh, Your Majesty, you give such wonderful - such impeccable - such royal advice.
MADAME WEBER I - I - May I?
She attempts to kiss the royal hand, but faints instead.
The Emperor contemplates her prone body and steps back a pace.
JOSEPH Well.
JOSEPH There it is.
JOSEPH Strack.
He nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage, with his Chamberlain.
All bow.
Cavalieri turns with a savage look at Mozart and leaves the stage the opposite way, to her dressing room, tossing her plumed head.
Salieri watches.
Mozart stays for a second, indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber.
CONSTANZE Get some water!
He hurries away.
The daughters gather around Madame Weber.
Katherina sits fuming at her mirror.
A dresser is taking the pins out of her wig as she stares straight ahead of her.
Mozart sticks his head round the door.
MOZART Katherina!
MOZART I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
MOZART I'm going to write another aria for you.
MOZART Something even more amazing for the second act.
MOZART I have to get some water.
MOZART Her mother is lying on the stage.
CAVALIERI Don't bother!
MOZART What?
CAVALIERI Don't bother.
MOZART I'll be right back.
He dashes off.
Constanze and Mozart make their way quickly through a crowd of actors in turbans and caftans, and stagehands carrying bits of the dismantled set of Seraglio.
We see all the turmoil of backstage after a performance.
A fireman passes Mozart carrying a small bucket of water.
Mozart snatches it from him and pushes his way through the crowd to Madame Weber, who still lies prone on the stage.
Mozart pushes through the crowd surrounding her and throws water on her face.
She is instantly revived by the shock.
Constanze assists her to rise.
CONSTANZE Are you all right?
Instead of being furious, Madame Weber smiles at them rapturously.
MADAME WEBER Ah, what an evening!
MADAME WEBER What a wise man we have for an Emperor.
MADAME WEBER Oh, my children!
MADAME WEBER Now I want you to write your father exactly what His Majesty said.
The activity continues to swirl around them.
MOZART You should really go home now, Frau Weber.
MOZART Your carriage must be waiting.
MADAME WEBER But aren't you taking us?
MOZART I have to talk to the singers.
MADAME WEBER That's all right; we'll wait for you.
MADAME WEBER Just don't take all night.
Cavalieri, still in costume, is marching up and down, very agitated.
CAVALIERI Did you know?
CAVALIERI Had you heard?
SALIERI What?
CAVALIERI The marriage!
SALIERI Well, what does it matter to you?
CAVALIERI Nothing!
CAVALIERI He can marry who he pleases.
CAVALIERI I don't give a damn.
She catches him looking at her and tries to compose herself.
CAVALIERI How was I?
CAVALIERI Tell me honestly.
SALIERI You were sublime.
CAVALIERI What did you think of the music?
SALIERI Extremely clever.
CAVALIERI Meaning you didn't like it.
Mozart comes in unexpectedly.
MOZART Oh - excuse me!
CAVALIERI Is her mother still lying on the floor?
MOZART No, she's fine.
CAVALIERI I'm so relieved.
She seats herself at her mirror and removes her wig.
SALIERI Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
MOZART Did you like it, then?
SALIERI How could I not?
MOZART It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today.
MOZART Don't you agree?
CAVALIERI Is she a good fuck?
MOZART What??
CAVALIERI I assume she's the virtuoso in that department.
CAVALIERI There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Salieri looks astonished.
There is a knock on the door.
CAVALIERI Come in!
The door opens.
Constanze enters.
CONSTANZE Excuse me, Wolfi.
CONSTANZE Mama is not feeling very well.
CONSTANZE Can we leave now?
MOZART Of course.
CAVALIERI No, no, no, no.
CAVALIERI You can't take him away now.
CAVALIERI This is his night.
CAVALIERI Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
MOZART Excuse us, Fraulein.
MOZART Good night, Signore.
Mozart hurries Constanze out of the door.
Cavalieri looks after them as they go, her voice breaking and rising out of control.
CAVALIERI You really are full of surprises, aren't you?
CAVALIERI You are quite extraordinary, you little shit!
She turns and collapses, crying with rage, into Salieri's arms.
We focus on him.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) At that moment I knew beyond any doubt.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) He'd had her.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) The Creature had had my darling girl.
The old man speaks passionately to the priest.
OLD SALIERI It was incomprehensible.
OLD SALIERI What was God up to?
OLD SALIERI Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married!
OLD SALIERI - and no rebuke at all!
OLD SALIERI Was it possible I was being tested?
OLD SALIERI Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful?
OLD SALIERI That was very possible.
OLD SALIERI All the same, why him?
OLD SALIERI Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility?
OLD SALIERI My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man.
OLD SALIERI For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts.
OLD SALIERI I couldn't stop them.
VOGLER Did you try?
OLD SALIERI Every day.
OLD SALIERI Sometimes for hours I would pray!
The young Salieri is kneeling in desperation before the Cross.
SALIERI Please!
SALIERI Please!
SALIERI Send him away, back to Salzburg.
SALIERI For his sake as well as mine.
CU, Christ staring from the Cross.
We see Leopold kneeling now not to the Cross but to Archbishop Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne.
Count Arco stands beside him.
Leopold is a desperate, once-handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier.
COLLOREDO No!
COLLOREDO I won't have him back.
LEOPOLD But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace.
LEOPOLD He needs me and he needs you.
LEOPOLD Your protection, your understanding.
COLLOREDO Hardly.
LEOPOLD Oh sir, yes!
LEOPOLD He's about to make the worst mistake of his life.
LEOPOLD Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage.
LEOPOLD I know my son.
LEOPOLD He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
COLLOREDO I'm not surprised.
COLLOREDO Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship.
COLLOREDO He has sold himself to Vienna.
COLLOREDO Let Vienna look out for him.
LEOPOLD Sir -
COLLOREDO Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
LEOPOLD Yes, sir, that's the truth.
LEOPOLD But don't blame him.
LEOPOLD The fault is mine.
LEOPOLD I was too indulgent with him.
LEOPOLD But not again.
LEOPOLD Never again, I promise!
LEOPOLD I implore you - let me bring him back here.
LEOPOLD I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
COLLOREDO And how will you make him keep it?
LEOPOLD Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything.
LEOPOLD Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
COLLOREDO You have leave to try.
LEOPOLD Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace!
LEOPOLD I thank you!
In deepest gratitude he kisses the Archbishop's hand.
He motions Leopold to rise.
We hear the first dark fortissimo chord which begins the Overture to Don Giovanni: the theme associated with the character of the Commendatore.
LEOPOLD (V.O.) My dear son.
The second fortissimo chord sounds.
We see a huge CU, of Mozart's head, looking front and down, as if reading his father's letter.
We hear Leopold's voice over this image, no longer whining and anxious, but impressive.
LEOPOLD (V.O.) I write to you with urgent news.
LEOPOLD (V.O.) I am coming to Vienna.
LEOPOLD (V.O.) Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet.
LEOPOLD (V.O.) You are too gullible to see your own danger.
LEOPOLD (V.O.) As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
MOZART I will.
The camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling beside Constanze.
A PRIEST faces them.
Behind them are Madame Weber, Josefa and Sophie Weber, and a very few others.
Among them, a merry looking lady in bright clothes: the BARONESS
PRIEST And will you, Constanze Weber, take this man, Wolfgang to be your lawful husband?
CONSTANZE I will.
PRIEST I now pronounce you man and wife.
The opening kyrie of the great Mass in C Minor is heard.
Mozart and Constanze kiss.
They are in tears.
Madame Weber and her daughters look on approvingly.
The music swells and continues under the following:
There is a view of a castle in background.
Leopold sits alone in his room.
He is reading a letter from Wolfgang.
At his feet are his trunks, half-packed for the journey he will not now take.
We hear Mozart's voice reading the following letter and we see, as the camera roves around the room, mementos of the young prodigy's early life: the little forte-piano made for him; the little violin made for him; an Order presented to him.
We see a little starling in a wicker cage.
And we see portraits of the boy on the walls, concluding with the familiar family portrait of Wolfgang and his sister Nannerl seated at the keyboard with Leopold standing, and the picture of their mother on the wall behind them.
MOZART (V.O.) Most beloved father, it is done.
MOZART (V.O.) Do not blame me that I did not wait to see your dear face.
MOZART (V.O.) I knew you would have tried to dissuade me from my truest happiness and I could not have borne it.
MOZART (V.O.) Your every word is precious to me.
MOZART (V.O.) Remember how you have always told me Vienna is the City of Musicians.
MOZART (V.O.) To conquer here is to conquer Europe!
MOZART (V.O.) With my wife I can do it.
MOZART (V.O.) I vow I will become regular in my habits and productive as never before.
MOZART (V.O.) She is wonderful, Papa, and I know that you will love her.
MOZART (V.O.) And one day soon when I am a wealthy man, you will come and live with us, and we will be so happy.
MOZART (V.O.) I long for that day, best of Papas, and kiss your hand a hundred thousand times.
The music of the Mass fades as Leopold crumples the letter in his hand.
Salieri stands waiting, hat in hand.
Beside him stands a royal servant.
Behind him, gardeners are glimpsed tending the shrubs and bushes along a grassy ride.
Down this ride are seen cantering two people on horseback: the Emperor Joseph and his niece, the PRINCESS ELIZABETH.
They are mounted on glossy horses.
The Princess rides side-saddle.
Running beside her is a panting groom.
The Emperor rides elegantly; his niece, a dumpy little Hapsburg girl of sixteen, like a sack of potatoes.
As they draw level with Salieri they stop, and the groom holds the head of the Princess' horse.
Salieri bows respectfully.
JOSEPH Good morning, Court Composer.
JOSEPH This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
SALIERI Your Highness.
Out of breath, the Princess nods nervously.
JOSEPH She has asked me to advise her on a suitable musical instructor.
JOSEPH I think I've come up with an excellent idea.
He smiles at Salieri.
SALIERI Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
JOSEPH I'm thinking about Herr Mozart.
JOSEPH What is your view?
Salieri's face falls, almost imperceptibly.
SALIERI An interesting idea, Majesty.
SALIERI But -
JOSEPH Yes?
SALIERI You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
JOSEPH And the result satisfies.
SALIERI Yes, of course.
SALIERI My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
JOSEPH Ah-ha.
JOSEPH Favouritism.
JOSEPH But I so want Mozart.
SALIERI I'm sure there is a way, Majesty.
SALIERI Some kind of a little contest.
SALIERI I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
JOSEPH You please me, Court Composer.
JOSEPH A very clever idea.
SALIERI Sire.
JOSEPH Well.
JOSEPH There it is.
He rides on.
The groom releases her horse's head, and runs on after the Princess.
Von Strack sits stiffly behind his gilded desk.
Mozart stands before him, trembling with anger.
MOZART What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
VON STRACK What is what?
MOZART Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee?
MOZART Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
VON STRACK Because His Majesty wishes it.
MOZART Is the Emperor angry with me?
VON STRACK On the contrary.
MOZART Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
VON STRACK Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
MOZART No, but I'm the best.
VON STRACK A little modesty would suit you better.
MOZART Who is on this committee?
VON STRACK Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
MOZART Naturally, the Italians!
MOZART Of course!
MOZART Always the Italians!
VON STRACK Mozart -
MOZART They hate my music.
MOZART It terrifies them.
MOZART The only sound Italians understand is banality.
MOZART Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!
MOZART Ba-ba!
MOZART Ba-ba!
MOZART Ba-ba!
MOZART Ba-ba!
MOZART Anything else is morbid.
VON STRACK Mozart -
MOZART Show them one interesting modulation and they faint.
MOZART Ohime!
MOZART Morbidezza!
MOZART Morbidezza!
MOZART Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
VON STRACK Look, young man, the issue is simple.
VON STRACK If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
MOZART Must I?
MOZART Well, I won't!
MOZART I tell you straight: I will not!
The room is very small and untidy.
Constanze is marching up and down it, upset.
Mozart is lying on the bed.
CONSTANZE I think you're mad!
CONSTANZE You're really mad!
MOZART Oh, leave me alone.
CONSTANZE One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking.
CONSTANZE We'd be set up for life!
MOZART They'll come anyway.
MOZART They love me here.
CONSTANZE No, they will not.
CONSTANZE I know how things work in this city.
MOZART Oh yes?
MOZART You always know everything.
CONSTANZE Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
MOZART You borrowed money from your mother?
CONSTANZE Yes!
MOZART Well, don't do that again!
CONSTANZE How are we going to live, Wolfi?
CONSTANZE Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
MOZART Don't be stupid.
CONSTANZE All they want to see is your work.
CONSTANZE What's wrong with that?
MOZART Shut up!
MOZART Just shut up!
MOZART I don't need them.
CONSTANZE This isn't pride.
CONSTANZE It's sheer stupidity!
She glares at him, almost in tears.
Salieri is giving a lesson to a girl student, who is singing the Italian art song, Caro Mio Ben.
There is a knock on the door.
SALIERI Yes.
A SERVANT enters.
SERVANT Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
SALIERI Who is she?
SERVANT She didn't say.
SERVANT But she says it's urgent.
SALIERI Excuse me, my dear.
Salieri goes into the salon.
Constanze stands, closely veiled, holding a portfolio stuffed with manuscripts.
The singing lesson ends, with two chords on the instrument.
Salieri enters the salon.
Constanze drops him a shy curtsey.
CONSTANZE Excellency!
SALIERI Madame.
SALIERI How can I help you?
Shyly, she unveils.
SALIERI Frau Mozart?
CONSTANZE That's right, Your Excellency.
CONSTANZE I've come on behalf of my hus band.
CONSTANZE I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
SALIERI How charming.
SALIERI But why did he not come himself?
CONSTANZE He's terribly busy, sir.
SALIERI I understand.
He takes the portfolio and puts it on a table.
SALIERI I will look at them, of course, the moment I can.
SALIERI It will be an honour.
SALIERI Please give him my warmest.
CONSTANZE Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now?
CONSTANZE While I wait.
SALIERI I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment.
SALIERI Just leave them with me.
SALIERI I assure you they will be quite safe.
CONSTANZE I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency.
CONSTANZE You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
SALIERI Really?
CONSTANZE My husband is a proud man, sir.
CONSTANZE He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
SALIERI Then he didn't send you?
CONSTANZE No, sir.
CONSTANZE This is my own idea.
SALIERI I see.
CONSTANZE Sir, we really need this job.
CONSTANZE We're desperate.
CONSTANZE My husband spends far more than he can ever earn.
CONSTANZE I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long.
CONSTANZE It's just!
CONSTANZE he's not practical.
CONSTANZE Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency.
CONSTANZE I know you help musicians.
CONSTANZE You're famous for it.
CONSTANZE Give him just this one post.
CONSTANZE We'd be forever indebted!
A short pause.
SALIERI Let me offer you some refreshment.
SALIERI Do you know what these are?
He indicates a dish piled high with glazed chestnuts.
SALIERI Cappezzoli di Venere.
SALIERI Nipples of Venus.
SALIERI Roman chestnuts in brandied sugar.
SALIERI Won't you try one?
SALIERI They're quite surprising.
He offers her the dish.
She takes one and puts it in her mouth.
He watches carefully.
CONSTANZE Oh!
CONSTANZE They're wonderful.
He takes one himself.
We notice on his finger a heavy gold signet-ring.
CONSTANZE Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
SALIERI Don't keep calling me that.
SALIERI It puts me at such a distance.
SALIERI I was not born a Court Composer, you know.
SALIERI I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
He smiles at her.
She takes another chestnut.
SALIERI Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again?
SALIERI I have other things you might like.
CONSTANZE That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid.
CONSTANZE Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing.
CONSTANZE You see, they're all originals.
SALIERI Originals?
CONSTANZE Yes.
A pause.
He puts out his hand and takes up the portfolio from the table.
He opens it.
He looks at the music.
He is puzzled.
SALIERI These are originals?
CONSTANZE Yes, sir.
CONSTANZE He doesn't make copies.
The old man faces the Priest.
OLD SALIERI Astounding!
OLD SALIERI It was actually beyond belief.
OLD SALIERI These were first and only drafts of music yet they showed no corrections of any kind.
OLD SALIERI Not one.
OLD SALIERI Do you realize what that meant?
Vogler stares at him.
OLD SALIERI He'd simply put down music already finished in his head.
OLD SALIERI Page after page of it, as if he was just taking dictation.
OLD SALIERI And music finished as no music is ever finished.
CU, The manuscript in Mozart's handwriting.
The music begins to sound under the following:
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Displace one note and there would be diminishment.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) It was clear to me.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) That sound I had heard in the Archbishop's palace had been no accident.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Here again was the very voice of God!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) I was staring through the cage of those meticulous ink- strokes at an absolute, inimitable beauty.
The music swells.
What we now hear is an amazing collage of great passages from Mozart's music, ravishing to Salieri and to us.
The Court Composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when he is done with them.
We see his agonized and wondering face: he shudders as if in a rough and tumbling sea; he experiences the point where beauty and great pain coalesce.
More pages fall than he can read, scattering across the floor in a white cascade, as he circles the room.
Finally, we hear the tremendous Qui Tollis from the Mass in C Minor.
It seems to break over him like a wave and, unable to bear any more of it, he slams the portfolio shut.
Instantly, the music breaks off, reverberating in his head.
He stands shaking, staring wildly.
Constanze gets up, perplexed.
CONSTANZE Is it no good?
A pause.
SALIERI It is miraculous.
CONSTANZE Oh yes.
CONSTANZE He's really proud of his work.
Another pause.
CONSTANZE So, will you help him?
Salieri tries to recover himself.
SALIERI Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor.
SALIERI One word from me and the post is his.
CONSTANZE Oh, thank you, sir!
Overjoyed, she stops and kisses his hand.
He raises her - and then clasps her to him clumsily.
She pushes herself away.
SALIERI Come back tonight.
CONSTANZE Tonight?
SALIERI Alone.
CONSTANZE What for?
SALIERI Some service deserves service in return.
SALIERI No?
CONSTANZE What do you mean?
SALIERI Isn't it obvious?
They stare at one another: Constanze in total disbelief.
SALIERI It's a post all Vienna seeks.
SALIERI If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
CONSTANZE But!
CONSTANZE I'm a married woman!
SALIERI Then don't.
SALIERI It's up to you.
SALIERI Not to be vague, that is the price.
He glares at her.
SALIERI Yes.
He rings a silver bell for a servant and abruptly leaves the roam.
Constanze stares after him, horrified.
The servant enters.
Shocked and stunned, Constanze goes down an her knees and starts picking up the music from the floor.
CU, Father Vogler, horrified.
OLD SALIERI Yes, Father.
OLD SALIERI Yes!
OLD SALIERI So much for my vow of chastity.
OLD SALIERI What did it matter?
OLD SALIERI Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter?
OLD SALIERI Had goodness made me a good composer?
OLD SALIERI I realized
it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art.
And I was nothing to God.
VOGLER You cannot say that!
OLD SALIERI No?
OLD SALIERI Was Mozart a good man?
VOGLER God's ways are not yours.
VOGLER And you are not here to question Him.
VOGLER Offer him the salt of penitence.
VOGLER He will give you back the bread of eternal life.
VOGLER He is all merciful.
VOGLER That is all you need to know.
OLD SALIERI All I ever wanted was to sing to Him.
OLD SALIERI That's His doing, isn't it?
OLD SALIERI He gave me that longing - then made me mute.
OLD SALIERI Why?
OLD SALIERI Tell me that.
OLD SALIERI If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent?
OLD SALIERI Go on, tell me!
OLD SALIERI Speak for Him!
VOGLER My son, no one can speak for God.
OLD SALIERI Oh?
OLD SALIERI I thought you did so every day.
OLD SALIERI So speak now.
OLD SALIERI Answer me!
VOGLER I do not claim to unravel the mysteries.
VOGLER I treasure them.
VOGLER As you should.
OLD SALIERI Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
OLD SALIERI Always the same stale answers!
OLD SALIERI There is no God of Mercy, Father.
OLD SALIERI Just a God of torture.
Salieri sits at his desk, staring up at the cross.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Evening came to that room.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) I sat there not knowing whether the girl would return or not.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) I prayed as I'd never prayed before.
SALIERI Dear God, enter me now.
SALIERI Fill me with one piece of true music.
SALIERI One piece with your breath in it, so I know that you love me.
SALIERI Please.
SALIERI Just one.
SALIERI Show me one sign of your favour, and I will show mine to Mozart and his wife.
SALIERI I will get him the royal position, and if she comes, I'll receive her with all respect and send her home in joy.
SALIERI Enter me!
SALIERI Enter me!
SALIERI Please!
SALIERI Te imploro.
Long, long silence.
Salieri stares at the cross.
Christ stares back at him impassively.
Finally in this silence we hear a faint knocking at the door.
Salieri stirs himself.
A servant appears.
SERVANT That lady is back, sir.
SALIERI Show her in.
SALIERI Then go to bed.
The Servant bows and leaves.
We follow him through:
The Servant crosses it and enters:
Constanze is sitting on an upright chair, veiled as before, the portfolio of music on her lap.
Through the far door leading from the hall, another servant is peering at her.
The first servant joins him and shuts the door on the girl, leaving her alone.
We stay with her.
The clock ticks on the mantelpiece.
We hear an old carriage pass in the street below.
Nervously she lifts her veil and looks about her.
Suddenly Salieri appears from the music room.
He is pale and very tight.
They regard each other.
She smiles and rises to greet him, affecting a relaxed and warm manner, as if to put him at his ease.
CONSTANZE Well, I'm here.
CONSTANZE My husband has gone to a concert.
CONSTANZE He didn't think I would enjoy it.
A pause.
CONSTANZE I do apologize for this afternoon.
CONSTANZE I behaved like a silly girl.
CONSTANZE Where shall we go?
SALIERI What?
CONSTANZE Should we stay here?
CONSTANZE It's a charming room.
CONSTANZE I love these candlesticks.
CONSTANZE Were they here earlier?
CONSTANZE I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
As she talks, she extinguishes the candles in a pair of Venetian candelabra and subsequently other candles around the room.
CONSTANZE Wolfgang was given some candlesticks by King George in England, but they were only wood.
CONSTANZE Oh, excuse me.
CONSTANZE Let's not talk about him.
CONSTANZE What do you think of this?
CONSTANZE It's real lace.
CONSTANZE Brussels.
She turns and takes off her shawl.
CONSTANZE Well, it's much too good for every day.
CONSTANZE I keep saying to Wolfi, don't be so extravagant.
CONSTANZE Presents are lovely, but we can't afford them.
CONSTANZE It doesn't do any good.
CONSTANZE The more I tell him, the more he spends.
CONSTANZE Oh, excuse me!
CONSTANZE There I go again.
She picks up the portfolio.
CONSTANZE Do you still want to look at this?
CONSTANZE Or don't we need to bother anymore?
CONSTANZE I imagine we don't, really.
She looks at him inquiringly, and drops the portfolio on the floor; pages of music pour out of it.
Instantly we hear a massive chord, and the great Qui Tollis from the Mass in C Minor fills the room.
To its grand and weighty sound, Constanze starts to undress, watched by the horrified Salieri.
Between him and her, music is an active presence, hurting and baffling him.
He opens his mouth in distress.
The music pounds in his head.
The candle flickers over her as she removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace.
Suddenly he cries out.
SALIERI Go!
SALIERI Go!
SALIERI Go!
He snatches up the bell and shakes it frantically, not stopping until the two servants we saw earlier appear at the door.
The music stops abruptly.
They stare at the appalled and frightened Constanze, who is desperately trying to cover her nakedness.
SALIERI Show this woman out!
Constanze hurls herself at him.
CONSTANZE You shit!
CONSTANZE You shit!
CONSTANZE You rotten shit!
He seizes her wrists and thrusts her back.
Then he leaves the room quickly, slamming the door behind him.
Constanze turns and sees the two servants goggling at her in the room.
CONSTANZE What are you staring at?
Wildly, she picks up the candelabrum and throws it at them.
It shatters on the floor.
CU, Salieri standing, his eyes shut, shaking in distress.
He opens them and sees Christ across the room, staring at him from the wall.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) From now on, we are enemies, You and
The old man is reliving the experience.
Vogler looks at him, horrified.
OLD SALIERI Because You will not enter me, with all my need for you; because You scorn my attempts at virtue; because You choose for Your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty infantile boy and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the Incarnation; because You are unjust, unfair, unkind, I will block You!
OLD SALIERI I swear it!
OLD SALIERI I will hinder and harm Your creature on earth as far as I am able.
OLD SALIERI I will ruin Your Incarnation.
CU, the fireplace.
In it lies the olivewood Christ on the cross, burning.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) What use after all is Man, if not to teach God His lessons?
The cross flames up and disintegrates.
Salieri stares at it.
The front door bursts open.
Mozart stumbles in, followed by EMMANUEL SCHIKANEDER, three young actresses, and another man, all fairly drunk.
Schikaneder (who appears everywhere accompanied by young girls) is a large, fleshy, extravagant man of about thirty-five.
MOZART Stanzi!
MOZART Stanzi!
MOZART Stanzi-Manzi!
The others laugh.
MOZART Sssh!
SCHIKANEDER Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
MOZART Sssh!
MOZART Stay here.
He walks unsteadily to the bedroom door and opens it.
SCHIKANEDER Sssh!
SCHIKANEDER You're dishgrashful!
Constanze lies in bed, her back turned to her husband, who comes into the room and shuts the door.
MOZART Stanzi?
MOZART How's my mouse?
MOZART Mouse-wouse?
MOZART I'm back - puss-wuss is back!
She turns around abruptly.
She looks dreadful; her eyes red with weeping.
Mozart is shocked.
MOZART Stanzi!
He approaches the bed and sits on it.
Immediately she starts crying again, desperately.
MOZART What's the matter?
MOZART What is it?
MOZART Stanzi!
He holds her and she clings to him in a fierce embrace, crying a flood of tears.
MOZART Stop it now.
MOZART Stop it.
MOZART I've brought some friends to meet you.
MOZART They're next door waiting.
MOZART Do we have anything to eat?
MOZART They're all starving.
CONSTANZE Tell them to go away.
CONSTANZE I don't want to see anybody.
MOZART What's the matter with you?
CONSTANZE Tell them to go!
MOZART Sssh.
MOZART What is it?
MOZART Tell me.
CONSTANZE No!
MOZART Yes!
CONSTANZE I love you!
CONSTANZE I love you!
She starts crying again, throwing her arms around his neck.
CONSTANZE I love you.
CONSTANZE Please stay with me.
CONSTANZE I'm frightened.
Joseph sits eating.
A butler serves him goat's milk to drink.
Joseph is holding a memorandum from Salieri in his hand.
Salieri stands before him.
JOSEPH I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
SALIERI Majesty, I did.
SALIERI Believe me, it was a most agonizing.
SALIERI decision.
SALIERI But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
JOSEPH Why not?
SALIERI Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way.
SALIERI I was curious to know why he had so few pupils.
SALIERI It is rather alarming.
JOSEPH Oh?
With a gesture Joseph dismisses the butler, who bows and leaves the room.
SALIERI Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
JOSEPH Of course not.
SALIERI I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
JOSEPH Really?
SALIERI As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
JOSEPH Yes?
SALIERI Molested, Majesty.
SALIERI Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
A pause.
JOSEPH Ah-ha.
JOSEPH Well.
JOSEPH There it is.
Salieri has just returned from the palace and is coming up the staircase.
He is met by his servant.
SERVANT Sir, there is a Herr Mozart waiting for you in the salon.
Salieri is plainly alarmed.
SALIERI What does he want?
SERVANT He didn't say, sir.
SERVANT I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
SALIERI Come with me.
SALIERI And stay in the room.
He mounts the stairs.
Mozart is waiting for Salieri, holding a portfolio.
Salieri approaches him nervously.
Mozart stands not belligerently, but humbly.
SALIERI Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
MOZART Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work.
MOZART Here they are.
MOZART I don't have to tell you how much I need your help.
MOZART I truly appreciate your looking at these.
MOZART I have pressures on me - financial pressures.
MOZART As you know, I'm a married man now.
SALIERI So you are.
SALIERI How is your pretty wife?
MOZART She is well.
MOZART She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father!
MOZART She only told me last night.
MOZART You are the first to know.
SALIERI I'm flattered.
SALIERI And congratulations to you, of course.
MOZART So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Salieri looks at him in distress.
SALIERI Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart?
SALIERI This is a most painful situation.
SALIERI Yesterday I could have helped you.
SALIERI Today, I can't.
MOZART Why?
MOZART Here is the music.
MOZART It's here.
MOZART I am submitting it humbly.
MOZART Isn't that what you wanted?
SALIERI I have just come from the palace.
SALIERI The post has been filled.
MOZART Filled?
MOZART That's impossible!
MOZART They haven't even seen my work.
MOZART I need this post.
MOZART Please, can't you help me?
MOZART Please!
SALIERI My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
MOZART Whom did they choose?
SALIERI Herr Sommer.
MOZART Sommer?
MOZART Herr Sommer?
MOZART But the man's a fool!
MOZART He's a total mediocrity.
SALIERI No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
MOZART But I can't lose this post, I simply can't!
MOZART Excellency, please.
MOZART Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice.
MOZART He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
SALIERI An implausible idea.
SALIERI Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
Mozart chuckles delightedly.
Salieri offers him a glass of white dessert and a spoon.
Mozart takes it absently and goes on talking.
MOZART Look, I must have pupils.
MOZART Without pupils I can't manage.
SALIERI You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
MOZART No, but I'm broke.
MOZART I'm always broke.
MOZART I don't know why.
SALIERI It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
MOZART How can anyone say that?
MOZART We have no cook, no maid.
MOZART We have no footman.
MOZART Nothing at all!
SALIERI How is that possible?
SALIERI You give concerts, don't you?
SALIERI I hear they are quite successful.
MOZART They're stupendously successful.
MOZART You can't get a seat.
MOZART The only problem is none will hire me.
MOZART They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters.
MOZART As if I was some kind of fiend.
MOZART I'm not a fiend!
SALIERI Of course not.
MOZART Do you have a daughter?
SALIERI I'm afraid not.
MOZART Well, could you lend me some money till you have one?
MOZART Then I'll teach her for free.
MOZART That's a promise.
MOZART Oh, I'm sorry.
MOZART I'm being silly.
MOZART Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth.
MOZART Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan?
MOZART Only for six months, eight at most.
MOZART After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna.
MOZART I'll pay you back double.
MOZART Anything.
MOZART Name your terms.
MOZART I'm not joking.
MOZART I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
SALIERI Ah, how exciting!
SALIERI Tell me more.
MOZART I'd better not.
MOZART It's a bit of a secret.
SALIERI Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested.
SALIERI Truly.
MOZART Actually, it's a big secret.
MOZART Oh, this is delicious!
MOZART What is it?
SALIERI Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum.
SALIERI Crema al Mascarpone.
MOZART Ah.
MOZART Italian?
SALIERI Forgive me.
SALIERI We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
MOZART Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred?
MOZART Fifty?
SALIERI What exactly are you working on?
MOZART I can't say.
MOZART Really
SALIERI I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.
SALIERI However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you.
SALIERI And he has a daughter.
SALIERI Will that do?
Hysterical barking and howling.
The hall is full of dogs, at least five, all jumping up and dashing about and making a terrific racket.
Mozart, dandified in a new coat and a plumed hat for the occasion, has arrived to teach at the house of a prosperous merchant, MICHAEL SCHLUMBERG.
Bluff, friendly and coarse-looking, he stands in his hall amidst the leaping and barking animals, greeting Mozart.
SCHLUMBERG Quiet!
SCHLUMBERG Quiet!
SCHLUMBERG Quiet!
SCHLUMBERG Down there, damn you.
SCHLUMBERG Welcome to you.
SCHLUMBERG Pay no attention, they're impossible.
SCHLUMBERG Stop it, you willful things!
SCHLUMBERG Come this way.
SCHLUMBERG Just ignore them.
SCHLUMBERG They're perfectly harmless, just willful.
SCHLUMBERG I treat them just like my own children.
MOZART And which one of them do you want me to teach?
SCHLUMBERG What?
SCHLUMBERG Ha-ha!
SCHLUMBERG That's funny - I like it.
SCHLUMBERG Which one, eh?
SCHLUMBERG You're a funny fellow.
SCHLUMBERG Hannah!
SCHLUMBERG Come this way.
He leads Mozart through the throng of dogs into a salon furnished with comfortable middle-class taste.
SCHLUMBERG Hannah!
FRAU SCHLUMBERG appears: an anxious woman in middle life.
SCHLUMBERG You won't be teaching this one either.
SCHLUMBERG She's my wife.
MOZART Madame.
SCHLUMBERG This is Herr Mozart, my dear.
SCHLUMBERG The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude.
SCHLUMBERG Where is she?
FRAU SCHLUMBERG Upstairs.
SCHLUMBERG Gertrude!
FRAU SCHLUMBERG You can't be Herr Mozart!
MOZART I'm afraid I am.
SCHLUMBERG Of course, it's him.
SCHLUMBERG Who do you think it is?
FRAU SCHLUMBERG I've heard about you for ages!
FRAU SCHLUMBERG I thought you must be an old man.
SCHLUMBERG Gertrude!
FRAU SCHLUMBERG It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG And for Gertrude.
SCHLUMBERG People who know say the girl's got talent.
SCHLUMBERG You must judge for yourself.
SCHLUMBERG If you think she stinks, say so.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG Michael, please!
FRAU SCHLUMBERG I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG She's really very excited.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG She's been preparing all morning.
MOZART Really?
FRAU SCHLUMBERG Ah, now!
FRAU SCHLUMBERG Here she comes.
GERTRUDE SCHLUMBERG appears in the doorway: an awkward girl of fifteen in her best dress, her hair primped and curled.
She is exceedingly nervous.
MOZART Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
SCHLUMBERG Strudel, this is Herr Mozart.
SCHLUMBERG Say good morning.
Gertrude giggles instead.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG Perhaps a little refreshment first?
FRAU SCHLUMBERG A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
MOZART I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG Wine?
SCHLUMBERG Quite right.
SCHLUMBERG He's going to need it.
SCHLUMBERG Klaus!
SCHLUMBERG A bottle of wine.
SCHLUMBERG Prestissimo!
SCHLUMBERG Now let's go to it.
SCHLUMBERG I've been waiting all day for this.
He leads the way into:
A forte-piano is open and waiting.
All the dogs follow him.
After them come Mozart Frau and Fraulein Schlumberg.
To Mozart's dismay, husband and wife seat themselves quite formally on a little narrow sofa, side by side.
SCHLUMBERG Now sit down all of you and behave.
SCHLUMBERG Zeman, Mandi, absolutely quiet!
SCHLUMBERG Especially you, Dudelsachs - not one sound from you.
The dogs settle at their feet.
Husband and wife smile encouragingly at each other.
SCHLUMBERG Come on, then.
SCHLUMBERG Up and at it!
Mozart gestures to the music bench.
Reluctantly, the girl sits at the instrument.
Mozart sits beside her.
MOZART Now, please play me something.
MOZART Just to give me an idea.
MOZART Anything will do.
GERTRUDE I don't want you to stay.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG That's all right, dear.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG Just go ahead, as if we weren't here.
GERTRUDE But you are here.
SCHLUMBERG Never mind, Strudel.
SCHLUMBERG It's part of music, getting used to an audience.
SCHLUMBERG Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
MOZART Well, yes!
MOZART on the whole.
MOZART I suppose.
MOZART How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
FRAU SCHLUMBERG Just one year.
MOZART Who was your teacher?
FRAU SCHLUMBERG I was.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
MOZART Thank you, Madame.
MOZART Come on now - courage.
MOZART Play me something you know.
In response the wretched girl just stares down at the keyboard without playing a note.
An awkward pause.
MOZART Perhaps it would be better if we were left alone.
MOZART I think we're both a little shy.
Husband and wife look at each other.
SCHLUMBERG Nonsense.
SCHLUMBERG Strudel's not shy.
SCHLUMBERG She's just willful!
SCHLUMBERG You give into her now, you'll be sorry later.
SCHLUMBERG Strudel - play.
Silence.
The girl sits unmoving.
Schlumberg bellows:
SCHLUMBERG I said play!
FRAU SCHLUMBERG Michael!
MOZART Perhaps if I were to play a little first, it might encourage the Fraulein.
MOZART Why don't you let me try the instrument?
MOZART All right?
Suddenly the girl rises.
Mozart smiles at the parents.
They smile nervously back.
Mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands and preludes over the keys.
Instantly a dog howls loudly.
Startled, Mozart stops.
Schlumberg leaps to his feet and goes over to the beagle.
SCHLUMBERG Stop that, Dudelsachs!
SCHLUMBERG Stop it at once!
SCHLUMBERG Don't let him disturb you.
SCHLUMBERG He'll be all right.
SCHLUMBERG He's just a little willful too.
SCHLUMBERG Please, please - play.
SCHLUMBERG I beg you.
Mozart resumes playing.
This time it is a lively piece, perhaps the Presto Finale from the K. 450.
The dog howls immediately.
SCHLUMBERG Stop it!
SCHLUMBERG STOP!
Mozart stops.
SCHLUMBERG No, not you.
SCHLUMBERG I was talking to the dog.
SCHLUMBERG You keep playing.
SCHLUMBERG It's most important.
SCHLUMBERG He always howls when he hears music.
SCHLUMBERG We've got to break them of the habit.
SCHLUMBERG Play, please.
SCHLUMBERG Please!
Amazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again.
The dog howls louder.
SCHLUMBERG That's it.
SCHLUMBERG Now keep going, just keep going.
SCHLUMBERG Now you stop that noise, Dudelsachs, you stop it this instant!
SCHLUMBERG This instant, do you hear me?
SCHLUMBERG Keep going, Herr Mozart, that's it.
SCHLUMBERG Go on, go on!
Mozart plays on.
Suddenly the dog falls silent.
Schlumberg smiles broadly.
SCHLUMBERG Good, good, good!
SCHLUMBERG Very good dog!
SCHLUMBERG Very, very good Dudelsachs.
SCHLUMBERG Quick, quick, dear, bring his biscuit.
The wife scurries to get a jar of biscuits.
A servant brings in an open bottle of wine and a full glass on a tray.
He puts it down beside Mozart as Schlumberg addresses the silent dog with deepest affection.
SCHLUMBERG Now guess who's going to get a nice reward?
SCHLUMBERG Clever, clever Dudi.
He gives the biscuit to the dog who swallows it greedily.
Mozart stops playing and stands up.
SCHLUMBERG It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
MOZART Well, I'm a good teacher.
MOZART The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know.
MOZART Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame!
MOZART goodbye, Sir!
He bows to them and leaves the room.
They look after him in puzzled astonishment.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG What a strange young man.
SCHLUMBERG Yes.
SCHLUMBERG He is a little strange.
A cheerful scene.
We see Mozart strutting and beaming, making his way through the crowd of porters, carriers and hawkers, sellers of sausages and pastries, vendors of hats and ribbons.
Horses and carriage clatter past him.
His mood is best expressed by a bubbling version of Non piu Andrai played on the forte-piano.
Still in the same mood, he enters the door of his own house.
Suddenly, he stops.
He looks up the stairs.
The grim opening chords from the Overture to Don Giovanni cut across the march from Figaro.
What he sees, looking up the stairs, is a menacing figure in a long, grey cape and dark grey hat, standing on the landing.
The light comes from behind the figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its arms towards Mozart in an alarming gesture of possession.
It takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held before Mozart realizes who it is.
Then, as the music continues, he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figure's arms.
MOZART Papa!
MOZART PAPA!
Both men embrace.
The music slowly fades.
A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages.
We see music lying everywhere.
Also there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food.
Mozart clasps his father's arms.
Leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair.
His face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health.
MOZART Why are you here?
LEOPOLD Am I not welcome?
MOZART Of course, welcome!
MOZART Welcome ten thousand times.
MOZART Papa!
MOZART my Papa!
He kisses his hands.
LEOPOLD You're very thin.
LEOPOLD Does she not feed you, this wife of yours?
Mozart ducks away and fetches his father's bags from the landing.
MOZART Feed?
MOZART Well, of course she feeds me.
MOZART She stuffs me like a goose all day long.
MOZART She's the best cook in the world.
MOZART I mean, since Mama.
MOZART Just wait, you'll see.
LEOPOLD Is she not here?
MOZART I don't know.
MOZART Stanzi?
MOZART Stanzi!
Leopold looks about him at the mess in the room.
LEOPOLD Do you always live like this?
MOZART Oh, yes.
MOZART Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this.
MOZART I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now.
MOZART She had to go - yes!
MOZART She had to help her mother.
MOZART Yes, she's like that.
MOZART Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
He carries the bag across the room and opens the door of the bedroom.
Constanze lies in bed.
She sits up, startled.
MOZART Oh!
MOZART I didn't know you were home.
MOZART Stanzi, this is my father.
Constanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at Leopold.
Leopold stares back from the doorway.
MOZART We'll wait, we'll wait.
MOZART Why don't you get up now, darling?
He closes the door again.
MOZART She's very tired, poor creature.
MOZART You know me: I'm a real pig.
MOZART It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
LEOPOLD Don't you have a maid?
MOZART Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it.
MOZART She wants to do everything herself.
LEOPOLD How is your financial situation?
MOZART It couldn't be better.
LEOPOLD That's not what I hear.
MOZART What do you mean?
MOZART It's wonderful.
MOZART Really, it's - it's marvelous!
MOZART People love me here.
LEOPOLD They say you're in debt.
MOZART Who?
MOZART Who says that?
MOZART Now that's a malicious lie!
LEOPOLD How many pupils do you have?
MOZART Pupils?
LEOPOLD Yes.
MOZART Yes.
LEOPOLD How many?
MOZART I don't know.
MOZART It's not important.
MOZART I mean, I don't want pupils.
MOZART They get in the way.
MOZART I've got to have time for composition.
LEOPOLD Composition doesn't pay.
LEOPOLD You know that.
MOZART This one will.
He picks up some pages of manuscript.
LEOPOLD What's that?
MOZART Oh, let's not talk about it.
LEOPOLD Why not?
MOZART It's a secret.
LEOPOLD You don't have secrets from me.
MOZART It's too dangerous, Papa.
MOZART But they're going to love it.
MOZART Ah, there she is!
Constanze comes into the room.
She is wearing a dressing gown and has made a perfunctory attempt to tidy her hair.
We see that she is clearly pregnant.
MOZART My Stanzi - look at her!
MOZART Isn't she beautiful?
MOZART Come on now, confess, Papa.
MOZART Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
CONSTANZE Stop it, Wolfi.
CONSTANZE I look dreadful.
CONSTANZE Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
MOZART He's not Herr Mozart.
MOZART Call him Papa.
LEOPOLD I see that you're expecting.
CONSTANZE Oh, yes.
LEOPOLD When, may I ask?
CONSTANZE In three months!
CONSTANZE Papa.
MOZART Isn't that marvelous?
MOZART We're delighted.
LEOPOLD Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
MOZART Didn't I?
MOZART I thought I did.
MOZART I'm sure I did.
He gives a little giggle of embarrassment.
CONSTANZE May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
MOZART Tea?
MOZART Who wants tea?
MOZART Let's go out!
MOZART This calls for a feast.
MOZART You don't want tea, Papa.
MOZART Let's go dancing.
MOZART Papa loves parties, don't you?
CONSTANZE Wolfi!
MOZART What?
MOZART How can you be so boring?
MOZART Tea!
CONSTANZE Wolfi, I think your father's tired.
CONSTANZE I'll cook us something here.
LEOPOLD Thank you.
LEOPOLD That'll be fine.
LEOPOLD Don't spend any money on me.
MOZART Why not?
MOZART Oh, come, Papa!
MOZART What better way could I spend it than on you?
MOZART My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
The jaunty tune of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein (K.539) sounds through all the following.
This is an alternate song from Il Seraglio: a very extroverted tune for baritone and orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum.
The vocal part should be arranged for trumpet.
Mozart and Constanze with Leopold between them.
We see couples shopping.
This is a shop where one can buy costumes for masquerades.
It is filled with extravagant costumes of various kinds.
Wolfgang is wearing a costume, a mask pushed up on his forehead; Constanze is wearing a little white velvet mask.
Amidst the merriment, Leopold is helped by two assistants to put on a dark grey cloak and a dark grey tricorne hat, to which is attached a full mask of dark grey.
Its mouth is cut into a fixed upward smile.
He turns and looks at his son through this mask.
We are in the full whirl of a Masquerade Ball.
Couples are dancing around dressed in fantastic costumes.
The music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein increases in volume and persists.
We see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade above the dancers.
A steer is being roasted.
Through the bobbing crowd we see a group, headed by the figure of Bacchus: this is Schikaneder in a Greek costume, wearing vine leaves in his hair.
He is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses and three other men.
Constanze as Columbine and Mozart as Harlequin are pulling Leopold by the hand of his dark cloak and smiling mask.
This whole group threads its way across the crowded room and disappears through a door.
As they go, they are watched by Salieri, standing alone in a corner, wearing ordinary evening clothes.
He turns away hastily to avoid being seen by them.
As soon as they disappear into the far room, Salieri goes quickly to a lady in the corner who is giving guests domino masks off a tray.
He quickly takes a small black mask and puts it on.
A fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto, lit by candles.
A forte-piano to one side is being played by Schikaneder: the music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein cross-fades to another tune.
This is Vivat Bacchus from Il Seraglio which
Schikaneder, dressed as Bacchus, is humming as he plays.
The music is actually accompanying a game of Forfeits, which has begun.
Five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs.
When the music stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who fails must pay a forfeit.
Constanze is dancing with Leopold; Mozart is dancing with one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together - a little boy and a little girl.
The scene is watched by a circle of bystanders; among them - from the doorway - is Salieri.
Schikaneder stops playing.
Immediately the couples scramble for the chairs.
Leopold and Constanze meet on the same chair, bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of it.
To the amusement of the people around, the chair over- balances and they both end up on the floor.
Constanze immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time.
But Schikaneder calls out from the forte-piano.
SCHIKANEDER No, no!
SCHIKANEDER You both lost.
SCHIKANEDER You both lost.
SCHIKANEDER You both have to forfeit.
SCHIKANEDER And the penalty is you must exchange your wigs.
People are delighted by the idea of this penalty.
The children jump up and down with excitement.
The three actresses immediately surround Leopold, reaching for his hat and mask and wig, whilst he tries to hold on to them.
Mozart takes off Constanze's wig - an absurd affair with side-curls.
Constanze laughingly surrenders it.
LEOPOLD No, please!
LEOPOLD This is ridiculous!
LEOPOLD No, please!
Despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face showing a very different expression underneath.
Another actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on the old man's head.
The third actress takes Constanze's wig from Mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head.
LEOPOLD No, really!
MOZART This is just a game, Papa.
Constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice.
CONSTANZE This is just a game, Papa!
Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the children.
BYSTANDERS This is just a game, Papa!
As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head.
Everybody bursts into applause.
Delightedly, Constanze puts on Leopold's wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a weird parody of Leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig.
Schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to dance.
Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leaves the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone.
Seeing this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father entreatingly by the arm.
MOZART Oh no, Papa, please!
MOZART Don't spoil the fun.
MOZART Come on.
MOZART Here, take mine.
He takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncovered head.
The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs.
He takes Constanze's wig from his father.
As this happens, the music stops again.
Mozart gently pushes his father down onto a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; and he is left as the Odd Man Out.
He giggles.
Schikaneder calls out to Leopold from the keyboard.
SCHIKANEDER Herr Mozart, why don't you name your son's penalty?
Applause.
MOZART Yes, Papa, name it.
MOZART Name it.
MOZART I'll do anything you say!
LEOPOLD I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
SCHIKANEDER What did he say?
SCHIKANEDER What did he say?
MOZART Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
LEOPOLD I'm tired of this game.
LEOPOLD Please play without me.
MOZART But my penalty.
MOZART I've got to have a penalty.
All the bystanders are watching.
SCHIKANEDER I've got a good one.
SCHIKANEDER I've got the perfect one for you.
SCHIKANEDER Come over here.
Mozart runs over to the forte-piano, and Schikaneder surrenders his place at it.
SCHIKANEDER Now, I want you to play our tune - sitting backwards.
Applause.
MOZART Oh, that's really too easy.
MOZART Any child can do that.
Amused sounds of disbelief.
SCHIKANEDER And a fugue in the manner of Sebastian Bach.
Renewed applause at this wicked extra penalty.
Mozart smiles at Schikaneder - it is the sort of challenge he loves.
He defiantly puts on Constanze's wig and seats himself with his back to the keyboard.
Before the astonished eyes of the company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task.
His right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble, and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been dancing.
Attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer to the instrument.
So does Salieri, cautiously, with some of the bystanders.
Constanze watches him approach.
Only Leopold sits by himself, sulking.
The fugue ends amidst terrific clapping.
The guests call out to Mozart.
GUESTS Another!
GUESTS Do another!
GUESTS Someone else.
MOZART Give me a name.
MOZART Who shall I do?
MOZART Give me a name.
GUESTS Gluck!
GUESTS Haydn!
GUESTS Frederic Handel!
CONSTANZE Salieri!
CONSTANZE Do Salieri!
SMASH CUT: Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her.
MOZART Now that's hard.
MOZART That's very hard.
MOZART For Salieri one has to face the right way around.
Giggling, he turns around and sits at the keyboard.
Then, watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody.
He furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his eyes.
Then he begins to play the tune to which they danced, in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and dominant, endlessly repeated.
The music is the very essence of banality.
The bystanders rock with laughter.
Mozart starts to giggle wildly.
Through this excruciating scene, Salieri stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks challengingly back at him.
Mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a fart noise instead of notes to end cadences.
He builds this up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly he stops and cries out.
The laughter cuts off.
Mozart stands up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his breeches.
The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl of laughter.
CU, Salieri staring in pain.
CU, The old man is shaking at the very recollection of his humiliation.
OLD SALIERI Go on.
OLD SALIERI Mock me.
OLD SALIERI Laugh, laugh!
A repetition of the shot of Mozart at the forte-piano, wearing Constanze's wig and emitting a shrill giggle.
Salieri sits at his desk.
He holds in his hand the small black party mask and stares in hatred at the place on the wall where the crucifix used to hang.
Faintly we see the mark of the cross.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) That was not Mozart laughing, Father.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) That was God.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) That was God!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) God laughing at me through that obscene giggle.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Go on, Signore.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Laugh.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Rub my nose in it.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Show my mediocrity for all to see.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) You wait!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) I will laugh at You!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Before I leave this earth, I will laugh at You!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Amen!
It is littered with manuscripts.
In the middle stands a billiard table.
The beautiful closing ensemble from Act IV of Figaro: Ah, Tutti contenti!
Saremo cosi plays in the background.
Standing at the billiard table, Mozart is dreamily hearing the music and playing shots on the table.
From time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript paper and jots down notes.
He is very much in his own world of composition and the billiard balls are an aid to creation.
Presently, however, we hear a knocking at the door.
CONSTANZE Wolfi!
CONSTANZE Wolfgang!
The music breaks off.
MOZART What is it?
He opens the door.
CONSTANZE There's a young girl to see you.
MOZART What does she want?
CONSTANZE I don't know.
MOZART Well, ask her!
CONSTANZE She won't talk to me.
CONSTANZE She says she has to speak to you.
MOZART Oh, damn!
Mozart comes out.
Framed in the doorway from outside stands Lorl, the maid we noticed in Salieri's house.
From his bedroom Leopold peeps out to watch.
Mozart goes to the girl.
Constanze follows.
MOZART Yes?
LORL Are you Herr Mozart?
MOZART That's right.
LORL My name is Lorl, sir.
LORL I'm a maidservant.
LORL I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
MOZART What?
LORL They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
CONSTANZE What do you mean?
CONSTANZE What admirer?
LORL I can't tell you that, ma'am.
MOZART Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
LORL Yes.
LORL I can live in or out just as you wish.
Mozart turns to his father.
MOZART Papa, is this your idea?
LEOPOLD Mine?
The old man emerges from his bedroom.
His son looks at him delightedly.
MOZART Are you playing a trick on me?
LEOPOLD I never saw this girl in my life.
LEOPOLD Is this a kind of joke?
LORL Not at all, sir.
LORL And I was told to wait for an answer.
LEOPOLD Young woman, this won't do at all.
LEOPOLD My son can't possibly accept such an offer, no matter how generous, unless he knows who is behind it.
LORL But I really can't tell you, sir.
LEOPOLD Oh, this is ridiculous.
CONSTANZE What is ridiculous?
CONSTANZE Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna.
CONSTANZE They love him here.
CONSTANZE People send us gifts all the time.
LEOPOLD But you can't take her without reference.
LEOPOLD It's unheard of!
CONSTANZE Well, this is none of your business.
CONSTANZE Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
LORL That's right, ma'am.
LEOPOLD So now we are going to let a perfect stranger into the house?
Constanze looks furiously at him, then at Lorl.
CONSTANZE Who is we?
CONSTANZE Who is letting who?
CONSTANZE Could you please wait outside?
LORL Yes, ma'am.
Lorl goes outside and closes the door.
Constanze turns on Leopold.
CONSTANZE Look, old man, you stay out of this.
CONSTANZE We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night.
CONSTANZE And then you think you can -
MOZART Stanzi!
CONSTANZE No, it's right he should hear.
CONSTANZE I'm sick to death of it.
CONSTANZE We can't do anything right for you, can we?
LEOPOLD Never mind.
LEOPOLD You won't have to do anything for me ever again.
LEOPOLD I'm leaving!
MOZART Papa!
LEOPOLD Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
MOZART No one calls you that.
LEOPOLD She does.
LEOPOLD She says I sleep all day.
CONSTANZE And so you do!
CONSTANZE The only time you come out is to eat.
LEOPOLD And what do you expect?
LEOPOLD Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
CONSTANZE Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
LEOPOLD So you are!
LEOPOLD The place is a pigsty all the time.
CONSTANZE Do you hear him?
CONSTANZE Do you?
Explosively she opens the door.
CONSTANZE When can you start?
LORL Right away, ma'am.
CONSTANZE Good!
CONSTANZE Come in.
CONSTANZE You'll start with that room there.
CONSTANZE It's filthy!
She leads the maid into Leopold's room.
Mozart steals back into his workroom and gently closes the door.
Leopold is left alone.
LEOPOLD Sorry, sorry!
LEOPOLD I'm sorry I spoke!
LEOPOLD I'm just a provincial from Salzburg.
LEOPOLD What do I know about smart Vienna?
LEOPOLD Parties all night, every night.
LEOPOLD Dancing and drinking like idiot children!
Mozart stands trying to blot out the noise of his father's shouting from the next room.
LEOPOLD Dinner at eight!
LEOPOLD Dinner at ten!
LEOPOLD Dinner when anyone feels like it!
LEOPOLD If anyone feels like it!
The ensemble of Ah, Tutti contenti!
Saremo cosi from Act IV of Figaro resumes, coming to his aid and rising to greet the listener with its serene harmonies.
Relieved, Mozart languidly picks up his cue and plays a shot on the billiard table: he is sucked back into his own world of sound.
The music fades.
We see Lorl, dressed in a walking cloak, sitting before a desk, talking to someone confidentially.
LORL They're out every night, sir.
LORL Till all hours.
A hand comes into frame offering a plate of sugared biscuits.
On its finger we see the gold signet ring belonging to Salieri.
LORL Oh, thank you, sir.
SALIERI Do any pupils come to the house?
LORL Not that I've seen.
SALIERI Then how does he pay for all this?
SALIERI Does he work at all?
LORL Oh, yes, sir, all day long.
LORL He never leaves the house until evening.
LORL He just sits there, writing and writing.
LORL He doesn't even eat.
SALIERI Really?
SALIERI What is it he's writing?
LORL Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
SALIERI Of course not.
SALIERI You're a good girl.
SALIERI You're very kind to do this.
SALIERI Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
Confused, the girl hesitates.
He hands her a pile of coins.
LORL Oh, thank you, sir!
She accepts them, delighted.
The final movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto in E-flat (K.
482) begins.
To its lively music, the door of the house bursts open and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried out of it by six men, who run off with it down the street.
Following them immediately appear Wolfgang, Constanze and Leopold, all three dressed for an occasion.
They climb into a waiting carriage which drives off after the forte-piano.
As soon as it goes, Lorl appears in the doorway, peering slyly around to see that they are out of sight.
Then she shuts the door and hurries off in the opposite direction.
An outdoor concert is being given.
Mozart is actually playing the final movement of his E-flat concerto with an orchestra.
Listening to him is a sizable audience, including the Emperor, flanked by Strack and Von Swieten.
The crowd is in a happy and appreciative mood: it is a delightful open-air scene.
We hear the gayest and most complex passage.
Leopold and Constanze listen to Mozart, who plays his own work brilliantly.
We stay with this scene for a little while and then
A carriage clopping through the streets.
Lorl is sitting up on the box beside the driver.
Inside the vehicle, we glimpse the figure of Salieri.
We hear more of the concerto.
Perhaps the slow interlude in the last movement of K. 482.
Mozart is conducting and playing in a reflective mood.
Abruptly we
Lorl is opening the door admitting Salieri.
They go in.
The door shuts.
The room is considerably tidier as a result of Lorl's ministrations.
Salieri stands looking about him with tremendous curiosity.
LORL I think I've found out about the money, sir.
SALIERI Yes what?
She opens a drawer in a sideboard.
Inside we see one gold snuff box: it is the one we saw Mozart being presented with as a child in the Vatican.
LORL He kept seven snuff boxes in here.
LORL I could swear they were all gold.
LORL And now look there's only one left.
LORL And inside, sir, look - I counted them - tickets from the pawnshop.
LORL Six of them.
Salieri turns to look around him.
SALIERI Where does he work?
LORL In there, sir.
She points across the room to the workroom.
Salieri crosses and goes in alone.
Salieri enters the private quarters of Amadeus.
He is immensely excited.
He moves slowly into the 'holy of holies' picking up objects with great reverence - a billiard ball; a discarded wig; a sock; a buckle - then objects more important to him.
Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts, he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather.
He touches the inkstand.
He lays a finger on the candlestick with its half-expired candle.
He touches each object as if it were the memento of a beloved.
He is in awe.
Finally his eye falls on the sheets of music themselves.
Stealthily he picks them up.
CU, The pages.
We see words set to music.
Against each line of notes is the name of a character: Contessa, Susanna, Cherubino.
Then another page - the title page - written in Mozart's hand.
Le Nozze di Figaro Comedia per musica tratta dal Francese in quattro atti.
CU, The word Figaro.
CU, Salieri.
He stares amazed.
Mozart is playing the cadenza and coda of Piano Concerto (K.
482).
He completes the work with a flourish.
There is loud applause.
The Emperor rises and all follow suit.
Mozart comes down to be greeted by him.
JOSEPH Bravo, Mozart.
JOSEPH Most charming.
JOSEPH Yes, indeed.
JOSEPH Clever man.
MOZART Thank you, Sire!
VON SWIETEN Well done, Mozart.
VON SWIETEN Really quite fine.
MOZART Baron!
He sees his wife and father standing by in the crowd.
Leopold is signaling insistently.
MOZART Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
JOSEPH What is it?
MOZART May I introduce my father?
MOZART He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg.
MOZART He would so much like to kiss your hand.
MOZART It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
JOSEPH Ah!
JOSEPH By all means.
Leopold comes forward eagerly and fawningly kisses the royal hand.
LEOPOLD Your Majesty.
Constanze curtsies.
JOSEPH Good evening.
JOSEPH We have met before, Herr Mozart.
LEOPOLD That's right, Your Majesty.
LEOPOLD Twenty years ago.
LEOPOLD No, twenty-two!
LEOPOLD twenty- three!
LEOPOLD And I remember word for word what you said to me.
LEOPOLD You said - you said --
He searches his memory.
JOSEPH Bravo?
LEOPOLD No!
LEOPOLD Yes, 'bravo,' of course 'bravo'!
LEOPOLD Everybody always says 'bravo' when Wolfi plays.
LEOPOLD Like the King of England.
LEOPOLD When we played for the King of England, he got up at the end and said, 'Bravo!
LEOPOLD Bravo!
LEOPOLD Bravo!' three times.
LEOPOLD Three bravo's.
LEOPOLD And the Pope four!
LEOPOLD Four bravo's from the Holy Father, and one 'bellissimo.'
All the courtiers around are looking at him.
MOZART Father -
LEOPOLD Hush!
LEOPOLD I'm talking to His Majesty.
LEOPOLD Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers.
LEOPOLD It is not for nothing that
the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
JOSEPH Ah-ha.
JOSEPH Well.
JOSEPH There it is.
The Director sits at his table with Salieri and Bonno.
SALIERI I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Yes?
SALIERI Mozart is writing a new opera.
SALIERI An Italian opera.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Italian?
BONNO Aie!
SALIERI And that's not all.
SALIERI He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.
SALIERI The Marriage of Figaro.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG You mean that play?
SALIERI Exactly.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG He's setting that play to music?
SALIERI Yes.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG You must be mad.
BONNO What is this Marriage of Figaro?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG It's a French play, Kapellmeister.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG It has been banned by the Emperor.
BONNO Hah!
He crosses himself, wide-eyed with alarm.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Are you absolutely sure?
SALIERI I've seen the manuscript.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Where?
SALIERI Never mind.
VON STRACK I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why.
VON STRACK Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
VON STRACK Oh yes, yes.
VON STRACK And that was?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Do you see the implications?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
VON STRACK Ah.
The Emperor stands in the middle of the room in close conversation with Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Von Swieten, and Bonno.
Salieri is not present.
A door opens and a lackey announces:
LACKEY Herr Mozart.
They all turn.
Mozart approaches, rather apprehensively, and kisses Joseph's hand.
JOSEPH Sit down, gentlemen, please.
They all sit, save Mozart.
The room suddenly looks like a tribunal.
Joseph is in a serious mood.
JOSEPH Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
MOZART Yes, Sire.
JOSEPH Yet we hear you are making an opera from it.
JOSEPH Is this true?
MOZART Who told you this, Majesty?
JOSEPH It is not your place to ask questions.
JOSEPH Is it true?
MOZART Well, yes, I admit it is.
JOSEPH Would you tell me why?
MOZART Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
MOZART But, Your Majesty -
JOSEPH Mozart, I am a tolerant man.
JOSEPH I do not censor things lightly.
JOSEPH When I do, I have good reason.
JOSEPH Figaro is a bad play.
JOSEPH It stirs up hatred between the classes.
JOSEPH In France it has caused nothing but bitterness.
JOSEPH My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people.
JOSEPH I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
MOZART Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story.
MOZART I have taken out everything that could give offense.
MOZART I hate politics.
JOSEPH I think you are rather innocent, my friend.
JOSEPH In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
The others look at their king solemnly, all save Mozart.
MOZART But, Majesty, this is just a frolic.
MOZART It's a piece about love.
JOSEPH Ah, love again.
MOZART But it's new, it's entirely new.
MOZART It's so new, people will go mad for it.
MOZART For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling.
MOZART Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation.
MOZART Duet turns into trio.
MOZART Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in.
MOZART Trio turns into quartet.
MOZART Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.
MOZART On and on, sextet, septet, octet!
MOZART How long do you think I can sustain that?
JOSEPH I have no idea.
MOZART Guess!
MOZART Guess, Majesty.
MOZART Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
JOSEPH Well, six or seven minutes!
JOSEPH maybe eight!
MOZART Twenty, sire!
MOZART How about twenty?
MOZART Twenty minutes of continuous music.
MOZART No recitatives.
VON SWIETEN Mozart -
MOZART Sire, only opera can do this.
MOZART In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise.
MOZART No one can understand a word.
MOZART But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony.
MOZART Isn't that marvelous?
VON SWIETEN Mozart, music is not the issue here.
VON SWIETEN No one doubts your talent.
VON SWIETEN It is your judgment of literature that's in question.
VON SWIETEN Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce.
VON SWIETEN Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
VON SWIETEN Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
MOZART Elevated?
MOZART What does that mean?
MOZART Elevated!
MOZART The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me.
MOZART I'm sorry.
MOZART I'm stupid.
MOZART But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things!
MOZART Old dead legends!
MOZART How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
VON SWIETEN Because they do.
VON SWIETEN They go on forever - at least what they represent.
VON SWIETEN The eternal in us, not the ephemeral.
VON SWIETEN Opera is here to ennoble us.
VON SWIETEN You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
BONNO Bello!
BONNO Bello, Barone.
BONNO Veramente.
MOZART Oh, bello, bello, bello!
MOZART Come on now, be honest.
MOZART Wouldn't you all rather listen to your hairdressers than Hercules?
MOZART Or Horatius?
MOZART Or Orpheus?
MOZART All those old bores!
MOZART people so lofty they sound as if they shit marble!
VON SWIETEN What?
VON STRACK Govern your tongue, sir!
VON STRACK How dare you?
Beat.
All look at the Emperor.
MOZART Forgive me, Majesty.
MOZART I'm a vulgar man.
MOZART But I assure you, my music is not.
JOSEPH You are passionate, Mozart!
JOSEPH But you do not persuade.
MOZART Sire, the whole opera is finished.
MOZART Do you know how much work went into it?
BONNO His Majesty has been more than patient, Signore.
MOZART How can I persuade you if you won't let me show it?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG That will do, Herr Mozart!
MOZART Just let me tell you how it begins.
VON STRACK Herr Mozart -
MOZART May I just do that, Majesty?
MOZART Show you how it begins?
MOZART Just that?
A slight pause.
Then Joseph nods.
JOSEPH Please.
Mozart falls on his knees.
MOZART Look!
MOZART There's a servant, down on his knees.
MOZART Do you know why?
MOZART Not from any oppression.
MOZART No, he's simply measuring a space.
MOZART Do you know what for?
MOZART His bed.
MOZART His wedding bed to see if it will fit.
He giggles.
Mozart sits on stage at a harpsichord rehearsing the singers taking the parts of Figaro and Susanna in the opening bars of the first act of The Marriage of Figaro.
We watch Figaro measuring the space for his bed on the floor, singing and Susanna looking on, trying on the Countess' hat.
Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno are sitting with Salieri.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
SALIERI Incredible.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG The Emperor has given him permission.
BONNO Si, si!
BONNO Veramente.
SALIERI Well, gentlemen, so be it.
SALIERI In that case I think we should help Mozart all we can and do our best to protect him against the Emperor's anger.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG What anger?
SALIERI About the ballet.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Ballet?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG What ballet?
SALIERI Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Yes, absolutely.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Is there a ballet in Figaro?
SALIERI Yes, in the third act.
It is a full orchestral rehearsal.
Mozart is conducting from the harpsichord with his hands; he does not use a baton.
The singers are all in practice clothes, not costumes.
We are in the Act III and we hear the recitativo exchange just before the march begins.
Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno sit watching chairs.
Suddenly the march starts.
Peasants and friends start to dance in and at the same moment, Orsini-Rosenberg gets up and comes down to Mozart.
He is accompanied by an anxious Bonno.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Mozart!
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Right away.
MOZART Certainly, Herr Director.
He signals to the cast to break off.
MOZART Five minutes, please!
The company disperses, curious.
The musicians look at Orsini- Rosenberg.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
MOZART Yes, but this is not a ballet.
MOZART This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Exactly.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG A dance.
MOZART But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Give me your score, please.
Mozart hands him the score from which he is conducting.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Thank you.
He rips out a page.
Bonno watches in terror.
MOZART What are you doing?
He rips out three more.
MOZART What are you doing, Herr Director?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Taking out what you should never have put in.
He goes on tearing the pages determinedly.
A servant opens the door to announce.
SERVANT Herr Mozart.
Mozart brushes past him straight towards Salieri, who rises to greet him.
The little man is near hysterics.
MOZART Please!
MOZART Please.
MOZART I've no one else to turn to.
MOZART Please!
He grabs Salieri.
SALIERI Wolfgang, what is it?
SALIERI Sta calmo, per favore.
SALIERI What's the matter?
MOZART It's unbelievable!
MOZART The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music.
MOZART Pages of it.
SALIERI Really?
SALIERI Why?
MOZART I don't know.
MOZART They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is.
MOZART I can't rewrite what's perfect.
MOZART Can't you talk to him?
SALIERI Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg?
SALIERI He's obviously no friend of yours.
MOZART Oh, I could kill him!
MOZART I mean really kill him.
MOZART I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
SALIERI You burned the score?
MOZART Oh no!
MOZART My wife took it out in time.
SALIERI How fortunate.
MOZART It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
SALIERI But there are those who have power over him.
SALIERI I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
MOZART Oh, Excellency, would you?
SALIERI With all my heart, Mozart.
MOZART Thank you!
MOZART Oh, thank you.
He kisses Salieri's hand.
SALIERI No, no, no, Herr Mozart, please.
SALIERI It's not a holy relic.
Mozart giggles with relief and gratitude.
OLD SALIERI I'm sure I don't need to tell you I said nothing whatever to the Emperor.
OLD SALIERI I went to the theatre ready to tell Mozart that His Majesty had flown into a rage when I mentioned the ballet, when suddenly, to my astonishment, in the middle of the third act, the Emperor - who never attended rehearsals - suddenly appeared.
In the background the same recitativo before the March.
The Emperor steals in surreptitiously with Von Strack, his finger to his lips.
He motions everyone not to rise, and slips into a chair behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno.
The three conspirators look at each other wide-eyed.
The recitativo summons up the march, but instead there is silence.
Mozart lays down his baton.
The musicians lay down their instruments.
The celebrants of Figaro's wedding come in with a few pitiful dance steps, in procession, only to come presently to a halt, lacking their music.
The singers try to go on singing, but they have no cues from their conductor or from the accompaniment.
Everyone on stage looks lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while.
Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators.
Mozart glances back at the group seated in the theatre.
Finally, the Emperor speaks, in a whisper.
JOSEPH What is this?
JOSEPH I don't understand.
JOSEPH Is it modern?
BONNO Majesty, the Herr Director, he has removed a balleto that would have occurred at this place.
JOSEPH Why?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG It is your regulation, Sire.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG No ballet in your opera.
Mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot.
JOSEPH Do you like this, Salieri?
SALIERI It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty.
SALIERI Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
JOSEPH Well, look at them.
We do look at them.
The spectacle on stage has now ground to a complete halt.
JOSEPH No, no, no!
JOSEPH This is nonsense.
JOSEPH Let me hear the scene with the music.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG But, Sire -
JOSEPH Oblige me.
Orsini-Rosenberg acknowledges his defeat.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Yes, Majesty.
Orsini-Rosenberg rises and goes down to where Mozart sits anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
MOZART Oh yes, certainly.
MOZART Certainly, Herr Director!
He looks back deliriously at Salieri, trying to indicate his gratitude.
Salieri acknowledges with a slight and subtle nod.
Orsini-Rosenberg returns to his king.
MOZART Ladies and gentlemen, we're going
from where we stopped.
The Count: Anches so.
Right away, please!
The singers scatter offstage to begin the scene again.
JOSEPH What I hoped by that edict, Director, was simply to prevent hours of dancing like in French opera.
JOSEPH There it is endless, as you know.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG Quite so, Majesty.
CUT BACK TO Mozart at the forte-piano, raising his hands.
The musicians raise their bows.
With a flourish the happy composer begins a reprise of the scene which had been cut out.
The music of the march begins faintly; the celebrants of Figaro's wedding start to enter as the Count and the Countess sit in their chairs.
In the theatre we see increasing pleasure on the Emperor's face, sullenness and defeat on the courtiers'.
Then, suddenly, without interruption, on a crescendo repeat of the march, we
The theatre is brilliantly lit for the first public performance of Figaro.
Everybody is there: the Emperor, Von Strack, Bonno Orsini-Rosenberg, Von Swieten, even Madame Weber and her daughters in a box.
The musicians all wear imperial livery; the actors on stage are now in costume.
Mozart, conducting, wears his Order of the Golden Spur.
The company wheels in and around to the music of the restored march, which reaches a triumphant climax.
OLD SALIERI So Figaro was produced in spite of me.
OLD SALIERI And in spite of me, a wonder was revealed.
OLD SALIERI One of the true wonders of art.
OLD SALIERI The restored third act was bold and brilliant.
OLD SALIERI The fourth was a miracle.
The descending scale of strings in the final ensemble (Ah, Tutti contenti.
Saremo cosi) fades in.
We see the tableau on stage with the Count kneeling to the Countess.
All are singing.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) I saw a woman disguised in her maid's clothes hear her husband speak the first tender words he has offered her in years, only because he thinks she is someone else.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) I heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theatre, conferring on all who sat there a perfect absolution.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) God was singing through this little man to all the world - unstoppable - making my defeat more bitter with each passing bar.
CU, Salieri in his box, tears on his cheeks.
He watches the ensemble and we listen to it for a long moment.
Finally it fades, but continues underneath the following:
OLD SALIERI And then suddenly - a miracle!
The ensemble reaches its climax, and fades away to the very quiet, slow chords immediately preceding the boisterous final chord.
Salieri becomes aware that some of the audience are asleep and many mare are apathetic.
In the near silence we see the Emperor yawn behind his hand.
Those nearby look at him.
Orsini-Rosenberg smiles.
OLD SALIERI Father, did you know what that meant?
OLD SALIERI With that yawn I saw my defeat turn into a victory.
OLD SALIERI And Mozart was lucky the Emperor only yawned once.
OLD SALIERI Three yawns and the opera would fail the same night; two yawns, within a week at most.
OLD SALIERI With one yawn the composer could still get -
Mozart is pacing up and down.
Salieri is listening sympathetically.
MOZART Nine performances!
MOZART Nine!
MOZART That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
SALIERI I know; it's outrageous.
SALIERI Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
MOZART But what is it they don't like?
SALIERI Well, I can speak for the Emperor.
SALIERI You made too many demands on the royal ear.
SALIERI The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
MOZART What did you think of it yourself?
MOZART Did you like it at all?
SALIERI I think it's marvelous.
SALIERI Truly.
MOZART It's the best opera yet written.
MOZART I know it!
MOZART Why didn't they come?
SALIERI I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend.
SALIERI Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
MOZART I know, I know.
MOZART Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
SALIERI I wouldn't presume.
SALIERI All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece.
SALIERI It would be a tremendous honour for me.
MOZART Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
SALIERI Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
MOZART Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
He bows too, giggling.
A performance of Salieri's grand opera, Axur: King of Ormus.
Deafening applause from a crowded house.
We see the reception of the aria which we saw Cavalieri singing on the stage near the start of the film.
Cavalieri, in a mythological Persian costume, is bowing to the rapturous throng; below her is Salieri.
We see the Emperor, Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and Von Swieten, all applauding.
We hear great cries of 'Salieri!
Salieri!' and 'Bravo!' and 'Brava!'
CU, Salieri looking at the crowd with immense pleasure.
Then suddenly at:
CU, Mozart standing in a box and clapping wildly.
Behind him, seated, are Schikaneder and the three girls we saw before in Mozart's apartment.
CU, Salieri staring fixedly at Mozart, then Mozart still clapping, apparently with tremendous enthusiasm.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) What was this?
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) I never saw him excited before by any music but his own.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Could he mean it?
OLD SALIERI Would he actually tell me my music had moved him?
OLD SALIERI Was I really going to hear that from his own lips?
OLD SALIERI I found myself actually hurrying the tempo of the finale.
Salieri conducting the last scene from Axur: King of Ormus.
On stage we see a big scene of acclamation: the hero and heroine of the opera accepting the crown amidst the rejoicing of the people.
The decor and costumes are mythological Persian.
The music is utterly conventional and totally uninventive.
CU, Mozart watching this in his box, with Schikaneder and the three actresses.
He passes an open bottle of wine to them.
He is evidently a little drunk, but keeps a poker face.
The act comes to an end.
Great applause in which Mozart joins in, standing and shouting 'Bravo!
Bravo!' Then he leaves the box with Schikaneder and the girls.
MOZART Well?
SCHIKANEDER Sublime!
SCHIKANEDER Utterly sublime!
MOZART That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Schikaneder laughs.
A crowd of people rings Salieri at a respectful distance.
The Emperor is holding out the Civilian Medal and Chain.
JOSEPH I believe that is the best opera yet written, my friends.
JOSEPH Salieri, you are the brightest star in the musical firmament.
JOSEPH You do honour to Vienna and to me.
Salieri bows his head.
Joseph places the chain around his neck.
The crowd claps.
Salieri makes to kiss his hand, but Joseph restrains him, and passes on.
Cavalieri, smiling adoringly, gives him a deep curtsey, and he raises her up.
The crowd all flock to Salieri with cries and words of approval.
All want to shake his hand.
They tug and pat him.
But he has eyes for only one man - he looks about him, searching for him and then finds him.
Mozart stands there.
Eagerly Salieri moves to him.
SALIERI Mozart.
SALIERI It was good of you to come.
MOZART How could I not?
SALIERI Did my work please you?
MOZART How could it not, Excellency?
SALIERI Yes?
MOZART I never knew that music like that was possible.
SALIERI You flatter me.
MOZART Oh no!
MOZART One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
Salieri smiles.
Explosive laughter as Mozart and Schikaneder enter the apartment, very pleased with themselves and accompanied by the three actresses.
The front door opens, very gingerly.
Mozart, still rather drunk, sticks his head into the room, anxious not to make a noise.
He sees the strangers and breaks into a smile.
MOZART Oh.
MOZART Everybody's here!
MOZART We've got guests.
MOZART Good.
MOZART I've brought some more.
He opens the door wide to admit Schikaneder and the girls.
MOZART We'll have a little party.
MOZART Come in.
MOZART Come in.
MOZART You know Herr Schikaneder?
MOZART This is!
MOZART a very nice girl.
CONSTANZE Wolfi.
MOZART Yes, my love?
CONSTANZE These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
MOZART Salzburg.
MOZART We were just talking about Salzburg.
MOZART If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment.
MOZART Because I've got good news for him.
MOZART I'm done with Vienna.
MOZART It's over, finished, done with!
MOZART Done with!
MOZART Done with!
CONSTANZE Wolfi!
CONSTANZE Your father is dead.
MOZART What?
CONSTANZE Your father is dead.
The first loud chord of the Statue scene from Don Giovanni sounds.
Mozart stares.
The second chord sounds.
On stage we see the huge figure of the Commendatore in robes and helmet, extending his arms and pointing in accusation.
The second chord sounds.
On stage we see a huge nailed fist crash through the wall of a painted dining room set.
The giant armoured statue of the COMMENDATORE enters pointing his finger in accusation at Don Giovanni who sits at the supper table, staring - his servant Leporello quaking with fear under the table.
THE COMMENDATORE Don Giovanni!
The figure advances on the libertine.
We see Mozart conducting, pale and deeply involved.
Music fades down a little.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) So rose the dreadful ghost in his next and blackest opera.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) There on the stage stood the figure of a dead commander calling out 'Repent!
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Repent!'
The music swells.
We see Salieri standing alone in the back of a box, unseen, in semi-darkness.
We also see that the theatre is only half full.
Music fades down.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) And I knew - only I understood - that the horrifying apparition was Leopold, raised from the dead.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father to accuse his son before all the world.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) It was terrifying and wonderful to watch.
Music swells up again.
We watch the scene on stage as the Commendatore addresses Giovanni.
Then back to Salieri in the box.
Music down again.
OLD SALIERI Now a madness began in me.
OLD SALIERI The madness of a man splitting in half.
OLD SALIERI Through my influence I saw to it Don Giovanni was played only five times in Vienna.
OLD SALIERI But in secret I went to every one of those five - all alone - unable to help myself, worshipping sound I alone seemed to hear.
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) And hour after hour, as I stood there, understanding even more clearly how that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son from beyond the grave, I began to see a way - a terrible way - I could finally triumph over God, my torturer.
Music swells.
On stage Don Giovanni is seized and gripped by the Statue's icy hand.
Flames burst from obviously artificial rocks.
Demons appear and drag the libertine down to Hell.
The scene ends.
CU, Salieri, staring wide-eyed.
We see huge and attractive posters and billboards advertising Schikaneder's troupe.
The camera concentrates on the one which reads as follows:
EMMANUEL SCHIKANEDER Impresario de luxe
PRESENTS The Celebrated
IN An Evening of
PARODY Music!
PARODY Mirth!
PARODY Magic!
who personally will appear in every scene!
Noise; smoke; the audience is sitting at tables for an evening of vaudeville.
Mozart, Constanze and their son Karl, now about two years old, and sitting on his mother's lap, are watching a parody scene by Schikaneder's troupe.
They are rowdy, bawdy and silly, incorporating motifs, situations and tunes from Mozart's operas which we have seen and heard.
Before them on the table are bottles of wine and beer, plates of sausages, etc.
On stage we see a set which parodies the dining room in Don Giovanni's palace, shown before.
Schikaneder as Don Giovanni is dancing with the three actresses to the minuet from Don Giovanni (end of Act I), played by a quartet of tipsy musicians.
Leporello is handing around wine on a tray.
Suddenly there is a tremendous knocking from outside.
The music slithers to a stop.
All look at each other in panic.
Leporello drops his tray with a crash.
All go quiet.
One more knock is heard.
Then all musicians, actresses, Don Giovanni and Leporello make a dash to hide under the table which is far too small to accommodate them all.
The table rocks.
Schikaneder is pushed out.
He is terrified.
He shakes elaborately.
Three more knocks are heard; louder.
SCHIKANEDER Who is it?
One more knock.
SCHIKANEDER C-c-c-come in!
In the pit a chromatic scale from the Overture to Don Giovanni turns into a anticipatory vamp.
This grows more and more menacing until the whole flat representing the wall at the back falls down.
An absurd pantomime horse gallops in.
It has a ridiculous expression, and is manned by four men inside.
Standing precariously on its back is a dwarf, wearing a miniature version of the armour and helmet worn by the Commendatore.
He sings in a high, nasal voice:
COMMENDATORE Don Giovannnnnnnnnni!
He tries to keep his balance as he trots in, but fails.
He falls off onto the stage.
He beats at the horse, trying to get back on.
COMMENDATORE Down!
COMMENDATORE Down!
Bewildered, the horse looks about him, but cannot see his small rider who is below his level of sight.
COMMENDATORE I'm here!
COMMENDATORE I'm here!
The horse, amidst laughter from the audience, fails to locate him.
Exasperated, the dwarf signals to someone in the wings.
A tall man strides out carrying a see-saw; on his shoulders stands another man.
The dwarf stands on the lowered end of the see-saw.
There is a drum roll and the man above jumps down onto the raised end and the Commendatore is abruptly catapulted back onto the horse, only backwards so that he is facing away from Don Giovanni.
The two men bow to the applauding audience, and retire off-stage.
The Commendatore tries to extend his arms in the proper menacing attitude, and at the same time turn around to face Don Giovanni.
This he finds difficult.
COMMENDATORE Don Giovannnnnnnni!
SCHIKANEDER Who the devil are you?
SCHIKANEDER What do you want?
COMMENDATORE I've come to dinnnnnner!
SCHIKANEDER Dinner?
SCHIKANEDER How dare you?
SCHIKANEDER I am a nobleman.
SCHIKANEDER I only dine with people of my own height.
COMMENDATORE Are you drunk?
COMMENDATORE You invited me.
COMMENDATORE And my horse.
COMMENDATORE Here he is.
COMMENDATORE Ottavio!
The horse takes a bow.
The dwarf almost falls off again.
COMMENDATORE Whoa!
COMMENDATORE Whoa!
COMMENDATORE Stop it!
The three girls rush to his aid and reach him just in time.
They sing in the manner of the Tree Ladies later to be put into The Magic Flute.
FIRST LADY Be careful!
SECOND LADY Be careful!
THIRD LADY Be careful!
ALL THREE TOGETHER Hold tight now!
They grab him.
COMMENDATORE Leave me alone!
COMMENDATORE Stop it!
COMMENDATORE I'm a famous horseman.
OTTAVIO And I'm a famous horse!
He gives the ladies a radiant smile.
The three ladies sing, as before, in close harmony.
FIRST LADY He's adorable!
SECOND LADY Adorable!
THIRD LADY Adorable!
An orchestral chord.
The three ladies turn to Ottavio and sing to him.
THREE LADIES Give me your hoof, my darling, And I'll give you my heart!
THREE LADIES Take me to your stable, And never more we'll part!
OTTAVIO I'm shy and very bashful.
OTTAVIO I don't know what to say.
THREE LADIES Don't hesitate a second.
THREE LADIES Just answer yes and neigh.
Ottavio neighs loudly, and runs at the girls.
COMMENDATORE Stop it.
COMMENDATORE What are you doing?
COMMENDATORE Remember who you are!
COMMENDATORE You're a horse and they are whores.
Boos from the audience.
SCHIKANEDER This is ridiculous.
SCHIKANEDER I won't have any of it.
SCHIKANEDER You're turning my house into a circus!
A trapeze sails in from above.
On it stands a grand soprano wearing an elaborate Turkish costume, like a parody of Cavalieri's in Il Seraglio.
She comes in singing a mad coloratura scale in the manner of Martern aller Arten.
SCHIKANEDER Shut up.
SCHIKANEDER Women, women, women!
SCHIKANEDER I'm sick to death of them.
He marches off stage.
SOPRANO Dash me!
SOPRANO Bash me!
SOPRANO Lash me!
SOPRANO Flay me!
SOPRANO Slay me!
SOPRANO At last I will be freed by death!
COMMENDATORE Shut up.
SOPRANO Kill me!
SOPRANO Kill me!
SOPRANO Kill me!
SOPRANO Kill me!
SOPRANO At last I shall be freed by death.
SOPRANO At last I shall be freed by dea -
The Commendatore pulls out his sword, reaches up and thrusts her through with it.
The soprano collapses on the bar of the trapeze.
The audience applauds.
At the same moment eight dwarves march in bearing a huge cauldron of steaming water.
They sing as they march to the sound of the march that was cut from Act III of Figaro.
They are dressed as miniature copies of the chorus in that scene except that they are wearing cooks' hats.
EIGHT DWARVES We're going to make a soprano stew!
EIGHT DWARVES We're going to make a soprano stew!
EIGHT DWARVES And when you make a soprano stew!
EIGHT DWARVES Any stupid soprano will do!
EIGHT DWARVES Any stew- stew-stew-stew-stew!
EIGHT DWARVES Any stewpid soprano will do!
They set the giant pot down in the middle of the stage.
The trapeze with the dead soprano is still swinging above the stage.
We hear the chromatic scale from the Don Giovanni overture again, repeated and repeated, only now fast and tremolando.
To this exciting vamp Schikaneder suddenly rides in on a real horse, waving a real sword.
With this he cuts the string of the trapeze, and the soprano falls into the pot.
A tremendous splash of water.
Schikaneder rides out.
More applause.
All the dwarves produce long wooden cooking spoons and climb up the sides of the pot.
The three girls produce labeled bottles from under their skirts.
The first is SALT.
FIRST LADY Behold!
SECOND LADY Behold!
She sneezes.
THIRD LADY Behold!
She hiccups.
They throw them into the pot.
COMMENDATORE How long does it take to cook a soprano?
DWARVES Five hours, five minutes, five seconds.
COMMENDATORE I can't wait that long.
COMMENDATORE I'm starving!
OTTAVIO So am I.
Schikaneder marches in as Figaro.
SCHIKANEDER In the pot, I have got a good dinner.
SCHIKANEDER Not a sausage or stew, but a singer.
SCHIKANEDER Not a sausage or stew but a singer.
SCHIKANEDER Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
COMMENDATORE Oh shut up.
COMMENDATORE I'm sick to death of that tune.
CU, Mozart laughing delightedly with the audience.
THE THREE GIRLS Give me your hoof, my darling, and I'll give you my heart.
COMMENDATORE Shut up.
COMMENDATORE I'm sick of that one too.
All the dwarves climb up the rim of the pot.
As they climb, they all hum together the opening of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.
COMMENDATORE And that one, too!
The soprano rises, dripping with water in the middle of the pot.
SOPRANO Oil me!
SOPRANO Broil me!
SOPRANO Boil me!
All the dwarves beat her back down into the pot with their long wooden spoons.
SOPRANO Soil me!
SOPRANO Foil me!
SOPRANO Spoil me!
HORSE I can't eat her.
HORSE Sopranos give me hiccups.
HORSE I want some hay!
FIRST LADY Hey!
SECOND LADY Hey!
THIRD LADY Hey!
SCHIKANEDER Hey what?
ALL THREE LADIES Give him some hay, my darling, and I'll give you my heart!
COMMENDATORE Shut up.
SCHIKANEDER Leporello!
SCHIKANEDER We want some hay - prestissimo!
SCHIKANEDER Leporello - where are you?
The table is raised in the air by Leporello sitting under it on a bale of hay.
FIRST LADY Behold!
SECOND LADY Behold!
THIRD LADY Behold!
Ottavio the horse gives a piercing neigh and runs down to the hay.
COMMENDATORE Hey!
COMMENDATORE Hey!
COMMENDATORE Watch out!
The vamp starts again vigorously.
The horse's rear-end swings around on a hinge to turn his hind-quarters straight on to the audience.
The rest of him stays sideways.
His tail springs up in the air to reveal a lace handkerchief modestly hiding his arsehole.
Schikaneder offers him a handful of hay.
The horse eats it, and out the other end comes a long Viennese sausage.
The audience roars with laughter.
Another handful of hay and out of the other end falls a string of sausages.
Then a large pie, crust and all.
Then a shower of iced cakes!
Suddenly - silence.
Schikaneder produces an egg from his pocket.
Ottavio the horse rears up in disgust.
COMMENDATORE Whoa!
COMMENDATORE Whoa, Ottavio!
COMMENDATORE Whoa!
Leporello pries open the horse's mouth.
Schikaneder pops the egg into it.
A breathless pause as a drum roll builds the tension, up and up and up, and then suddenly out of the horse's rear-end flies a single white dove.
Wild applause.
It flies into the audience.
Immediately all the cast start humming the lyrical finale from Figaro: Tutti Contenti.
More and more doves fly out from the wings and fill the theatre.
Everybody picks up the sausages and cakes and begins to eat.
The end of the sketch is unexpectedly lyrical and magical, and then, suddenly, the tempo changes and the coarse strains of Ich Mochte wohl Der Kaiser take over and the whole company is dancing, frantically.
A general dance as the curtain falls.
It rises immediately.
The audience - including Mozart - is delighted.
They applaud vigorously.
Schikaneder takes a bow amongst his troupe.
Among much whistling and clapping, he finally jumps off the stage and strides through the audience toward the table where Mozart sits with his family.
On stage, a troupe of bag pipers immediately appears to play an old German tune.
Some of the audience joins in singing it.
SCHIKANEDER Well, how do you like that?
Mozart is smiling; he has been amused.
Constanze has been less amused and is looking apprehensive.
MOZART Wonderful!
MOZART He liked the monkey, didn't you?
SCHIKANEDER Yes, well, it's all good fun.
MOZART I liked the horse.
Schikaneder sits at the table, and drinks from a bottle of wine.
SCHIKANEDER Isn't he marvelous?
SCHIKANEDER He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it.
SCHIKANEDER I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success.
SCHIKANEDER I'm not joking.
SCHIKANEDER These people aren't fools.
SCHIKANEDER You could do something marvelous for them.
MOZART I'd like to try them someday.
MOZART I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
SCHIKANEDER 'Course you would.
SCHIKANEDER You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court.
SCHIKANEDER You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better!
SCHIKANEDER That's what people want, you know: fantasy.
SCHIKANEDER You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want.
SCHIKANEDER Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life.
SCHIKANEDER Oh, and a few trick animals.
SCHIKANEDER You'd have to use those.
MOZART Animals?
SCHIKANEDER I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan.
SCHIKANEDER It's a miracle.
Mozart laughs.
SCHIKANEDER I'm serious.
SCHIKANEDER You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe.
SCHIKANEDER Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
MOZART German!
SCHIKANEDER Of course!
SCHIKANEDER What else do you think they speak here?
MOZART No, no, I love that.
MOZART I'd want it to be in German.
MOZART I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
SCHIKANEDER So there you are.
SCHIKANEDER What do you say?
CONSTANZE How much will you pay him?
SCHIKANEDER Ah.
SCHIKANEDER Well.
SCHIKANEDER Ah,
SCHIKANEDER I see you've got your manager with you.
SCHIKANEDER Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
MOZART Half the receipts!
MOZART Stanzi!
CONSTANZE I'm talking about now.
CONSTANZE How much will you give him now?
CONSTANZE Down payment?
SCHIKANEDER Down payment?
SCHIKANEDER Who do you think I am?
SCHIKANEDER The Emperor?
SCHIKANEDER Whoops, I have to go.
He rises in haste for his next number.
SCHIKANEDER Stay where you are.
SCHIKANEDER You're going to like this next one.
SCHIKANEDER We'll speak again.
SCHIKANEDER Triumph-de-luxe, my boy!
He winks at Mozart and disappears toward the stage.
Mozart looks after him, enchanted.
CONSTANZE You're not going to do this?
MOZART Why not?
MOZART Half the house!
CONSTANZE When?
CONSTANZE We need money now.
CONSTANZE Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
MOZART Oh, Stanzi.
CONSTANZE I don't trust this man.
CONSTANZE And I didn't like what he did with your opera.
CONSTANZE It was common.
MOZART Well, you liked it, didn't you?
MOZART Monkey-flunki-punki.
CONSTANZE Half the house!
CONSTANZE You'll never see a penny.
CONSTANZE I want it here, in my hand.
MOZART Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
CONSTANZE Shut up!
CONSTANZE I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
He giggles like a child.
Dogs are barking wickedly.
Michael Schlumberg comes in from his salon.
Mozart stands there looking very unwell and bewildered.
He is also drunk, but making a careful attempt to keep his composure.
SCHLUMBERG Herr Mozart.
SCHLUMBERG What a surprise.
SCHLUMBERG What can I do for you?
MOZART Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
SCHLUMBERG Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
MOZART Really?
MOZART Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
SCHLUMBERG What is this, Mozart?
SCHLUMBERG What's the matter with you?
MOZART Well.
MOZART Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
SCHLUMBERG What for?
MOZART If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
SCHLUMBERG Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
MOZART No doubt, sir.
MOZART But I am endowed with talent, and you with money.
MOZART If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Pause.
SCHLUMBERG I'm sorry.
SCHLUMBERG No.
MOZART Please.
MOZART I'll give it back, I promise.
MOZART Please, sir.
SCHLUMBERG My answer is no, Mozart.
CU, Mozart.
His voice becomes mechanical.
MOZART Please.
MOZART Please.
MOZART Please.
MOZART Please.
MOZART Please.
MOZART Please.
Von Swieten and Salieri stand close together.
Several scholars and students are examining scrolls and manuscripts at the other end of the room.
VON SWIETEN This is embarrassing, you know.
VON SWIETEN You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them.
VON SWIETEN It has to stop.
SALIERI I agree, Baron.
VON SWIETEN Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him?
VON SWIETEN I've done my best.
VON SWIETEN I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts.
VON SWIETEN He got a fee - what I could afford.
VON SWIETEN Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
SALIERI No, Baron, no.
SALIERI I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause.
SALIERI He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna.
SALIERI He is constantly drunk.
SALIERI He never pays his debts.
SALIERI I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
VON SWIETEN How sad.
VON SWIETEN It's tragic, isn't it?
VON SWIETEN Such a talent.
SALIERI Indeed.
SALIERI Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him.
SALIERI A very appropriate person to do so.
SALIERI Yes.
The opening measures of the Piano Concerto in D Minor steal in.
This is exactly the same shop which Mozart and Constanze visited with Leopold.
Now Salieri's servant stands in it, waiting.
We see a few other customers being served by the staff: renting masks, costumes, etc.
One of the staff emerges from the back of the shop carrying a large box, which he hands to Salieri's servant.
The servant leaves the shop.
Through the window we see him hurrying away through the snowy street full of passers-by, carriages, etc.
The D Minor Concerto continues.
Salieri, alone, eagerly opens the box from the costume shop and takes out the same dark cloak and hat that Leopold wore to the masquerade, only now attached to the hat is a dark mask whose mouth is cut into a frown, not a laugh.
It presents a bitter and menacing expression.
He puts on the cloak, the hat and the mask and turns his back.
Suddenly we see the assembled and alarming image reflected in a full-length mirror.
The music swells darkly.
As the tutti of the D Minor Concerto continues, we see Salieri, dressed in this menacing costume, dark against the snow, stalking through a street which is otherwise lively with people going to various festivities.
Some of them wear frivolous carnival clothes.
Mozart sits writing at a table.
He appears now to be really quite sick.
His face expresses pain from his stomach cramps.
There is a gentle knock at the door.
He rises, goes to he door and opens it.
Immediately there is a SHOCK CUT:
The dark, frowning mask stares at him and at us.
The violent D Minor chord which opens Don Giovanni is heard.
Salieri in costume stands in the doorway.
SALIERI Herr Mozart?
The second chord sounds and fades.
Mozart stares in panic.
SALIERI I have come to commission work from you.
MOZART What work?
SALIERI A Mass for the dead.
MOZART What dead?
MOZART Who is dead?
SALIERI A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
MOZART Who are you?
SALIERI I am only a messenger.
SALIERI Do you accept?
SALIERI You will be paid well.
MOZART How much?
Salieri extends his hand.
In it is a bag of money.
SALIERI Fifty ducats.
SALIERI Another fifty when I have the Mass.
SALIERI Do you accept?
Almost against his will, Mozart takes the money.
MOZART How long will you give me?
SALIERI Work fast.
SALIERI And be sure to tell no one what you do.
SALIERI You will see me again soon.
He turns away.
Mozart closes the front door.
Instantly we hear the opening of the Requiem Mass (also in D Minor).
Mozart turns and looks up at the portrait of his father on the wall.
The portrait stares back.
Constanze opens the door from the bedroom.
She sees him staring up.
CONSTANZE Wolfi?
CONSTANZE Wolfi!
He looks at her with startled eyes.
The music breaks off.
CONSTANZE Who was that?
MOZART No one.
CONSTANZE I heard voices.
He gives a strange little giggle.
CONSTANZE What's the matter?
She sees the bag of money.
CONSTANZE What's that?
CONSTANZE Oh!
CONSTANZE Who gave you this?
CONSTANZE How much is it?
CONSTANZE Wolfi, who gave you this?
MOZART I'm not telling you.
CONSTANZE Why not?
MOZART You'd think I was mad.
He stares at her.
She stares at him.
Old Salieri is now wildly animated, totally driven by his confession to Vogler.
OLD SALIERI My plan was so simple, it terrified me.
OLD SALIERI First I must get the Death Mass and then achieve the death.
Vogler stares at him in horror.
VOGLER What?
OLD SALIERI His funeral - imagine it!
OLD SALIERI The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there.
OLD SALIERI His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle.
OLD SALIERI And suddenly in that silence, music.
OLD SALIERI A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri.
OLD SALIERI What sublimity!
OLD SALIERI What depth!
OLD SALIERI What passion in the music!
OLD SALIERI Salieri has been touched by God at last.
OLD SALIERI And God, forced to listen.
OLD SALIERI Powerless - powerless to stop it.
OLD SALIERI I at the end, for once, laughing at Him.
OLD SALIERI Do you understand?
OLD SALIERI Do you?
VOGLER Yes.
OLD SALIERI The only thing that worried me was the actual killing.
OLD SALIERI How does one do that?
OLD SALIERI How does one kill a man?
OLD SALIERI It's one thing to dream about it.
OLD SALIERI It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
He raises his own hands and stares at them.
The raging Dies Irae from Mozart's Requiem Mass bursts upon us.
Mozart sits working frantically at this demonic music.
His whole expression is one of wildness and engulfing fever.
He pours wine down his throat, spilling it, and grimaces as it hits his stomach.
All around him are manuscripts.
There is a banging at the front door.
Mozart does not hear it; the music raves on.
Another knocking comes, louder.
Constanze appears from the bedroom and stares at her distracted husband.
The knocking is repeated again, even more violently and insistently.
CONSTANZE Wolfi.
CONSTANZE Wolfi!
He looks at her.
The music breaks off.
Silence.
An enormous bang at the door startles him.
Constanze moves to open it.
MOZART No.
MOZART Don't answer it!
CONSTANZE Why?
Mozart springs up.
He is clearly terrified.
MOZART Tell him I'm not here.
MOZART Tell him I'm working on it.
MOZART Come back later.
He runs out of he room, into his workroom, and shuts he door.
Now a little scared herself, Constanze goes to he front door and opens it cautiously.
Schikaneder stands there, floridly dressed as usual.
Lorl is seen peeking out from the kitchen.
SCHIKANEDER Am I interrupting something?
CONSTANZE Not at all.
SCHIKANEDER Where's our friend?
CONSTANZE He's not in.
CONSTANZE But he's working on it.
CONSTANZE He said to tell you.
SCHIKANEDER I hope so.
SCHIKANEDER I need it immediately.
He pushes her into the room.
SCHIKANEDER Is he happy with it?
He sees he manuscript on the table, and goes to it eagerly.
SCHIKANEDER Is this it?
He picks up a page without waiting for a reply.
SCHIKANEDER What the devil is this?
SCHIKANEDER Requiem Mass?
SCHIKANEDER Does he think I'm in the funeral business?
Mozart opens he workroom door.
We see him as Schikaneder sees him: wild-eyed, extremely pale and strange.
MOZART Leave that alone!
SCHIKANEDER Wolfi!
MOZART Put it down!
SCHIKANEDER What is this?
MOZART Put it down, I said!
MOZART It's nothing for you.
SCHIKANEDER Oh!
SCHIKANEDER I'm sorry!
SCHIKANEDER I'm sorry!
SCHIKANEDER What have you got for me?
SCHIKANEDER Is it finished?
MOZART What?
SCHIKANEDER What?
SCHIKANEDER The vaudeville, what'd you think?
MOZART Yes.
SCHIKANEDER Can I see it?
MOZART No.
SCHIKANEDER Why not?
MOZART Because there's nothing to see.
He giggles triumphantly.
Schikaneder stares at him.
SCHIKANEDER Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
MOZART Well, we can.
SCHIKANEDER So let me see it.
SCHIKANEDER Where is it?
Mozart, with a bright, rather demented smile presents his head to Schikaneder.
MOZART Here.
MOZART It's all right here, in my noodle.
MOZART The rest is just scribbling.
MOZART Scribbling and bibbling.
MOZART Bibbling and scribbling.
MOZART Would you like a drink?
He giggles.
Schikaneder suddenly grabs his lapels.
SCHIKANEDER Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you?
SCHIKANEDER Do you know how many people are waiting?
CONSTANZE Leave him alone!
SCHIKANEDER I'm paying these people.
SCHIKANEDER Do you realize that?
CONSTANZE He's doing his best.
SCHIKANEDER I'm paying people just to wait for you.
SCHIKANEDER It's ridiculous!
CONSTANZE You know what's ridiculous?
CONSTANZE Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous.
CONSTANZE Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
SCHIKANEDER Oh yes?
SCHIKANEDER And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
CONSTANZE Money!
CONSTANZE Money!
SCHIKANEDER You're mad!
SCHIKANEDER She's mad, Wolfi.
CONSTANZE Oh yes, and who are you?
CONSTANZE He's worked for Kings.
CONSTANZE For the Emperor.
CONSTANZE Who are you?
Schikaneder suddenly takes Mozart by the arms, and speaks to him with intense appeal.
SCHIKANEDER Listen, Wolfi.
SCHIKANEDER Write it.
SCHIKANEDER Please.
SCHIKANEDER Just write it down.
SCHIKANEDER On paper.
SCHIKANEDER It's no good to anyone in your head.
SCHIKANEDER And fuck the Death Mass.
A frightened and tearful Lorl sits before Salieri.
SALIERI Now calm yourself.
SALIERI Calm.
SALIERI What's the matter with you?
LORL I'm leaving.
LORL I'm not working there anymore.
LORL I'm scared!
SALIERI Why?
SALIERI What has happened?
LORL You don't know what it's like.
LORL Herr Mozart frightens me.
LORL He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
SALIERI What medicine?
LORL I don't know.
LORL He has pains.
SALIERI Where?
LORL Here, in his stomach.
LORL They bend him right over.
SALIERI Is he working?
LORL I'm frightened, sir.
LORL Really!
LORL When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense.
LORL You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father.
LORL And his father's dead.
SALIERI Is he working?
LORL I suppose so.
LORL He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
SALIERI Opera?
SALIERI Opera!
LORL Please don't ask me to go back again.
LORL I'm frightened!
LORL I'm very, very frightened.
SALIERI Are you sure it's an opera?
The Overture to The Magic Flute begins grandly.
To the music of the slow introduction, we see:
The room, lit by a few candles, appears dirty.
The camera shows us again Leopold's portrait on the wall, looking down upon a scene of disorder.
Papers litter the table; dirty dishes are piled in the fireplace; on the forte-piano lies Mozart's Masonic apron, woven with symbols.
To the more lyrical passage of the introduction, we see Mozart take up a candle and enter:
We watch him stand beside Constanze, who lies asleep.
Mozart now looks very ill; his wife appears worn out.
Tenderly he touches her hair.
Then he moves to the cot where his son Karl lies asleep and kneels, pulls up the child's little blanket and for a moment lays his own head down beside the boy's.
Constanze opens her eyes and stares at him.
Mozart rises and returns to:
The Introduction ends and suddenly the brilliant fast fugue begins.
Instantly Mozart starts to dance to it, all alone: gleefully, like a child.
He looks up at his father's portrait, and makes a silly, rude gesture at it.
He is, briefly, an irresponsible and happy boy again.
Then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door.
The music fades down.
Warily, Mozart crosses and opens he door.
The familiar dark chords from Don Giovanni cut across the happy music.
It ends.
Before him stands the masked stranger.
MOZART I don't have it yet.
MOZART It's not finished.
MOZART I'm sorry, but I need more time.
SALIERI Are you neglecting my request?
MOZART No, no!
MOZART I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
He turns and looks.
Constanze has come into the living room.
Nervously, Mozart indicates her.
MOZART This is my wife, Stanzi.
MOZART I've been sick, but I'm all right now.
MOZART Aren't
CONSTANZE Oh yes, sir.
CONSTANZE He's all right.
CONSTANZE And he's working on it very hard.
MOZART Give me two more weeks.
MOZART Please.
Salieri contemplates them both.
SALIERI The sooner you finish, the better your reward.
SALIERI Work!
He turns and goes down the stairs.
Mozart shuts the door; he closes his eyes in fear.
CONSTANZE Wolfi, I think you really are going mad.
CONSTANZE You work like a slave for that idiot actor who won't give you a penny and here.
CONSTANZE This is not a ghost!
CONSTANZE This is a real man who puts down real money.
CONSTANZE Why on earth don't you finish it?
He will not look at her or reply.
CONSTANZE Give me one reason I can understand.
MOZART I can't write it!
CONSTANZE Why not?
MOZART It's killing me.
He looks at her suddenly.
CONSTANZE No, this is really awful.
CONSTANZE You're drunk, aren't you?
CONSTANZE Be honest - tell me - you've been drinking.
CONSTANZE And I'm so stupid I stay here and listen to you!
Suddenly she starts to cry.
CONSTANZE It's not fair!
CONSTANZE I worry about you all the time.
CONSTANZE I try to help you all I can and you just drink and talk nonsense and - and frighten me!
CONSTANZE It's not fair!
Her tears flow.
Mozart looks at her helplessly.
MOZART Go back to bed.
CONSTANZE Please!
CONSTANZE Let me sit here.
CONSTANZE Let me stay here with you.
CONSTANZE I promise I won't say all word.
CONSTANZE I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you.
CONSTANZE Please, please!
She sits down tearfully, staring at him.
We hear the Rex Tremendai Majestatis from the Requiem and see on the wall the portrait of Leopold Mozart looking down.
The camera pans slowly downward from it back to the table.
Mozart is writing the music.
He looks up and sees that Constanze is fast asleep in her chair.
Mozart gets up quietly.
He puts on his hat and cloak, takes a bottle of wine and tiptoes from the house.
Without stopping, the music changes from the heavy Requiem to the light-hearted patter of the Papa-Papa duet from The Magic Flute.
This little wooden structure stands in a courtyard in the tenement by the Weiden.
Inside, we see a table, chairs, a forte-piano, bottles and a chaos of papers.
Strewn about in the chairs are the three actresses, giggling.
Schikaneder and Mozart, both drunk, are singing the duet of the two bird- people.
The actor sings Papageno and the composer, in a soprano voice, sings Papagena at the keyboard.
Absurdly, they end up rubbing noses and fall on each other's necks.
Mozart, drunk and happy, staggers back through the snow.
There are a few people about.
He goes into his apartment building.
He comes through he door and stares across the living room at an open bedroom door.
Puzzled, he crosses.
The bedroom is also empty.
We see Constanze's empty bed; Karl's empty bed; empty closets.
MOZART Stanzi?
MOZART Stanzi-marini-bini?
He looks about him, puzzled.
Frau Weber sits grimly talking.
Mozart sits also, completely exhausted and passive under the rain of her constant speech.
FRAU WEBER She's not coming back, you know.
FRAU WEBER She's gone for good.
FRAU WEBER I did it and I'm proud of it.
FRAU WEBER 'Leave,' I said.
FRAU WEBER 'Right away!
FRAU WEBER Take he child and go, just go.
FRAU WEBER Here's the money!
FRAU WEBER Go to the Spa and get your health back - that's if you can.' I was shocked.
FRAU WEBER Shocked to my foundation.
FRAU WEBER Is that my girl?
FRAU WEBER Can that be my Stanzi?
FRAU WEBER The happy little moppet I brought up, that poor trembling thing?
FRAU WEBER Oh, you monster!
FRAU WEBER No one exists but you, do they?
FRAU WEBER You and your music!
FRAU WEBER Do you know how often she's sat in that very chair, weeping her eyes out of her head because of you?
FRAU WEBER I warned her.
FRAU WEBER 'Choose a man, not a baby,' I said.
FRAU WEBER But would she listen?
FRAU WEBER Who listens?
FRAU WEBER 'He's just a silly boy,' she says.
FRAU WEBER Silly, my arse.
FRAU WEBER Selfish - that's all you are.
FRAU WEBER Selfish!
FRAU WEBER Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish.
And with a scream Madame Weber's voice turns into the shrill packing coloratura of the second act aria of the Queen of the Night, in The Magic Flute.
On stage we see the QUEEN OF THE NIGHT fantastically costumed, furiously urging her daughter to kill Sarastro.
As she sings, we see the interior of the theatre, now re-arranged from when we last visited it to watch the Cabaret.
An audience of ordinary German citizens stands in the pit area, or sits: they are rapt and excited.
The theatre also possesses boxes; some of these show closed curtains - their inhabitants presumably engaged in private intimacies.
In one of them sits Salieri.
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT A hellish wrath within my heart is seething!
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT Death and destruction Flame around my throne!
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT If not by thee Sarastro's light be extinguished.
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT Then be thou mine own daughter never more!
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT Rejected be forever!
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT So sundered be forever All the bonds of kin and blood!
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT Hear!
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT Hear!
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT Hear God of Vengeance!
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT Hear thy Mother's vow!
Thunder and lightning.
She disappears amidst tremendous applause from the audience.
On the poster for The Magic Flute, the name Emmanuel Schikaneder should appear very, very large and the name of Mozart quite small:
I.
& R. priv.
Weiden Theatre The Actors of the Imperial and Royal Privileged Theatre of the Weiden Have the honour to perform
THE MAGIC FLUTE A Grand Opera in Two Acts By Emmanuel Schikaneder
The music is by Herr Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Herr Mozart out of respect for a gracious and honourable Public, and from friendship for the author of this piece, will today direct the orchestra in person.
The book of the opera, furnished with two copperplates, of which is engraved Herr Schikaneder in the costume he wears for the role of Papageno, may be had at the box office for 30 kr.
Prices of admission are as usual To begin at 7 o'clock
We CUT TO the scene immediately before Papageno's song, Ein Madchen oder Weibchen.
Papageno, played by Schikaneder, dressed in his costume of feathers, is trying to get through a mysterious door.
A voice calls from within.
VOICE Go back!
Papageno recoils.
PAPAGENO Merciful Gods!
PAPAGENO If only I knew by which door I came in.
PAPAGENO Which was it?
PAPAGENO Was it this one?
PAPAGENO Come on, tell me!
VOICE Go back!
Papageno recoils.
PAPAGENO Now, I can't go forward and I can't go back.
PAPAGENO Oh, this is awful!
He weeps extravagantly.
In the pit, Mozart indicates to the first violinist to take over as conductor.
He slips from his place and goes stealthily backstage.
We follow him.
Over the scene we hear Papageno being addressed by the First Priest in stern tones.
FIRST PRIEST Man, thou hast deserved to wander forever in the darkest chasms of the earth.
FIRST PRIEST The gentle Gods have remitted thy punishment, but yet thou shalt never feel the Divine Content of the consecrated ones.
PAPAGENO Oh well, I'm not alone in that.
PAPAGENO Just give me a decent glass of wine - that's divine content enough for me.
Laughter.
An enormous goblet of wine appears out of the earth.
We follow Mozart into the wings.
Actors and actresses stand around in fantastic costumes.
We see a flying chariot and parts of a huge snake lying about.
Also the scenery door of a temple with the word 'Wisdom' inscribed on the pediment.
Mozart walks to where there stands a keyboard glockenspiel with several manuals, and a musician waiting to play it.
Silently Mozart indicates that he wishes to play the instrument himself.
On stage Schikaneder is being addressed haughtily by the First Priest.
FIRST PRIEST Man, hast thou no other desire on earth, but just to eat and drink?
PAPAGENO Well!
Laughter from the audience.
PAPAGENO Well, actually I do have a rather weird feeling in my heart.
PAPAGENO Perhaps it's just indigestion.
PAPAGENO But you know, I really would like - I really do want - something even nicer than food and drink.
PAPAGENO Now what on earth could that be?
He stares at the audience and winks at them.
They laugh.
Now Papageno's aria (Ein Madchen oder Weibchen) begins.
It is interpolated, as he pretends to play his magic bells, with the glockenspiel actually being played off-stage by Mozart.
Schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see Mozart conducting.
He looks into the wings and realizes the situation with amusement.
He sings joyfully and the audience watches entranced.
ANDANTE A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish.
ANDANTE A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
ANDANTE Be my most tasty little dish!
ANDANTE Be my most tasty little dish!
ALLEGRO Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking.
ALLEGRO The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine!
ALLEGRO Then that would be eating and drinking!
ALLEGRO The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine.
ALLEGRO She's much better than wine!
ALLEGRO She's much better than wine!
ANDANTE A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish.
ANDANTE A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
ALLEGRO I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely.
ALLEGRO But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.
ALLEGRO I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.
ALLEGRO To a ghost I must fade!
ALLEGRO To a ghost I must fade!
ANDANTE A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish.
ANDANTE A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
ALLEGRO At present the girls only peck me.
ALLEGRO Their cruelty surely will wreck me.
ALLEGRO But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown!
ALLEGRO At present the girls only peck me.
ALLEGRO But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown.
ALLEGRO Up to heaven be flown!
ALLEGRO Up to heaven be flown!
At certain moments we see the stage from Salieri's point of view: Schikaneder singing, then pretending to play; and then we see Mozart playing the glockenspiel with great flourishes in the wings.
Then, suddenly, the actor mimes playing, and no sound comes.
He mimes again, but still nothing comes.
He looks offstage in anxiety; there is evidently some commotion.
People are looking down on the floor.
The song comes to a near-halt.
Schikaneder stares.
Then the comedian signals to the deputy conductor to pick up the song and finish it.
At this moment Salieri gets up and hastily leaves his box.
We see the actress playing Papagena, wearing an old tattered cloak and about to tie a little painted cloth representing a hideous old woman over her face.
She is looking worriedly down at Mozart, who is lying unconscious on the floor.
A few people around him are trying to revive him.
One has put a wet handkerchief around his temples.
Another is holding a small bottle of smelling salts.
There are voices saying, 'Doctor!
Take him to a dressing room.
Someone call a carriage.
Take him home.' Etc.
Papagena is urged to go on stage by a distracted stage manager.
Suddenly we hear the voice of Salieri.
SALIERI I'll take care of him.
He steps forward.
SALIERI I have a carriage.
SALIERI Excuse me.
The actors step back respectfully.
He stoops and picks up the frail composer in his arms.
Mozart is quite limp and Salieri has to fling his arms around his own neck.
All this is watched nervously by Schikaneder on stage whilst performing his scene with Papagena as an ugly old woman.
UGLY OLD WOMAN Here I am, my angel.
PAPAGENO What?
PAPAGENO Who the devil are you?
UGLY OLD WOMAN I've taken pity on you, my angel.
UGLY OLD WOMAN I heard your wish.
PAPAGENO Oh.
PAPAGENO Well, thank you!
PAPAGENO How wonderful.
PAPAGENO Some people get all the luck.
Audience laughter.
The actress raises the little painted cloth with the ugly old face on it to show her own pretty young one to the audience.
More laughter.
UGLY OLD WOMAN Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever.
UGLY OLD WOMAN Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
PAPAGENO I can't wait.
UGLY OLD WOMAN Well, promise then.
PAPAGENO What do you mean - now?
UGLY OLD WOMAN Of course now.
UGLY OLD WOMAN Right away, before I get any older.
Laughter.
PAPAGENO Well, I don't know!
PAPAGENO I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
UGLY OLD WOMAN Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy.
UGLY OLD WOMAN I'm tender enough for you.
Laughter.
A waiting sedan chair.
Mozart has recovered consciousness, but looks exceedingly ill.
Salieri has set him down in the winter's night.
Snow is falling.
MOZART What happened?
MOZART Is it over?
SALIERI I'm taking you home.
SALIERI You're not well.
MOZART No, no.
MOZART I have to get back.
MOZART I have -
He starts to collapse again.
Salieri helps him into the sedan.
The door is shut.
The chair sets off and Salieri strides beside it, through the mean street.
A lantern with a candle swings from the chair.
The door opens.
Salieri enters carrying the lantern from the sedan chair.
He is followed by Mozart, carried in the arms of one of the porters.
The room is now really in complete disarray.
The table is piled high with music: the pages of the Requiem lie amongst many empty wine bottles.
The porter carries Mozart into
This room is miserably neglected.
The bed is unmade, clothes lie about on the floor.
A sock has been stuck into the broken pane of one window.
The porter lays Mozart down on the bed as Salieri lights candles from the lantern to reveal plates of half-eaten food and other signs left by a man whose wife has departed.
It is obviously very cold.
Another very small bed nearby belongs to the child, Karl.
SALIERI Thank you.
SALIERI Go.
The porter leaves the room.
Mozart stirs.
MOZART Papa!
MOZART Papa!
He opens his eyes and sees Salieri staring down at him.
He smiles.
SALIERI Come now.
He helps him to sit up and takes off his coat and his shoes and puts a coverlet around him.
SALIERI Where is your wife?
MOZART Not here!
MOZART She's not well, either.
MOZART She went to the Spa.
SALIERI You mean she's not coming back?
MOZART You're so good to me.
MOZART Truly.
MOZART Thank you.
SALIERI No, please.
MOZART I mean to come to my opera.
MOZART You are the only colleague who did.
He struggles to loosen his cravat.
Salieri does it for him.
SALIERI I would never miss anything that you had written.
SALIERI You must know that.
MOZART This is only a vaudeville.
SALIERI Oh no.
SALIERI It is a sublime piece.
SALIERI The grandest operone.
SALIERI I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
MOZART Do you mean that?
SALIERI I do.
MOZART I have bad fancies.
MOZART I don't sleep well anymore.
MOZART Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
SALIERI Are you ill?
MOZART The doctor thinks I am.
MOZART But -
SALIERI What?
MOZART I'm too young to be so sick.
There is a violent knocking at the front door.
Mozart starts and looks around wildly.
SALIERI Shall I answer it?
MOZART No!
MOZART No, it's him!
SALIERI Who?
MOZART The man.
MOZART He's here.
SALIERI What man?
The knocking increases in loudness, terrifying Mozart.
MOZART Tell him to go away.
MOZART Tell him I'm still working on it.
MOZART Don't let him in!
Salieri moves to the door.
MOZART Wait!
MOZART Ask him if he'd give me some money now.
MOZART Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
SALIERI Finish what?
MOZART He knows.
MOZART He knows!
Salieri leaves the room.
Salieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal Schikaneder, who has obviously come straight from the theatre.
He still wears his bird make-up and under his street cloak, his feathered costume is clearly seen.
He has with him the three actresses, also looking anxious and also in make-up as the three attendants in The Magic Flute.
SCHIKANEDER Herr Salieri.
SALIERI Yes, I am looking after him.
SCHIKANEDER Can we come in?
SALIERI Well, he's sleeping now.
SALIERI Better not.
SCHIKANEDER But he's all right?
SALIERI Oh, yes.
SALIERI He's just exhausted.
SALIERI He became dizzy, that's all.
SALIERI We should let him rest.
SCHIKANEDER Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
SALIERI Of course.
SCHIKANEDER And say everything went wonderfully.
SCHIKANEDER A triumph-de-luxe - say that!
SCHIKANEDER Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
SALIERI Bene.
SCHIKANEDER I'll call tomorrow.
SALIERI Yes.
SALIERI And congratulations to all of you.
SALIERI It was superb.
ACTRESSES Thank you!
ACTRESSES Thank you, Excellency!
Schikaneder produces a bag of money.
SCHIKANEDER Oh, by the way, give him this.
SCHIKANEDER This is his share.
SCHIKANEDER That should cheer him up, eh?
SALIERI Yes, indeed.
SALIERI Goodnight to you all now.
SALIERI It was perfection - truly!
ACTRESSES Goodnight, Your Excellency.
ACTRESSES Goodnight!
They bob and curtsey.
Schikaneder stares at Salieri, uneasily, vaguely suspicious.
Salieri smiles back at him and shuts the door.
He stays for a moment, thinking.
He contemplates the money.
Mozart is sitting up in bed, staring at the door.
It opens.
Salieri returns.
He holds in his hand the bag of money.
MOZART What happened?
Salieri pours the coins out of the bag onto the coverlet.
SALIERI He said to give you this.
SALIERI And if you finish the work by tomorrow night, he will pay you another hundred ducats.
Mozart looks at the coins astonished.
MOZART Another?
MOZART But that's too soon!
MOZART Tomorrow night?
MOZART It's impossible!
MOZART Did he say a hundred?
SALIERI Yes.
SALIERI Can I - could I help you, in any way?
MOZART Would you?
MOZART Actually, you could.
SALIERI My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
MOZART But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul.
MOZART I'm not allowed.
SALIERI Of course.
MOZART You know, it's all here in my head.
MOZART It's just ready to be set down.
MOZART But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus.
MOZART I can't write.
SALIERI Then, let us try together.
SALIERI I'd regard it as such an honour.
SALIERI Tell me, what is this work?
MOZART A Mass.
MOZART A Mass for the Dead.
Trivial dance music is playing.
Constanze is doing a waltz with a young OFFICER in military uniform.
At the moment we see her, she stops abruptly, as if in panic.
OFFICER What is it?
CONSTANZE I want to go!
OFFICER Where?
CONSTANZE I want to go back to Vienna.
OFFICER Now?
CONSTANZE Yes!
OFFICER Why?
CONSTANZE I feel wrong.
CONSTANZE I feel wrong being here.
OFFICER What are you talking about?
Mozart is sitting up in bed, propped against pillows.
The coins lie on the coverlet; many candles burn in the necks of bottles.
Salieri, without coat or wig, is seated at an improvised worktable.
On it are blank sheets of music paper, quills, and ink.
Also the score of the Requiem Mass as so far composed.
Mozart is bright-eyed with a kind of fever.
Salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire to put down the notes as quickly as Mozart can dictate them.
MOZART Where did I stop?
SALIERI The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
MOZART So now the Confutatis.
MOZART Confutatis Maledictis.
MOZART When the wicked are confounded.
MOZART Flammis acribus addictis.
MOZART How would you translate that?
SALIERI Consigned to flames of woe.
MOZART Do you believe in it?
SALIERI What?
MOZART A fire which never dies.
MOZART Burning one forever?
SALIERI Oh, yes.
MOZART Strange!
SALIERI Come.
SALIERI Let's begin.
He takes his pen.
SALIERI Confutatis Maledictis.
MOZART We ended in F Major?
SALIERI Yes.
MOZART So now - A minor.
MOZART Suddenly.
Salieri writes the key signature.
MOZART The Fire.
SALIERI What time?
MOZART Common time.
Salieri writes this, and continues now to write as swiftly and urgently as he can, at Mozart's dictation.
He is obviously highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates.
His speed, however, can never be too fast for Mozart's impatient mind.
MOZART Start with the voices.
MOZART Basses first.
MOZART Second beat of the first measure -
A. Con-fu-ta-tis.
A. Second measure, second beat.
A. Ma-le-dic-tis.
A. G-sharp, of course.
SALIERI Yes.
MOZART Third measure, second beat starting on E.
MOZART Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
MOZART And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.
MOZART Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.
MOZART Do you have that?
SALIERI I think so.
MOZART Sing it back.
Salieri sings back the first six measures of the bass line.
After the first two measures a chorus of basses fades in on the soundtrack and engulfs his voice.
They stop.
MOZART Good.
MOZART Now the tenors.
MOZART Fourth beat of the first measure - C.
MOZART Con-fu-ta-tis.
MOZART Second measure, fourth beat on D.
MOZART Ma-le-dic-tis.
MOZART All right?
SALIERI Yes.
MOZART Fourth measure, second beat - F.
MOZART Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
His voice is lost on the last words, as tenors engulf it and take over the soundtrack, singing their whole line from the beginning, right to the end of the sixth measure where the basses stopped, but he goes on mouthing the sounds with them.
Salieri writes feverishly.
We see his pen jotting down the notes as quickly as possible: the ink flicks onto the page.
The music stops again.
MOZART Now the orchestra.
MOZART Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses.
MOZART Identical notes and rhythm.
MOZART The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
SALIERI Please!
SALIERI Just one moment.
Mozart glares at him, irritated.
His hands move impatiently.
Salieri scribbles frantically.
MOZART It couldn't be simpler.
SALIERI First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
MOZART With the tenors.
SALIERI Also identical?
MOZART Exactly.
MOZART The instruments to go with the voices.
MOZART Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
He again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning, conducting.
On the soundtrack, we hear the second bassoon and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and tenor trombone come in on top, playing the tenor vocal line.
We also hear the trumpets and timpani.
The sound is bare and grim.
It stops at the end of the sixth measure.
Salieri stops writing.
SALIERI And that's all?
MOZART Oh no.
MOZART Now for the Fire.
MOZART Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
He sings the urgent first measure of the ostinato.
MOZART Second measure on B.
He sings the second measure of the ostinato.
MOZART Do you have me?
SALIERI I think so.
MOZART Show me.
Salieri sings the first two measures of the string ostinato.
MOZART Good, good - yes!
MOZART Put it down.
MOZART And the next measures exactly the same, rising and rising - C to D to E, up to the dominant chord.
MOZART Do you see?
As Salieri writes, Mozart sings the ostinato from the beginning, but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice on the soundtrack, playing the first six bars of their agitated accompaniment.
They stop.
SALIERI That's wonderful!
MOZART Yes, yes - go on.
MOZART The Voca Me.
Suddenly sotto voce.
Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo.
Voca me cum benedictis.
Call me among the blessed.
He is now sitting bolt upright, hushed and inspired.
MOZART C Major.
MOZART Sopranos and altos in thirds.
MOZART Altos on C. Sopranos above.
MOZART Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
SALIERI Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
MOZART Yes, and on 'dictis'.
SALIERI Yes!
He writes feverishly.
MOZART And underneath, just violins - arpeggio.
He sings the violin figure under the Voca Me (Bars 7,8,9).
MOZART The descending scale in eighth notes, and then back suddenly to the fire again.
He sings the ostinato phrase twice.
MOZART And that's it.
MOZART Do you have it?
SALIERI You go fast!
MOZART Do you have it?
SALIERI Yes.
MOZART Then let me hear it.
MOZART All of it.
MOZART The whole thing from the beginning - now!
The entire Confutatis bursts over the room, as Mozart snatches the manuscript pages from Salieri and reads from it, singing.
Salieri sits looking on in wondering astonishment.
The music continues right through the following scenes, to the end of the movement.
A carriage is driving fast through the night.
Snow lies on the countryside.
The carriage is filled with passengers.
Among them Constanze and Karl, her young son.
They are sleepless and sway to the motion of the vehicle.
Mozart lying in bed exhausted, but still dictating urgently.
We do not hear what he is saying to Salieri, who still sits writing assiduously.
Mozart is looking very sick: sweat is pouring from his forehead.
The carriage, moving through the night, to the sound of the music.
Mozart still dictating; Salieri still writing without stop.
The carriage has arrived.
Constanze and her son alight with other passengers.
Postillions attend to the horses.
She takes her boy's hand.
It is a cold wintry dawn.
The music stutters to a close.
End of the Confutatis.
MOZART Do you want to rest a bit?
SALIERI Oh no.
SALIERI I'm not tired at all.
MOZART We'll stop for just a moment.
MOZART Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
SALIERI I can keep going, I assure you.
SALIERI Shall we try?
MOZART Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
SALIERI I'm not leaving you.
MOZART I am so ashamed.
SALIERI What for?
MOZART I was foolish.
MOZART I thought you did not care for my work - or me.
MOZART Forgive me.
MOZART Forgive me!
Mozart closes his eyes.
Salieri stares at him.
Constanze and Karl approach along the cobbled street, hand in hand toward their house.
Snow lies in the street.
Mozart lies asleep in the bed, holding the last pages of the manuscript.
Salieri lies across from him on Karl's small bed in his shirt sleeves and waistcoat.
The child's bed is obviously too small for him and he is forced in to a cramped position.
Constanze and Karl arrive at the door.
They enter.
It is as disordered as before, save that the table, previously littered with pages, is now completely bare.
Constanze looks at it with surprise and enters the bedroom.
Mozart is asleep in the bed.
Salieri is dozing on the nearby child's bed.
The room is full of the trailing smoke from guttering and guttered candles.
Startled by Constanze's entrance and her young son, Salieri scrambles up.
As he does so, he attempts to button his waistcoat, but does it ineptly, so that the vestment becomes bunched up, making him look absurd.
CONSTANZE What are you doing here?
SALIERI Your husband is ill, ma'am.
SALIERI He took sick.
SALIERI I brought him home.
CONSTANZE Why you?
SALIERI I was at hand.
CONSTANZE Well, thank you very much.
CONSTANZE You can go now.
SALIERI He needs me, ma'am.
CONSTANZE No, he doesn't.
CONSTANZE And I don't want you here.
CONSTANZE Just go, please.
SALIERI He asked me to stay.
CONSTANZE And I'm asking you -
She notices a movement from the bed.
Mozart wakes.
He sees Constanze and smiles with real joy.
Forgetting Salieri, she goes to her husband.
CONSTANZE Wolfi, I'm back.
CONSTANZE I'm still very angry with you, but I missed you so much.
She throws herself on the bed.
CONSTANZE I'll never leave you again.
CONSTANZE If you'll just try a little harder to be nice to me.
CONSTANZE And I'll try to do better, too.
CONSTANZE We must.
CONSTANZE We must!
CONSTANZE This was just silly and stupid.
She hugs her husband desperately.
He stares at her with obvious relief, not able to speak.
Suddenly she sees the manuscript in his hand.
CONSTANZE What is this?
She looks at it and recognizes it.
CONSTANZE Oh no, not this.
CONSTANZE Not this, Wolfi!
CONSTANZE You're not to work on this ever again!
CONSTANZE I've decided.
She takes it from his weak hand.
At the same moment Salieri reaches out his hand to take it and add it to the pile on the table.
She stares at him, trying to understand - suspicious and frightened and at the same time unable to make a sound.
Mozart makes a convulsive gesture to reclaim the pages.
The coins brought by Salieri fall on the floor.
Karl runs after them, laughing.
CONSTANZE This is not his handwriting.
SALIERI No.
SALIERI I was assisting him.
SALIERI He asked me.
CONSTANZE He's not going to work on this anymore.
CONSTANZE It is making him ill.
CONSTANZE Please.
She extends her hand for the Requiem, as she stands up.
Salieri hesitates.
CONSTANZE Please.
With extreme reluctance - it costs him agony to do it - Salieri hands over the score of the Requiem to her.
CONSTANZE Thank you.
She marches with the manuscript over to a large chest in the room, opens it, throws the manuscript inside, shuts the lid, locks it and pockets the key.
Involuntarily Salieri stretches out his arms for the lost manuscript.
SALIERI But - but - but -
She turns and faces him.
CONSTANZE Good night.
He stares at her, stunned.
CONSTANZE I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri.
CONSTANZE Respect my wish and go.
SALIERI Madame, I will respect his.
SALIERI He asked me to stay here.
They look at each other in mutual hatred.
She turns to the bed.
Mozart appears to have gone to sleep again.
CONSTANZE Wolfi?
CONSTANZE Wolfi?
She moves to the bed.
The child is playing with the coins on the floor.
Faintly we hear the start of the Lacrimosa from the Requiem.
Salieri watches as she touches her husband's hand.
As the music grows, we realize that Mozart is dead.
CU, Constanze staring wide-eyed in dawning apprehension.
CU, Salieri also comprehending hat he has been cheated.
The music rises.
CU, The child on the floor, playing with the money.
The Lacrimosa continues through all of the following: a small group of people emerges from the side door into the raw, wet day, accompanying a cheap wooden coffin.
The coffin is borne by a gravedigger and Schikaneder in mourning clothes.
They load it onto a cart, drawn by a poor black horse.
All the rest are in black, also: Salieri, Von Swieten, Constanze and her son, Karl, Madame Weber and her youngest daughter Sophie, and even Lorl, the maid.
It is drizzling.
The cart sets off.
The group follows.
The group has already passed beyond the city limits following the miserable cart.
The Lacrimosa accompanies them with its measured thread.
The drizzle of rain has now become heavy.
One by one, the group breaks up and shelters under the trees.
The cart moves on toward the cemetery, alone, followed by nobody, growing more and more distant.
They watch it go.
Salieri and Von Swieten shake hands mournfully, the water soaking their black tall hats.
Schikaneder is in tears.
Constanze is near collapse.
Salieri moves to assist her, but she turns away from him, seeking the arm of Cavalieri.
Madame Weber takes Karl's hand.
The music builds to its climax on Dona Eis Pacem!
We CUT back to:
Morning light fills the room.
Old Salieri sits weeping convulsively, as the music stops.
Tears stream down his face.
Vogler watches him, amazed.
VOGLER Why?
VOGLER Why?
VOGLER Why?
VOGLER Why add to your misery by confessing to murder?
VOGLER You didn't kill him.
OLD SALIERI I did.
VOGLER No, you didn't!
OLD SALIERI I poisoned his life.
VOGLER But not his body.
OLD SALIERI What difference does that make?
VOGLER My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer?
VOGLER Is that your penance?
VOGLER Is it?
OLD SALIERI No, Father.
OLD SALIERI From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me.
OLD SALIERI Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing.
OLD SALIERI And that's my immortality - at last!
OLD SALIERI Our names will be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy.
OLD SALIERI At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
VOGLER Oh my son, my poor son!
OLD SALIERI Don't pity me.
OLD SALIERI Pity yourself.
OLD SALIERI You serve a wicked God.
OLD SALIERI He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity.
OLD SALIERI He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory.
OLD SALIERI He doesn't care.
OLD SALIERI Understand that.
OLD SALIERI God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses.
OLD SALIERI He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away.
OLD SALIERI Like an old, worn out flute.
The rain has eased off.
A LOCAL PRIEST with two boy acolytes is standing beside an open communal grave.
Mozart's body is lifted out of the cheap pine box in a sack.
We see that the grave contains twenty other such sacks.
The gravedigger throws the one containing Mozart amongst the others.
An assistant pours quicklime over the whole pile of them.
The acolytes swing their censers.
LOCAL PRIEST The Lord giveth.
LOCAL PRIEST The Lord taketh away.
LOCAL PRIEST Blessed be the name of the Lord.
OLD SALIERI Why did He do it?
OLD SALIERI Why didn't He kill me?
OLD SALIERI I had no value.
OLD SALIERI What was the use, keeping me alive for thirty-two years of torture?
OLD SALIERI Thirty-two years of honours and awards.
He tears off the Civilian Medal and Chain with which the Emperor invested him and has been wearing the whole time and throws it across the room.
OLD SALIERI Being bowed to and saluted, called 'distinguished - distinguished Salieri' - by men incapable of distinguishing!
OLD SALIERI Thirty-two years of meaningless fame to end up alone in my room, watching myself become extinct.
OLD SALIERI My music growing fainter, all the time fainter, until no one plays it at all.
OLD SALIERI And his growing louder, filling the world with wonder.
OLD SALIERI And everyone who loves my sacred art crying, Mozart!
OLD SALIERI Bless you, Mozart.
The door opens.
An attendant comes in, cheerful and hearty.
ATTENDANT Good morning, Professor!
ATTENDANT Time for the water closet.
ATTENDANT And then we've got your favourite breakfast for you - sugar-rolls.
ATTENDANT He loves those.
ATTENDANT Fresh sugar-rolls.
Salieri ignores him and stares only at the priest, who stares back.
OLD SALIERI Goodbye, Father.
OLD SALIERI I'll speak for you.
OLD SALIERI I speak for all mediocrities in the world.
OLD SALIERI I am their champion.
OLD SALIERI I am their patron saint.
OLD SALIERI On their behalf I deny Him, your God of no mercy.
OLD SALIERI Your God who tortures men with longings they can never fulfill.
OLD SALIERI He may forgive me: I shall never forgive Him.
He signs to the attendant, who wheels him in his chair out of the room.
The priest stares after him.
The corridor is filled with patients in white linen smocks, all taking their morning exercise walk in the care of nurses and nuns.
They form a long, wretched, strange procession - some of them are clearly very disturbed.
As Old Salieri is pushed through them in his wheelchair, he lifts his hands to them in benediction.
OLD SALIERI Mediocrities everywhere, now and to come: I absolve you all!
OLD SALIERI Amen!
OLD SALIERI Amen!
OLD SALIERI Amen!
Finally, he turns full-face to the camera and blesses us the audience, making the Sign of the Cross.
Underneath we hear, stealing in and growing louder, the tremendous Masonic Funeral Music of Mozart.
On the last four chords, we
