THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO
Written by
Steven Zaillian
A Christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a scar pointing north to icy desolation.
A phone rings -
An elderly man who lives alone in this rustic cabin - a retired policeman - regards the phone, both expecting and dreading the call.
He picks up the receiver.
MORELL What kind is it?
VANGER O/S I don't know.
VANGER O/S White.
MORELL And the frame?
VANGER O/S Dark.
MORELL Postmark?
VANGER O/S Same as last time.
MORELL No note.
VANGER O/S No.
Henrik Vanger - at 82, even older than Morell - listens to the silence from his end of the line in a wood-paneled room as baronial as the policeman's was spartan.
VANGER I can't take it anymore.
MORELL O/S I know.
MORELL O/S I'm sorry, Henrik.
There's nothing more to say.
Vanger sets the receiver down and regards a dried white flower in a 6" x 11" frame resting on the brown paper it was wrapped and mailed in.
It's somehow ominous, like the dark storm clouds that now burst outside -
Mikael Blomkvist - 40's - regards the gauntlet of reporters he'll have to pass to get out of the building.
As he strides toward them, microphones and cameras swing in his direction.
Without stopping -
BLOMKVIST What is this, the media event of the year?
REPORTER 1 Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it won't work.
BLOMKVIST Don't try to play it up, that won't either.
Feeling a bit like he's fleeing the scene of a crime, which in a way he is, Blomkvist steps outside opening his umbrella.
A couple of the reporters come out after him -
REPORTER 2 Will you appeal?
BLOMKVIST I'll appeal to you, Viggo: Find a real story to cover.
He hurries off in the rain.
NEWSCASTER V/O Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel against financier Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
At a table with a pre-made sandwich and cup of coffee, and a long court judgement, Blomkvist watches himself fleeing the reporters on the cafe's TV.
He's the only one there who watches it - no one else is interested - which only makes it worse.
TV NEWSCASTER In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed Wennerstrom - founder and president of The Wennerstrom Group - used State funds intended for industrial development in Poland for an arms deal with the right-wing Ustashe in Croatia.
The report cuts to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the courthouse in an Armani suit, surrounded by his legal team, confidently addressing the reporters -
WENNERSTROM ON TV I have nothing against Mr.
WENNERSTROM ON TV Blomkvist.
WENNERSTROM ON TV He's a good journalist who I don't believe is guided by malice.
WENNERSTROM ON TV But what he wrote was inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go unanswered.
WENNERSTROM ON TV He - all journalists - have to accept like the rest of us, actions have consequences.
Done with his sandwich, Blomkvist goes to the counter.
BLOMKVIST Marlboro Red ...
BLOMKVIST and a lighter.
He comes out tamping the pack.
Extracts a cigarette.
Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin.
Flicks at the lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain.
Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life.
TV NEWSCASTER V/O Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600 thousand SKE in damages and all court costs, which could be significantly more.
He takes a long drag that dizzies him.
A wonderful feeling.
He regards the trash bin.
Fishes around it, finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket.
He comes through past Christmas decorations and a mostly- young staff.
They try not to regard him as a dead-man- walking, but aren't entirely successful.
He enters the editor's office.
ERIKA Where you been?
Erika Berger is about Blomkvist's age, and - like the IKEA furniture - sends a mixed message: a feminist in a mini-skirt.
BLOMKVIST Walking.
BLOMKVIST Thinking.
ERIKA Smoking?
BLOMKVIST Just one.
He sits, exhausted and depressed, in a cheap Poang chair.
ERIKA TV4 called.
ERIKA I told them no statement until we've read the judgment in its entirety.
BLOMKVIST I have.
BLOMKVIST Who else?
ERIKA Everyone who's ever wanted to see you humiliated.
BLOMKVIST You've been on the phone all day then.
ERIKA I'm as much to blame for this as you.
BLOMKVIST You are?
BLOMKVIST You wrote it?
ERIKA I read it.
ERIKA I ran it.
BLOMKVIST Not the same.
ERIKA Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael.
BLOMKVIST Mine is.
They regard each other in another silence.
Then -
BLOMKVIST I'm tired.
BLOMKVIST I feel like climbing under a duvet and sleeping for a week.
ERIKA Alone?
He thinks about it ...
shakes his head `no.'
ERIKA I already called Greger and told him I wouldn't be home tonight.
A motorcycle dives down a driveway that burrows under a three-story building.
Dragan Armansky, 40's, who looks more like a boss of a New Jersey crime family than CEO of a high-tech security firm, sits behind his desk, waiting with an older client.
ARMANSKY It's possible we could wait forever.
FRODE You called her, I thought.
FRODE You spoke to her.
ARMANSKY I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.
FRODE I don't understand.
ARMANSKY No one here likes her.
ARMANSKY So it's better if she works at home.
FRODE But you told her I wanted to meet her.
ARMANSKY But I've told her many more times I prefer her not to meet clients.
The figure from the motorcycle crosses the lobby.
From behind we can't see him/her well, but can see wary looks from others emerging from and getting into the elevator.
FRODE V/O But you like her.
ARMANSKY V/O Very much.
ARMANSKY V/O She's one of the best investigators I have.
ARMANSKY V/O As you saw from her report -
The report on Armansky's desk is 200 pages long.
INSERT: Printed on its cover: Mikael Blomkvist, a case number and, smaller, its author, Lisbeth Salander.
FRODE But.
ARMANSKY I'm concerned you won't like her.
ARMANSKY She's different.
FRODE In what way.
ARMANSKY In every way.
The black-clad figure - from behind again - strides past coworkers who look away.
SECRETARY/INTERCOM Ms. Salander's here.
Armansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom button twice to say `okay, let her in.'
Lisbeth Salander walks in: A small, pale, anorexic- looking waif in her early 20's.
Short black-dyed hair - pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably several more under her black leather jacket - black t- shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots.
Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his initial reaction to her.
This isn't punk fashion.
This is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me.
ARMANSKY Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode.
FRODE How do you do?
She doesn't shake Frode's hand, but does address him:
SALANDER Something wrong with the report?
FRODE No.
FRODE It seems quite thorough.
FRODE There's a wealth of data here.
FRODE But I'm also interested to know what's not in it.
SALANDER There's nothing not in it.
FRODE Your opinion of him isn't.
SALANDER I'm not paid to give my opinion.
FRODE So you don't have one?
Salander sends Armansky a weary look.
His look back begs her not to say anything unpleasant.
Eventually -
SALANDER He's clean.
SALANDER In my opinion.
FRODE He's - excuse me?
SALANDER He's honest.
SALANDER He's who he presents himself to be.
SALANDER In his business, that's an asset.
FRODE There's less in his asset column after his conviction today.
SALANDER That's true.
SALANDER He made a fool of himself with that.
SALANDER If it happened that way.
Frode looks at Armansky.
What's that supposed to mean?
SALANDER If he made up the story, that's out of character.
SALANDER So is giving up without a fight.
SALANDER People don't do things that are out of character.
FRODE Are you saying he was set up?
SALANDER That wasn't part of my assignment.
And, apparently, she has no opinion on it either.
FRODE You're quite right he made a fool of himself professionally.
FRODE How big of a fool did he make of himself financially?
SALANDER The judgement will just about empty his savings.
This seems to please Frode more than anything else that has been said, and Salander sees it.
SALANDER May I go?
FRODE Your report is light in another area.
FRODE His personal life.
FRODE Anything you chose not to include?
SALANDER Nothing that warranted inclusion.
FRODE I'm not sure if that means yes or no.
ARMANSKY I think what Ms. Salander means, and I agree, is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy, even when they're being investigated.
FRODE Not in this case.
FRODE I have to know if there's anything about him I might find unsavory - even if she doesn't.
Armansky's look to her at once apologizes for Frode, and encourages her to speak.
She finally relents but puts no more spin on it than any other piece of raw data -
SALANDER He's had a long sexual relationship with his co-editor.
SALANDER It wrecked his marriage, but not hers.
SALANDER Her husband accepts it.
SALANDER Sometimes she sleeps at Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.
Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement.
FRODE You were right not to include that.
SALANDER I know.
FRODE Anything else?
SALANDER No.
FRODE Please think before you say no.
SALANDER I did.
FRODE I don't want to be surprised by something later.
FRODE Salander offers nothing more.
FRODE So.
FRODE Nothing else.
FRODE In the personal department.
FRODE You're sure.
SALANDER He likes sandwiches.
Blomkvist isn't sentimental, but does have a few framed snapshots: his daughter, his sister, and one with Erika - in their 20's - in which he's wearing a black leather jacket.
She wakes up alone in his bed.
Pads to the darkened living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half- eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it.
ERIKA Usually when I wake up in a cold bed, it's at home.
BLOMKVIST Sorry.
ERIKA What are you doing?
BLOMKVIST Writing the press release.
ERIKA Saying -
BLOMKVIST You're taking over as publisher.
BLOMKVIST You're sorry for any nuisance Wennerstrom was caused.
BLOMKVIST I can't be reached for comment.
ERIKA You're giving up.
BLOMKVIST Just taking a few steps aside.
BLOMKVIST For you.
ERIKA This makes me sick.
Salander sits alone at a table waiting for someone with a coffee and a gift haphazardly wrapped with a Christmas bow, the price tag still on it, a paperback book - My 60 Memorable Games, by Bobby Fischer.
She notices the price tag is still on it.
Peels it off.
Dials a call on her cell.
Hangs up when it goes to voice mail.
She knocks on a door.
Hears classical music playing softly inside, but no one answers.
She tries the door.
It's unlocked.
The gift in hand, she pushes it open.
She comes into an apartment which looks like it could belong to a professor.
Sees a chess piece on the floor.
Then a trail of them that lead her to an overturned chess table and, next to it, a body.
The gash on the old man's head could have been caused by a fall into the corner of the table, or from a blow to it.
She quickly tries to determine if he's breathing.
Calls for an ambulance.
It's doubtful there's a stranger Christmas gathering going on anywhere in the world.
Standing around with eggnog are:
Blomkvist; his teenage daughter Pernilla; his sister Annika and her Italian husband; Erika and her weirdly understanding artist husband Greger, whose arm is around her waist; a few other friends (and perhaps lovers).
GREGER You needed a better attorney.
GREGER You needed your sister.
BLOMKVIST She offered.
ANNIKA He declined.
BLOMKVIST As she hoped.
ANNIKA Never a good idea mixing family and business.
BLOMKVIST And I still would have lost.
GREGOR Did you have ...
GREGOR anything on him.
BLOMKVIST I had a lot.
BLOMKVIST It just wasn't any good.
ERIKA It wasn't even about Mikael.
ERIKA It was Wennerstrom sending a message to
the press as a whole - and the FSA: Don't ask questions.
Blomkvist's daughter seems concerned for him.
BLOMKVIST I'm fine, Nilla.
BLOMKVIST You don't have to worry about me.
PERNILLA Mom's worried.
BLOMKVIST About me?
PERNILLA About all that money.
Outside the ICU, Salander sits on the floor like a dog who won't leave the spot its master told it to wait.
For the first time since we've met her, she looks vulnerable.
The doors swing open.
A doctor steps out.
Salander gets up to hear his report -
DOCTOR You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
SALANDER His ward.
SALANDER He doesn't have a daughter.
The doctor isn't sure then if he should talk to her.
SALANDER Please.
Not allowed to go inside, she peers through glass at Palmgren, who is unaware of her, or the nurse attending him, or even himself.
A spiderweb of tubes emerge from his neck and wrists; oxygen tubes from his nostrils.
DOCTOR V/O He's had severe cerebral hemorrhaging.
DOCTOR V/O Either from the fall itself, or a stroke that led to the fall.
DOCTOR V/O His blood pressure is still high.
DOCTOR V/O I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness, but that's not assured.
DOCTOR V/O And it's possible, if he does, there will be neurological damage.
They're around the dinner table now, passing platters around.
Blomkvist notices his daughter's head is bowed in silent prayer.
BLOMKVIST Nilla?
BLOMKVIST What are you doing?
PERNILLA Nothing.
BLOMKVIST You're not serious.
13. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
PERNILLA I don't want to talk about it since I know you won't approve.
BLOMKVIST Of -
BLOMKVIST Nilla.
PERNILLA Light of Life.
BLOMKVIST Light of - what?
BLOMKVIST What is that?
PERNILLA You think it's all senseless but it isn't.
PERNILLA It's more natural to believe in something than not to.
She begins eating.
Blomkvist stares at her, feeling a little sick.
A cell phone rings.
No one can tell - as you never can - whose it is, and so all pull them out.
It's Blomkvist's.
BLOMKVIST Excuse me.
Looking back at his daughter with some concern, he steps away to take the call.
BLOMKVIST Hello.
FRODE O/S Mr. Blomkvist?
BLOMKVIST Yes.
FRODE O/S Forgive me for intruding on your Christmas.
FRODE O/S My name is Dirch Frode.
FRODE O/S I'm an attorney.
FRODE O/S I represent Henrik Vanger.
FRODE O/S Perhaps you've heard of (him) -
BLOMKVIST Of course.
FRODE O/S He'd like to speak to you about a private matter.
BLOMKVIST You know, you're calling at an awkward time.
FRODE O/S I'm sorry.
FRODE O/S I'm about to sit down to Christmas dinner myself.
BLOMKVIST That's not what I mean.
FRODE O/S You're referring to your recent legal trouble.
FRODE O/S That has provided Mr.
FRODE O/S Vanger with some entertainment.
BLOMKVIST Excuse me?
FRODE O/S He doesn't care for Wennerstrom either.
FRODE O/S Frode, in his polite, deliberate way, is reeling Blomkvist in like a perch.
BLOMKVIST Have him call me.
FRODE O/S He'd like to meet in person if that's okay.
FRODE O/S Up north.
FRODE O/S Hedestad.
BLOMKVIST No.
BLOMKVIST Sorry.
FRODE O/S He's much too old to make a trip to Stockholm, Mr. Blomkvist.
FRODE O/S Please.
FRODE O/S If you'd be so kind as to consider.
FRODE O/S Blomkvist isn't sure what to do, or say.
FRODE O/S Hedestad is lovely in winter.
FRODE O/S Like a Christmas card.
Salander rides a crowded underground train, but feels even more cut off from the people around her than usual; completely alone.
A passenger train, barely visible in a severe snowstorm, makes its way north.
This is no Christmas card.
Blomkvist stares out at the bleak, northern landscape.
Blomkivist disembarks to find Frode - who he can only assume is Frode - beyond a veil of snow, waving to him from outside a Mercedes.
Unlike Blomkvist, he's dressed for this God-awful weather in a fur-collared topcoat.
Frode's Mercedes comes across a long bridge linking the old industrial town to a rocky island.
FRODE First time in Hedestad?
BLOMKVIST And last, I'm sure.
FRODE It's lovely in the spring.
BLOMKVIST You said it was lovely in winter.
FRODE This is unseasonable.
BLOMKVIST I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm.
FRODE Unless we get snowed in ...
FRODE I'm joking.
FRODE You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish.
The car comes up a long, bare-tree-lined drive, leading to a stately manor.
As Frode and Blomkvist climb out, a distant gunshot echoes, but neither Frode nor the old man who appears at the front door of the manor pays it any attention; just someone hunting.
VANGER Welcome.
VANGER Come inside.
VANGER It's warm.
It is warm inside.
There are fires in the fireplaces.
And Vanger himself is warm in nature, yet speaks quickly as they come through the house -
VANGER Thank you for coming way out here.
VANGER Anna, take Mr. Blomkvist's insufficient coat.
VANGER Would you like to freshen up?
VANGER We'll be having dinner later.
VANGER For now, hot tea is waiting.
VANGER Unless you'd like a drink instead.
VANGER What would you like?
FRODE Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm.
VANGER What?
BLOMKVIST I can't stay for dinner.
Vanger looks thoroughly disappointed.
Or hurt.
VANGER Oh.
VANGER I guess I'd better be quick then.
VANGER Thank you, Dirch.
VANGER Mikael, this way.
Tea service and pastries on a coffee table separate Blomkvist from Vanger, whose elderly frame is in danger of being swallowed up by a wing-back chair.
VANGER What do you know about me?
BLOMKVIST That you used to run one of the biggest industrial firms in the country.
VANGER Used to.
VANGER That's correct.
There are framed black and white photographs on a wall - factories and trains figuring into all of them.
VANGER My grandfather forged the tracks the 4:30 train will take you home on - and most of the other pre-state-owned rail lines.
VANGER We stitched this country together.
VANGER We made the steel and milled the lumber that built modern Sweden.
VANGER You know what our most profitable product now is?
VANGER Fertilizer.
VANGER Blomkvist imagines he's meant to offer a wistful shrug.
VANGER I'm not obsessed with the declining health of the company, but I am with the settling of accounts - and the clock is ticking.
VANGER I need your help.
BLOMKVIST Doing.
VANGER Officially, assisting me with my memoirs.
VANGER But what you'd really be doing is solving a mystery.
VANGER And you'd do that by doing what you do so well - this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding.
VANGER You'd be investigating thieves, misers, bullies, and malcontents - the most detestable collection of people you'll ever meet ...
VANGER my family.
She exhumes an unwashed bowl from a sinkful of dirty dishes, fills it with tap water without rinsing it, dumps a packet of ramen noodles in, puts it in a microwave.
She takes a Coke can from an anemically-stocked fridge to a desk in her so-called living room, a clutter of full ashtrays, fast food wrappers, empty soda cans, paperwork, unwashed laundry.
The only things of any value here are her MacBook and several external hard drives.
NOTE: Changes below are INSERTS only:
She types Dirch Frode in the search window.
Clicks on the top result which takes her to Frode's bio on Vanger Industries' site with its distinctive V.I. logo.
His official company photo accompanies his profile: Uppsala University Law School ...
Assistant Counsel, Vanger Industries, 1965-1972 ...
Head Counsel, 1972- present.
She types in another search - Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
Clicks on his Wikipedia page, which shows a photo of him alongside his bio.
She skims it - President of the investment firm, Wennerstrom-gruppen ...
personal wealth of 12 billion dollars (80 billion kronor) ...
82-foot yacht, villa on the island of Varmdo ...
She does a third search, types: Wennerstrom+Vanger Industries - and hits the `cached' option -
There are only a couple of results that include both terms.
She goes to one of them, a body of text of some old page with the cached terms highlighted in yellow and blue, and reads -
...
Hans-Erik Wennerstrom, CPA, Vanger Industries Accounting Dept., 1971-1972 ...
Hmmm.
The children of the "thieves, misers, bullies and incompetents" play on a beach.
A shutter blinks freezing a 12-year-old girl in foreground in black and white -
VANGER V/O This is Harriet.
VANGER V/O The granddaughter of my brother Richard.
The same photograph of Harriet in a photo album Vanger shows Blomkvist.
VANGER Richard, who I may as well start with to get it out of the way, was a Nazi of the first order - joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17.
A page in the album turns to reveal a photo of a young man in a uniform with a Nazi pin.
VANGER Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom.
VANGER The 4:30.
VANGER Yes.
VANGER Okay.
VANGER Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940 - missed all the real excitement - but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife Margareta and their son, Gottfried.
We see photos of Gottfried, a handsome young man.
VANGER Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father - was what people used to call a Good- Time-Charlie.
BLOMKVIST They're still called that.
VANGER Are they?
VANGER Okay.
INSERT: Close on a photo of Gottfried.
VANGER He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk.
VANGER In other words, a born salesman - which is what he did for the company - traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so on.
BLOMKVIST Someone has to do it.
VANGER That's right.
VANGER Anyway, he died in 1965.
VANGER Drowned.
VANGER Drunk.
VANGER Here on the island.
A studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children.
VANGER His wife Isabella - who was pretty much useless before as a parent - became even more so after his death - which is when I began looking after their children - Martin - who runs Vanger Industries now that I'm retired - and Harriet.
A photo of a much younger Vanger and 15-year-old Harriet.
VANGER She was bright and curious, a winning combination in any person.
BLOMKVIST And beautiful.
Vanger nods as he regards the photo ...
BLOMKVIST Something happened to her?
Vanger nods again; is silent for several moments ...
VANGER Someone in the family murdered Harriet and for the last forty years has been trying to drive me insane.
The 4:30 train leaves the station without Blomkvist.
Anna gathers the cups and leaves with the tea tray.
VANGER It was September 21st, 1966.
VANGER A Saturday.
VANGER Harriet was 16.
Three generations of Vangers dot the grounds.
VANGER V/O My brothers - along with their wives, children and grandchildren - had gathered here for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner.
VANGER V/O It was also the day the Yacht Club held its Autumn parade.
And we see the parade, and, among the spectators lining the town's main street, Harriet with other teenage girls.
VANGER V/O Harriet and a couple of school friends had gone into town to watch it.
VANGER V/O She returned a little after two o'clock.
A clock in the room reads, 2:10.
Vanger and a few family members sip afternoon cocktails.
Harriet appears.
VANGER V/O She came to the parlor.
VANGER V/O She asked if she could talk to me.
VANGER V/O I honestly don't remember what I was doing that I thought was more important, but I told her to give me a few minutes.
She leaves.
He returns to the others in the room.
VANGER V/O But in a few minutes, before I could go upstairs to talk to her, something else occurred.
A car and a fuel truck, both going too fast, collide on the bridge.
The truck rolls onto its side crushing the car and spewing gasoline.
VANGER V/O The accident had nothing to do with Harriet - and everything.
Vanger and the others react to the noise of the crash.
Out the large window they can see the bridge and many of those on the grounds trotting down to get a closer look.
VANGER V/O It was chaos as everyone dropped what they were doing.
People and vehicles converge on both sides of the bridge.
VANGER V/O Police, an ambulance, fire brigade, reporter, photographer and onlookers quickly arrived from town, as those of us on the island - the family - hurried to the bridge from our side.
22. The truck driver has managed to climb out of his cab, but the other motorist is trapped.
VANGER V/O The driver of the car - a Mr.
VANGER V/O Aronsson - was pinned and severely injured.
VANGER V/O All we could do was try to pry him out with our hands - since metal tools could spark.
VANGER V/O A local newspaper photographer and another man, snap pictures as Vanger and others try without success to pry the injured driver from his car.
VANGER V/O As the chaos ensues -
VANGER V/O About twenty minutes after the crash, Harriet was in the kitchen.
VANGER V/O Anna herself saw her.
Anna glances to Harriet as she comes in, then back out the window to the bridge.
Harriet passes a clock that reads 2:35, steps outside, walks toward the woods ...
As the sun sets, Vanger and the others on the bridge make progress extracting the driver from the car.
A young man coming from the town side takes off his jacket to help.
VANGER V/O We finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital, and those of us on our side drifted back to the house.
The family has assembled at a long dining table.
VANGER V/O The sun was down, the excitement over, we sat down to dinner.
VANGER V/O That's when I noticed Harriet wasn't there.
VANGER V/O Vanger considers an empty chair as everyone else, including the young man from the bridge, his jacket draped on his chair, passes platters of food around.
VANGER V/O And she wasn't there the next morning.
VANGER V/O Or the next.
VANGER V/O Or the next forty years.
Vanger has the same look of concern on his face now as he leads Blomkvist up some stairs.
VANGER What was she going to tell me?
VANGER Why didn't I make time for her?
VANGER Why didn't I listen?
BLOMKVIST She couldn't have run away?
VANGER Not without being seen.
The crews continue their work under lights.
VANGER Firemen stayed on the bridge all night pumping out the gasoline.
VANGER And no one swam across, or took a row boat.
VANGER All of them were still tied up on this side Sunday.
VANGER Believe me, we checked.
BLOMKVIST She couldn't have fallen and drowned?
VANGER The currents aren't strong here.
VANGER Anything that falls into the water turns up nearby.
VANGER Like her father.
VANGER His body didn't drift more than ten meters when he drowned the year before.
VANGER Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his labored breathing.
VANGER No.
VANGER Someone killed her, Mr.
VANGER Blomkvist.
VANGER Someone on the island that day.
VANGER Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday.
VANGER He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a wall.
VANGER These were from her.
And, on another wall, forty similarly-framed flowers -
VANGER These, from her killer.
Blomkvist regards the forty ...
BLOMKVIST Who knows about these?
VANGER Me, the police, the murderer ...
VANGER and now you.
It's raining as an elegantly-dressed woman slows before a luxurious apartment building.
Salander approaches from the other direction.
Passing, she notes the four number tones the woman keys in the code lock.
The door buzzes open and the woman disappears inside.
Salander doubles back and keys the same four number tones in the Milton Security lock.
Opulent foyer.
Security camera.
Antique elevator cage whose cables pull the woman upstairs.
Salander comes to an unlocked service door and takes stairs to a basement machine room.
Examines tangles of phone lines, meters, Wi-Fi routers.
Photographs them with a digital camera.
She climbs the stairs back up to the foyer.
The front door buzzes, and a man in a suit on the sidewalk pushes it open, sees her, holds it wide enough for her to pass.
The man is a driver/bodyguard.
He continues to hold the door for his employer who now emerges from the back of an idling car and crosses to it in the rain ...
Wennerstrom.
The rain here is icier and more punishing.
VANGER V/O When the police investigation petered out, I kept at it -
They're eating dinner now in the dining room.
VANGER - studying their reports and interviews, all the information there was, and it's a lot.
VANGER I've spent half my life examining the events of a single day.
And for all that, he's no closer to the truth.
BLOMKVIST I understand your frustration.
BLOMKVIST But what you're asking me to do is a waste of money.
VANGER We haven't discussed your fee.
BLOMKVIST We don't need to.
BLOMKVIST I can't find something you haven't been able to in forty years.
VANGER You don't know that.
VANGER You have a very keen investigative mind.
Blomkvist wonders why he ever agreed to come here as Vanger refills his wine glass.
VANGER Here's what I propose: You come stay on the island.
VANGER I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use.
VANGER You study the material I give you.
VANGER You find something I've missed - or you don't.
BLOMKVIST You want me to set aside my life and career for something that's a complete waste of time.
VANGER Think of it as a well deserved vacation.
VANGER A way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now.
VANGER As for compensation, I'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes.
VANGER I'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
BLOMKVIST Mr. (Vanger) -
VANGER I'm not done.
VANGER I'll throw in one more thing - even though you're a terrible negotiator.
VANGER It's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price.
VANGER I'll give it to you ...
VANGER Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
VANGER He pushes toward Blomkvist a plate: the carcass of the fresh-killed and cooked duck they've been eating.
VANGER It and the mention of Wennerstrom's name clouds, at least for a moment, Blomkvist's memory of the train he missed.
VANGER He began his career working for me.
VANGER And I've followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since.
VANGER You were right about him.
VANGER You just couldn't prove it.
Salander climbs a flight of stairs in a building that couldn't be more different than Wennerstrom's.
Knocks on a door, waits, listens to some dead-bolts unlocking.
It opens, but remains impassable by a figure weighing over 300 pounds.
He offers her no greeting.
Fades back into the shadows of his dark apartment.
PLAGUE Would you like to sit?
PLAGUE I could possibly clear a place if necessary.
PLAGUE It's hard to imagine how he or anyone might accomplish that.
PLAGUE The place is like a junkyard.
PLAGUE Even the unmade bed is covered with stuff.
SALANDER Did you make it?
PLAGUE Have you something for me?
PLAGUE She takes some cash from a pocket, hands it to him.
PLAGUE He counts it and is unimpressed with its total.
PLAGUE I'm on welfare; I don't administer it.
PLAGUE This isn't enough.
SALANDER I had to pay three months back rent and eat a little bit.
SALANDER It's all I have right now.
PLAGUE I find that so poignant.
PLAGUE So much so that he does nothing more than look at her.
PLAGUE She reaches to take the money back, but he pockets it and moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end computers fight for space with debris.
PLAGUE Finds and gives her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over in her hands.
PLAGUE While it's clear both these people are deficient in behavior that governs polite society, it's hard to tell which lacks it more.
PLAGUE No `thank you?'
Erika, first to arrive this morning, or so she thinks, comes through the empty offices with a Wayne's Coffee to- go cup - but Blomkvist is already there, packing supplies from his desk, books from his shelf.
A second suitcase, presumably full of clothes, sits on the floor.
ERIKA V/O You can't be serious -
He zips the suitcase with the supplies in it closed and gathers the rest.
ERIKA We're in our worst crisis ever and you're writing a memoir?
BLOMKVIST You fired me; I need something to do.
ERIKA You fired you; I need you here, not the North Pole.
ERIKA You know what this is going to look like.
BLOMKVIST Like I've been gutted.
BLOMKVIST Like I'm running away.
BLOMKVIST I am.
BLOMKVIST They cross through the building, he with his cases, she with her coffee cup.
BLOMKVIST Wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag, not a red one.
BLOMKVIST And the more it looks like there's a problem between you and me, the more it'll satisfy him.
ERIKA There is a problem between us.
ERIKA He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone.
He kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a statue - and steps outside.
BLOMKVIST It's four hours by train.
BLOMKVIST It's not the North Pole.
The depot thermometer reads 0.
Blomkvist disembarks with two suitcases.
This time, Frode isn't there to meet him.
He struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi stand.
As a taxi passes a gas station by the bridge, Blomkvist regards the Middle Eastern driver's eyes which regard him in the rear view mirror.
BLOMKVIST Think this snow's going to let up anytime soon?
HUSSEIN This is the North Pole.
The taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage.
From here he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses.
The taxi drives off and disappears into the snow.
Two rooms.
Fireplace.
Pile of wood.
A realtor would call it cozy.
In truth it's just tiny and freezing cold.
Blomkvist unpacks.
Puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out books, note pads, pens, CD's, a CD player, his laptop and a small printer.
He flips open his cell phone to make a call.
Gets no reception bars.
Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands a cat peering in.
He opens the door, and the cat heads straight for the kitchenette.
Then looks at him.
BLOMKVIST What.
BLOMKVIST Milk?
He opens the old fridge.
No milk.
Nothing.
He comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water.
Moves around trying to get a signal.
Can't.
He purchases milk, butter, a loaf of sliced bread, some packaged lunch meats and a few cans of cat food.
He walks along the street through wind-whipping snow, cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again.
Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever - there are no cell towers anywhere around here.
Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the end of the bridge.
It goes to Erika's voice mail.
BLOMKVIST It's me.
BLOMKVIST I'm here.
BLOMKVIST It's fucking cold and I'm on a pay phone.
BLOMKVIST If you tried to call, the reception sucks, and if you tried to email, there's none of that either, so - so - I'm here - and - I can't even speak it's so fucking cold.
He hangs up, open the same pack of cigarettes from before.
Eighteen in there.
Struggles to get one lit in the wind and snow, hurries off toward the bridge.
As the cat laps at milk on a plate, Blomkvist tries to get a fire going using pages ripped from a book.
It's a struggle he's going to lose; he's no Boy Scout.
Salander appears and keys in the four lock tones.
In the machine room again, she pulls one cable away from the others and wires to it to Plague's electronic box.
The bell in the church tower clangs -
But it's a knock that draws Blomkvist awake.
Having forgotten where he is, he regards the cat sleeping with him, then the room, and groans.
He pads to the door in the freezing cold.
Opens it to find a rugged older man on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes.
NILSSON I'm Gunner.
NILSSON The caretaker.
As Gunner expertly builds a fire in the fireplace for him, Blomkvist works at unpacking the boxes - documents, fat police reports, notebooks, folders, photo albums.
NILSSON You're an author.
BLOMKVIST I'm writing a biography of Mr.
BLOMKVIST Vanger, yes.
Nilsson nods, but isn't sure he believes it.
Maybe he took a look inside the boxes before he brought them down.
NILSSON I saw you on television.
BLOMKVIST That's unfortunate.
NILSSON Bit of trouble, I guess.
Blomkvist nods and hopes that's enough to put an end to the subject.
It isn't.
NILSSON No jail time, though.
NILSSON That's good.
NILSSON Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?
Blomkvist shares his annoyance with the cat.
Nilsson dusts himself off, satisfied with the fire he's made.
NILSSON There.
Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around the estate.
Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old man, is inadequately dressed.
VANGER The island is owned by my family.
VANGER Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe.
VANGER Two in the family.
VANGER He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him.
VANGER He's a recluse.
BLOMKVIST He was there that day?
VANGER Indeed he was.
Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds -
VANGER That's his daughter Cecilia's house.
VANGER They don't speak.
BLOMKVIST Does anyone speak to anyone on this island?
VANGER Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother - who lives there -
VANGER - she speaks to Harald - which is one of reasons I don't speak to her.
VANGER Cecilia's brother Birger lives there.
BLOMKVIST Who doesn't he speak to?
VANGER You, probably.
VANGER Not that you'd want him to.
VANGER He can be as unpleasant as Harald.
BLOMKVIST I'm quickly losing track who's who.
VANGER Oh, how you'll wish were it always so.
VANGER Soon you'll know us all only too well - with my apologies.
VANGER Out there is my nephew Martin's house; Harriet's brother.
It's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point.
BLOMKVIST Who speaks to him?
VANGER I speak to him.
VANGER He runs the company now, as I think I told you.
They hear a distant rifle crack and echo.
It startles Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger.
VANGER Someone shooting their dinner.
VANGER Gunner probably.
VANGER The caretaker.
BLOMKVIST I just met him.
VANGER He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.
Old enough, Blomkvist gathers, to be considered a suspect.
Vanger points off -
VANGER He lives over there.
Shivering in the cold, Blomkvist turns.
BLOMKVIST And you live here.
VANGER Sorry?
BLOMKVIST Your house.
For a moment, Vanger isn't sure what Blomkvist means.
Then he is, and is pleased by it.
VANGER Yes, you're right.
VANGER The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list.
A nurse takes a tray away, leaving Salander alone with Palmgren, separated by the chess table they won't playing a game on.
She wipes his mouth with her sleeve.
SALANDER I got a call from social welfare.
SALANDER I've been assigned a new guardian.
SALANDER It's unlikely he understands what she has said.
SALANDER It's unlikely he even knows she's there.
Tacked to a wall, a map of the island on which Blomkvist has written the names of the living Vanger family members and staff in the approximate locations of their houses.
Next to it - 3x5 cards and photos - a Vanger family tree - which doubles as a suspects list.
On some of the cards is the word, `deceased.' He makes a sandwich.
Refills a coffee cup.
Begins reading the police reports.
The first is a photocopy of a note when the call from Vanger came in: "Officer Morell informed by telephone of situation, 10:19 p.m."
Gustaf Morell stands at the bow of a patrol boat slowly motoring past the bridge where the fire brigade works to pump the gasoline from the overturned truck.
INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Morell on site, Hedeby Island, 11:42 p.m."
Morell, feeling like he's entered an Agatha Christie locked room mystery, regards the extended Vanger clan sitting in the living room looking suitably worried.
MORELL I'd like to see the girl's room.
VANGER It's down the hall.
MORELL I thought this was your house.
VANGER It is.
VANGER She lives with me.
MORELL Are her parents alive?
VANGER Her mother is.
Vanger points Isabella out.
Slender, overdressed and smoking a Sobranie, she immediately strikes Morell as a woman as venomous as she is beautiful.
VANGER This way.
Morell follows Vanger down a hall -
INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Approx.
12:05, inspected missing girl's bedroom.
Found - "
A purse on the desk in Harriet's room.
Morell carefully removes the contents: Comb, pocket mirror, handkerchief, wallet containing a few kronor, her ID, and her address book.
He leafs through this.
DET. MORELL I want to speak to everyone here.
DET. MORELL That'll take all night so you might want someone to put some coffee on.
YOUNGER VANGER What about the search?
MORELL First thing in the morning.
YOUNGER VANGER No.
YOUNGER VANGER We should do it now.
YOUNGER VANGER She could be hurt out there.
Vanger is either a good actor or has nothing to hide.
VANGER Please.
VANGER I beg you.
INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "authorized our patrol boat and two volunteer craft to begin 12:20 a.m.
- G. Morell."
The police patrol boat and two Peterssons motor around the island, spotlighting the shore and rocky cliffs.
The weird tableaux of characters, awaiting their interviews with Morell.
At the moment, he's across the room with Harald Vanger, taking notes, drinking coffee.
INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Patrol 014 and Orienteering Club volunteers assembled, 6:40 a.m."
Search parties crisscross the island, wade through ditches, check old barns, shine flashlights up chimneys.
Woodsmen with blood hounds comb through woods.
MORELL V/O We searched for days ...
A train bisects the landscape.
Blomkvist looks out.
MORELL V/O Eventually, much to his dismay - and mine - I had to talk to Henrik about calling it off -
As the search continues, Morell, looking like he hasn't slept - which he hasn't - peers down a rocky cliff to the water.
Somehow he knows they're never going to find her.
MORELL V/O The fact that I never found a body didn't surprise me.
MORELL V/O You can't dig up an entire island.
The same face - forty years older - the man who spoke to Vanger on the phone about the dried flowers - now speaks with Blomkvist as he scrapes out the bowl of his pipe.
MORELL But I also couldn't find a motive.
MORELL Was it spontaneous?
MORELL Was it planned?
MORELL Did she know something someone wished she didn't?
MORELL Was it about business?
BLOMKVIST Business?
BLOMKVIST She was sixteen.
MORELL And very bright.
MORELL Henrik told me he could easily imagine her running the business someday, which would mean someone else wouldn't.
BLOMKVIST She was with some friends that day.
BLOMKVIST At a parade.
BLOMKVIST You must have talked to them.
MORELL She told them she wasn't feeling well.
MORELL She left early.
MORELL But they also said she kept secrets from them, too.
MORELL The main thing I learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated.
BLOMKVIST I have one.
MORELL So you know.
MORELL Did you bring the last gift Henrik received?
BLOMKVIST It's at the National Forensic Lab.
MORELL I can tell you what their report will say now: It's a flower common to Europe.
MORELL All of them are.
MORELL No prints.
MORELL No DNA.
He lights the pipe.
Blomkvist watches the tobacco glow.
BLOMKVIST I wanted to ask you about this.
He produces an old address book from his jacket pocket.
Of course, Morell has seen it before, and handles it delicately.
The decades have dried out its pages.
37. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
MORELL She received this from Henrik the Christmas before.
MORELL I studied it more times than I can say.
MORELL I know every page of it.
BLOMKVIST It's the last page I'm curious about.
MORELL As was I.
BLOMKVIST The only names not alphabetized.
Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns to that last page.
On it, in neat handwriting: Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018
MORELL They're local Hedestad phone numbers.
MORELL The first belonged to a woman named Margot, whose mother was Magda, who claimed she didn't know Harriet.
MORELL The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died a few years before.
MORELL The other three were unconnected in any way that I could find.
He hands the address book back.
It, and everything else about the case, clearly trouble him still.
BLOMKVIST I've reminded you of things you'd rather forget.
BLOMKVIST I'm sorry.
MORELL I can't forget it.
MORELL It's my Rebecka Case.
Blomkvist isn't sure what that means.
MORELL Every policeman has at least one unsolved case.
MORELL Back then it was old Torstensson.
MORELL Year after year he kept returning to one - taking out the files - uselessly studying them.
MORELL As young men, we had to laugh.
BLOMKVIST Was this also a missing girl case?
MORELL No, that's not why I mention it.
MORELL The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born.
MORELL I'm talking about the soul of a policeman.
MORELL Poor Torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go.
And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case.
An unexciting social welfare building.
As a man behind a desk reviews a thick file, Salander reviews him: About 50; spends money on suits, thinking that might disguise his public servant status; no wedding ring; typical creep, as far as she's concerned.
BJURMAN How's Mr. Palmgren doing?
BJURMAN I was told he had a stroke of some kind.
BJURMAN Terrible.
It is, but she can tell he couldn't care less.
He leafs through her file -
BJURMAN What exactly do you do at this security company?
SALANDER Make coffee and sort mail.
BJURMAN But not full-time.
BJURMAN Not even part- time consistently.
BJURMAN They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August?
Nothing from her.
BJURMAN How much do you earn there?
SALANDER Enough.
BJURMAN How much is your rent?
39. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
SALANDER I pay my rent.
BJURMAN When's the last time you were late?
SALANDER Never.
BJURMAN Do you think that ring in your eyelid makes you attractive?
Salander, who's had to suffer insufferable officials all her life, doesn't dignify the question with an answer.
BJURMAN Here's the problem.
BJURMAN There a discrepancy between the obligation of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances.
SALANDER It isn't a discrepancy or a problem.
SALANDER It was clear to him I could manage my own finances.
BJURMAN But that's not clear to me.
SALANDER I'm not a child.
BJURMAN No.
BJURMAN You're not.
BJURMAN But you were.
BJURMAN And between then and now -
BJURMAN - two years in the locked ward at St.
BJURMAN Stephens, for violent aggression - failure to adapt to four foster homes and seven schools - arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics
use, and most recently for assault: a bottle smashed into a man's face.
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking you've improved, but looking at this -
- not to mention how you're looking at me now - I can see you haven't.
So the Good-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are over.
Starting now, you'll be given a monthly allowance.
You'll provide me with receipts for your expenses.
BJURMAN (CONT'D) If the numbers don't balance, I'll have to assume the difference is going to drugs.
SALANDER I've been on my own since I was twelve.
BJURMAN No.
BJURMAN You've been a persistent burden to the State since you were twelve.
BJURMAN She won't look at him any more - not that there's anything even remotely interesting to see if she did.
BJURMAN (CONT'D) Ms. Salander?
BJURMAN (CONT'D) Please look at me.
BJURMAN (CONT'D) Because this is important.
BJURMAN (CONT'D) She does ...
BJURMAN (CONT'D) in a way that says, I'd like to kill you.
BJURMAN This behavior you're displaying right now is elaborately documented here -
BJURMAN - so it would come as a shock to no one if I chose an alternative to the lenient arrangement I just outlined.
BJURMAN Is that what you're saying with your silence?
BJURMAN You'd prefer institutionalization?
Salander steps into the elevator, hits the down button.
As the doors close -
Martin's house didn't look so far away, but the road Blomkvist has to climb to reach it, and the fact he, like all writers, is out of shape, taxes him.
A car driven by an attractive woman in her 30's pulls alongside him.
LIV Mikael?
LIV We're going to the same place.
LIV Hop in.
Martin, wearing an apron, opens the door to find both his dinner guests on the porch.
LIV I found him at death's door halfway up the hill.
BLOMKVIST I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
MARTIN No, it's a climb for anyone.
MARTIN I should've warned you.
MARTIN Come on in.
Blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in Martin's hand.
The place is far cry from Vanger's manor.
It's modern.
Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has prepared.
Soft jazz music issues from somewhere.
LIV I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Goteborg.
LIV When it was sold, I went with it.
MARTIN A dark day.
LIV I live in Hong Kong now, but come back to Stockholm for family events, and when I do, I drive up to spend a couple days with Martin.
MARTIN She comes for the moose steak.
BLOMKVIST Is that what this is?
They all glance away to a sound: A soft, strange, wailing wind.
Martin drains the last of a bottle of wine in Blomkvist's glass and gets up.
MARTIN Something's open.
MARTIN You like this one, or would you like to try something else?
BLOMKVIST That one's good.
Martin heads off to the kitchen.
Blomkvist and Liv, left with each other, seem unsure what to talk about.
LIV I saw you on Sky News a while ago.
BLOMKVIST That was a dark day.
LIV Sorry to remind you of it.
BLOMKVIST It's okay.
BLOMKVIST There are worse things than libel - though I can't immediately think of one in my business.
LIV You're writing a book now, Martin said.
BLOMKVIST Henrik's biography.
LIV I love Henrik.
LIV He's fascinating.
LIV Martin, too.
LIV Together they're the Old Sweden and the New.
BLOMKVIST They are.
LIV You know about Harriet, right?
Blomkvist doesn't say.
The sound of the wind stops.
LIV You don't?
BLOMKVIST I do.
Martin emerges from the cellar with a bottle of wine in hand and returns with it to the dining room.
LIV O/S The family doesn't like to talk about it, but it can't just be swept under the rug.
MARTIN What can't.
LIV Harriet.
Martin doesn't comment.
Just nods.
Silence.
Then -
43. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
BLOMKVIST Maybe we could talk about that later.
MARTIN We can talk about it now.
MARTIN Liv knows everything about my crazy family.
MARTIN Which is why she'll never marry me.
LIV That's one reason.
She holds up her left hand.
A wedding ring is on it.
The couple seems very comfortable with each other, not unlike Blomkvist and Erika.
MARTIN Don't put that in your book.
MARTIN Anything else is fine.
MARTIN Harriet certainly.
MARTIN Everything changed after that.
MARTIN Not just the family, but the company.
BLOMKVIST How so.
MARTIN We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but we're still the largest family-owned company in the country.
MARTIN At the height, we had 40,000 employees.
MARTIN We have about half that now, and that downward slide - anyone can tell you - began after my sister's death.
MARTIN It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit, and his heart.
And Martin's, too, clearly.
Blomkvist dares to ask, as innocently as possible -
BLOMKVIST You were here that day?
MARTIN Everyone was here, though I didn't get in until after the accident on the bridge.
MARTIN The 4:30 train.
BLOMKVIST I know it well.
MARTIN It was a terrible day.
MARTIN And the days after - searching and not finding her - were even worse.
Liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend's.
MARTIN This event, Mikael, has to be a big part of your book.
Blomkvist promises him with a nod that it will.
As Salander moves with a crowd toward the doors of a subway car, someone behind her roughly yanks the strap of her messenger bag from her shoulder - She gives chase, pushes past people, catches up with the junkie, grapples with him.
He slugs her.
She goes down, but doesn't give up.
Catches up with him on the escalator, throws him back down it.
The bag slams onto the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now.
She doesn't run.
She waits at the top and watches the junkie drag himself up and think about trying again.
He wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator and disappears into the underground station.
Blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of Harriet's personal belongings: school papers, textbooks, a Bible, the address book, her wallet and ID ...
A knock on the door.
He puts the box in a closet on top of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch.
CECILIA Hi.
CECILIA I thought I'd come over and say hello.
CECILIA I'm Cecilia.
Cecilia regards Blomkvist's Vanger family tree on the wall.
Wherever he only has an old photo, there's a Post- It next to it that reads: Recent Photo?
INSERT of Cecilia's photo, taken when she was a teenager, and a Post-It with her name on it.
CECILIA We're all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family.
BLOMKVIST It's not about the family.
BLOMKVIST It's about Henrik and the company.
CECILIA Like I said.
BLOMKVIST It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone.
CECILIA Unlike the one that landed you in court.
BLOMKVIST Unlike that one.
BLOMKVIST Correct.
CECILIA So, what you're saying is, you're not really here to look into what happened to Harriet.
Silence.
Then -
BLOMKVIST I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus.
CECILIA So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where?
CECILIA - in the closet now?
CECILIA - weren't Henrik's private investigation.
CECILIA I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.
INSERT of the photo of Young Harald in his Nazi uniform on the wall.
BLOMKVIST Since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was Harriet like?
CECILIA I'm sure Henrik has told you.
BLOMKVIST He was my age then, and so couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than I can with my own daughter.
BLOMKVIST You were her age.
CECILIA Actually, my sister Anita was closer to her in age.
INSERT of the photo on the wall of Anita, taken when she was about 17 years old.
CECILIA She knew Harriet better than anyone - certainly better than I did.
CECILIA You should talk to her.
BLOMKVIST I'd love to, where is she.
CECILIA If I had to guess - London.
BLOMKVIST You don't know where your own sister lives?
CECILIA I haven't seen her in years.
CECILIA We never really got along.
BLOMKVIST I'm getting used to that comment.
CECILIA That's the way it is when you're always after the same boys.
BLOMKVIST People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point.
CECILIA Oh, I'm long over it, and won't ever have to worry about it again.
CECILIA She hates this place even more than I do.
CECILIA She left, moved to London and that was it.
CECILIA You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit.
BLOMKVIST I'll try to track her down for you.
CECILIA Don't bother.
BLOMKVIST For myself then.
He smiles.
She studies him.
Maybe he's not so bad.
CECILIA If you do, and try talking to her about us, don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off.
A tech tries to get beyond the dreaded blinking "?" on the laptop's cracked screen.
TECH You backed up?
SALANDER Hard drives at home, yeah.
TECH That's good.
TECH This one's dead.
Salander against the store window, cell phone to her ear.
SECRETARY V/O I'm sorry, he's booked all day.
SALANDER It'll take five minutes.
SALANDER It's important.
SECRETARY V/O Hold, please.
Salander waits.
Watches people stare at her like they always do.
The secretary comes back on.
SECRETARY V/O Seven o'clock.
Salander comes past a janitor waxing a long, otherwise empty corridor.
At the far end, she opens her new guardian's office door.
As Bjurman reviews a McJesus invoice, Salander waits.
The thick atmosphere reminds her of all the others she has sat in with school principals, shrinks and cops.
BJURMAN Have you ever had an STD?
BJURMAN When's the last time you were tested for HIV?
48. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
BJURMAN (CONT'D) How many partners have you had in the last month?
BJURMAN (CONT'D) How many were men?
That last one seems to amuse him; none amuse her.
BJURMAN I'm required to ask you these things.
BJURMAN It's a matter of health.
SALANDER Write down anything you want.
Bjurman sighs.
Sets the form aside and looks at the McJesus invoice again.
BJURMAN Why do you need such an expensive computer?
SALANDER For work.
BJURMAN Making coffee and sorting mail.
SALANDER I shouldn't even have to ask.
SALANDER I should have control of my money like before.
BJURMAN And you will.
BJURMAN Once you show me you can be sociable and get along with people.
BJURMAN Can you do that?
BJURMAN Shall we start with me?
BJURMAN Shall we start now?
As he comes around the desk, she eyes a sharp letter opener sticking out above some pens in a coffee mug a child has painted with the word, `daddy.'
BJURMAN If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you.
BJURMAN That's how normal people are.
He stands in front of her, his crotch at her eye level.
BJURMAN You've done this before.
BJURMAN You know what to do.
BJURMAN (CONT'D) Do you want this computer or not?
He takes her hand and places it on the crotch of his trousers.
BJURMAN You feel that?
BJURMAN That's gaberdine.
BJURMAN Unzip them.
BJURMAN And ...
BJURMAN And ...
BJURMAN I like the reticence.
BJURMAN I prefer a whore who pretends she isn't.
BJURMAN It's almost convincing.
He grabs her hair and roughly pulls her head toward him.
Salander eats some toothpaste in Bjurman's private bathroom.
When she returns to the office, she finds him calmly writing a check.
BJURMAN Here you go.
BJURMAN As promised.
He holds it out to her, but when she reaches for it, pulls it back a little.
BJURMAN I know you're not thinking about telling anyone about our date.
BJURMAN Enjoy your computer games.
She takes the check and leaves.
She sits cross-legged in the dark.
Thinking.
Or plotting.
The dragon tattoo visible on her bare back.
Blomkvist, who doesn't care for flying, pours two mini- bottles of vodka into a plastic cup.
He sprays Binaca in his mouth.
Then, careful to look both ways, crosses the street to an investment bank.
Blomkvist approaches a desk.
The brass name plate on it reads, Anita Vanger.
BLOMKVIST Excuse me.
BLOMKVIST I'm sure I should have made an appointment.
ANITA It's fine.
ANITA Please.
ANITA Have a seat.
The accent is all British.
She's been here much longer than her home country.
No trace of Swedish anymore.
He offers his hand -
BLOMKVIST I'm Mikael.
ANITA Mikael.
ANITA How do you do.
As he sits, she regards him a little more carefully ...
ANITA You're looking for investment counseling, Mikael?
BLOMKVIST I would if had any money to invest.
ANITA Excuse me?
BLOMKVIST I'm writing a biography of your uncle Henrik.
BLOMKVIST That's why I'm here.
She stares at him.
He waits for the response Cecilia predicted, but it doesn't come.
They sit together at a little table on the sidewalk.
ANITA How is Henrik?
BLOMKVIST Good.
BLOMKVIST Engaging.
BLOMKVIST I like him.
She does, too.
51. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
I haven't seen him in over 30 years.
Or my sister.
Or anyone else in my family.
Most of what I'm writing about predates that, so your recollections are valid.
I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question.
I can narrow it.
I've gotten up to the 1960s.
To the event that altered everything in Henrik's life.
Harriet.
Everything I knew about that I told to - whatever his name was - that policeman - when it happened.
Morell.
My recollections then were a lot better than they are now.
I'm not speaking of the crime itself.
I'm trying to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like.
Particularly, toward the end.
She was messed up.
Like all us Vanger kids.
Crazy mother.
Drunken father.
At least hers wasn't a Nazi like mine.
Was he abusive?
Mine?
Hers.
ANITA I never saw it myself, but you could tell something was going on.
ANITA One day she'd be withdrawn.
ANITA The next she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school.
ANITA The next she'd be studying a Bible like a nun - no Vanger was ever religious - can you imagine?
ANITA Obviously, she was very unhappy.
BLOMKVIST She never confided in you what about, specifically?
ANITA There was no specifically.
ANITA It was everything.
ANITA It was being part of that family.
ANITA Henrik's the only decent person in it.
BLOMKVIST What do you think happened to her?
ANITA Everyone knows what.
BLOMKVIST But you have no ...
BLOMKVIST thoughts about why, or who.
ANITA All I know is I always felt sorry for her.
ANITA Even more than for myself.
ANITA I got out of there when I was 18 and never went back.
ANITA She would have done the same but didn't make it to 18.
Salander, on a park bench, debates with herself if she wants to make the call on the cell in her hand.
She scrolls to "NB" and hits send.
It connects.
SALANDER Mr. Bjurman, please.
SALANDER It's Lisbeth Salander.
SALANDER ...
SALANDER I'm fine.
SALANDER I'm sorry I missed our appointment.
SALANDER I had a lot of work ...
SALANDER no, nothing to be concerned about ...
SALANDER I need another advance on my allowance.
SALANDER Can I come to your office tonight?
SALANDER ...
SALANDER I don't need a pen, what's the address?
The taxi that first brought him here to the island, crosses the bridge.
Again, Blomkvist regards the Middle Eastern driver, who regards him in the rearview mirror.
Outside the building's entrance with a backpack slung over her shoulder, Salander presses an apartment button.
As she waits, she notes there's no security camera.
BJURMAN O/S Yes?
SALANDER It's me.
SALANDER The door buzzes.
SALANDER She pushes it open.
She moves along a hallway with both purpose and dread.
Knocks on his door ...
It opens, revealing him in a robe.
BJURMAN Come on in.
She takes in the layout quickly: living room, dining area, kitchen, short hallway to a closed door.
BJURMAN Like it?
SALANDER It's nice.
BJURMAN It's home.
BJURMAN So, what do you need money for this time?
BJURMAN Grand Theft Auto 5?
SALANDER Food.
SALANDER He smiles.
SALANDER Steps toward her.
SALANDER Lifts her chin.
BJURMAN How are you?
BJURMAN Been thinking about last time?
BJURMAN Decided you wanted to see me again?
SALANDER I just want my money.
BJURMAN Well, let's see if I can help you out with that.
BJURMAN He walks to the hallway.
BJURMAN She doesn't.
BJURMAN He holds out his hand.
BJURMAN She finally joins him.
BJURMAN As they step into the bedroom, he roughly pushes her toward the bed.
SALANDER Wait.
SALANDER She puts her backpack and leather jacket on a chair.
SALANDER Sits on the edge of the bed.
SALANDER He stands over her.
SALANDER She knows what she's supposed to do, but seems unable to.
BJURMAN Is there a problem?
SALANDER I just want to know, am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat?
BJURMAN It's so cute when you do that surly thing.
BJURMAN Take my hand She reaches out to it and before she can react, there's a handcuff around the wrist.
BJURMAN He quickly cuffs the other to his own wrist.
BJURMAN This is bad.
BJURMAN She tries to get out.
BJURMAN He gets her in a strangle hold and chokes her into unconsciousness.
She comes to, on her stomach, sees her wrists cuffed to the headboard posts, her ankles secured to the foot posts with silk ties, and scissors slicing her jeans off.
She starts to scream and he stuffs her mouth with her underwear.
BJURMAN Please.
BJURMAN I have neighbors.
BJURMAN He lights a couple candles.
BJURMAN Switches on some New Age music.
BJURMAN What we're going to do now is teach you the value of money.
BJURMAN He watches her struggle.
BJURMAN But she's not going anywhere.
BJURMAN He tears open a condom package with his teeth.
BJURMAN I forget - did I ask you before if you liked anal sex?
BJURMAN He crams a pillow under her stomach and climbs on top of her.
BJURMAN She keeps fighting but there's not much she can do handcuffed.
BJURMAN Eventually, she retreats to another place inside herself.
BJURMAN She's had to go here before in her life; it's the only place to go in such situations.
The cat turns its head to a sound Blomkvist can't hear.
He has Harriet's box of belongings out again and looks at photos of her school friends in her wallet.
Then picks up the Bible.
Handwritten on the inside cover is Harriet Vanger.
He opens it at random.
Hebrews:
HARRIET V/O Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
HARRIET V/O Through faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God - and that what is seen was not made of things that are visible ...
HARRIET V/O He sets it down.
HARRIET V/O Rubs his eyes.
HARRIET V/O Everything - his daughter, his life, this cabin, the word of God - is depressing.
Dawn light outside the living room window.
Bjurman, at his dining table with a glass of orange juice, writing out a check.
In the bedroom, Salander slips on her leather jacket, shoulders her backpack, hobbles out to the living room.
BJURMAN I'll drive you home.
SALANDER I can get home on my own.
BJURMAN Are you sure?
BJURMAN It's bizarre: his manner seems to be one of genuine concern.
BJURMAN She nods.
BJURMAN He hands her the check.
BJURMAN Then opens the door for her like a perfect gentleman.
BJURMAN So, next Saturday, here?
56. She nods.
56. Leaves.
56. The door closes.
A lone figure hobbles through the empty streets.
She sets a check down.
On the memo line he's neatly written, "for food."
She takes a bottle of water from the fridge and drinks.
Shower water hits the dragon tattoo on her shoulder blade and runs down past several others.
By the time the water reaches the drain it has turned red.
Coming through trees with a bag of groceries, Blomkvist sees a BMW parked outside his cottage.
Blomkvist taps on the car's fogged-up driver's window.
A hand inside wipes at it, revealing Erika.
She lowers it a crack.
ERIKA Is it any warmer inside?
BLOMKVIST No.
As he tries to get some logs in the fireplace going, using more pages torn from one of his books, Erika wraps herself in a blanket.
The cat, who has no trouble with the cold, naps on the paperwork on the desk.
BLOMKVIST What have I missed besides you?
ERIKA The steady exodus of two-thirds of our advertisers.
BLOMKVIST Seriously?
ERIKA Is that hard to believe?
ERIKA Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat?
BLOMKVIST I'm not.
BLOMKVIST I'm working.
ERIKA I can see.
ERIKA What she can see is the Vanger research covering the walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top.
BLOMKVIST Would you like to meet him?
ERIKA Maybe in about an hour.
ERIKA If you're interested.
ERIKA He is.
Vanger and Martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat with Erika over dinner.
They seem charmed by her.
VANGER I apologize if you're having financial problems at the magazine in Mikael's absence.
ERIKA We'll work through them.
VANGER Are you sure?
VANGER Erika looks at Blomkvist, but he hasn't talked to them about this.
MARTIN How long do you think you can hang on?
MARTIN Six months or so?
ERIKA That sounds about right.
VANGER You know, I used to be in the newspaper business.
VANGER We owned six dailies back in the 50's.
MARTIN We still own one.
MARTIN The Courier, here in town.
VANGER I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else.
Erika nods politely.
MARTIN So what do you say to taking on a partner?
ERIKA We've never considered it before.
ERIKA We value our independence.
MARTIN Your independence is dependant on advertisers - if we're being honest.
MARTIN However much you think that is, you'd retain.
MARTIN We don't care about content.
Blomkvist suddenly feels like someone coming late to a party.
BLOMKVIST Excuse me.
BLOMKVIST Did I miss something?
VANGER We're talking about an investment in the magazine.
BLOMKVIST I gather.
BLOMKVIST Why would you want to do that?
MARTIN Not for the return, that's for sure.
VANGER I feel bad that I've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time.
VANGER This is the right thing to do.
VANGER The moral thing.
VANGER That's one reason.
ERIKA And.
VANGER The enemies of my friends are my enemies.
VANGER I hate Wennerstrom as much as you hate what he's done to you.
Silence.
VANGER So what do you say?
59. Erika half-shrugs to say she'll consider it.
VANGER Is that a maybe?
VANGER She nods.
VANGER Wonderful!
VANGER More wine, Anna.
VANGER Blomkvist looks at Erika, but she glances away to Vanger.
VANGER I think Mikael is adapting well to rustic life, by the way.
ERIKA Have you seen him try to make a fire?
VANGER Put the logs on end, like this.
VANGER He makes a teepee shape with his hands, like praying.
Erika lights a teepee of logs in the fireplace.
BLOMKVIST How long have you been discussing this with them?
ERIKA I haven't been.
ERIKA They asked me to come up yesterday.
BLOMKVIST Why didn't you tell me?
ERIKA Why would I. You live in the woods.
BLOMKVIST So I deserve to be treated like an idiot?
ERIKA I wanted to hear what they had to say.
ERIKA You would've said no before they could.
BLOMKVIST I'm saying it now.
BLOMKVIST It's not a good idea.
ERIKA You heard me tell them we could hang on for six months.
ERIKA I was lying.
ERIKA Without their money we'll be out of business in three.
BLOMKVIST You don't know this family.
BLOMKVIST They're crazy.
ERIKA We're not marrying into it.
BLOMKVIST We are if we do this.
BLOMKVIST It's exactly what we're doing.
ERIKA You want to say no?
ERIKA Let's say no.
ERIKA Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing.
ERIKA The logs crackle as flames climb them.
ERIKA She gets up, comes past him, unbuttoning her shirt as she disappears into the bedroom.
ERIKA He stares at the fire.
ERIKA O/S Mikael?
BLOMKVIST What.
ERIKA O/S I'm leaving this God-forsaken island in the morning.
BLOMKVIST So?
ERIKA So are you coming to bed or not.
Salander regards a selection of forearm tattoos: barbed wire, Celtic bands, strings of leaves and flowers.
TATTOO ARTIST You thinking one arm or both?
SALANDER Wrists and ankles.
SALANDER But none of these.
SALANDER Just a plain band, like handcuffs.
TATTOO ARTIST It's sensitive there.
TATTOO ARTIST Particularly the ankles.
TATTOO ARTIST It's gonna hurt.
TATTOO ARTIST That doesn't bother her in the least.
TATTOO ARTIST She rolls up her sleeves and watches him ready the tattoo gun.
SALANDER How much do one of those cost?
A bland financial announcer reading the news.
The graphic to the side of him is the distinctive V.I. logo of Vanger Industries.
ANNOUNCER Petrochemical manufacturer Vanger Industries has acquired a controlling interest in Millennium magazine which according to analysts has been in financial trouble since last December when its cofounder Mikael Blomkvist was found guilty of libel against Hans-Erik Wennerstrom -
A news crew has crammed itself inside Erika's office, where a reporter interviews her -
ERIKA We made a serious mistake last year, and we regret it.
ERIKA But we're moving forward, and this is the first step.
REPORTER 2 You wouldn't say the first step was your sacking of Mr. Blomkvist?
ERIKA That's inaccurate.
ERIKA Read the original press release, Viggo.
ERIKA I didn't fire him.
ERIKA He's on sabbatical.
REPORTER 2 Where.
ERIKA I'm not sure, to be honest with you.
He's at his desk, the cat in his lap, reviewing the album of photos taken on the day Harriet disappeared.
62. They're arranged chronologically, and Vanger has noted the approximate time of day of each.
62. The first several were taken on the manor grounds, by family members of each other.
62. The next couple taken in town of the parade.
62. Then dozens taken on and around the bridge of the dramatic accident.
62. He hears the sound and glances out to see a television news van driving toward Vanger's manor -
A crew is set up in the yard by the water, interviewing Henrik and Martin.
Under his suit jacket Henrik wears a cheerful yellow shirt.
Birger unhappily looks on.
MARTIN Millennium is an excellent magazine.
MARTIN We also think it's undervalued right now, which is good business for us.
REPORTER 3 Is any magazine really undervalued today.
REPORTER 3 How many will be around tomorrow?
VANGER There's another reason.
VANGER I don't like bullies.
REPORTER 3 Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?
VANGER I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue their enemies into submission.
VANGER If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try it again, he'll find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back.
REPORTER 3 You're enjoying this.
VANGER Already it's the most fun I've had in years.
As a clerk rings up the items Salander is buying - bright yellow duct tape and a plastic protective mask - she watches a shot on a TV here of Wennerstrom being interviewed outside his offices -
WENNERSTROM ON TV I've always admired Henrik Vanger.
WENNERSTROM ON TV He's a titan - and a gentleman.
WENNERSTROM ON TV But he's also quite old now - which may explain how he could be taken in by a convicted liar.
WENNERSTROM ON TV The report segues to another story.
WENNERSTROM ON TV The clerk hands Salander her receipt.
Her hardware store purchases, along with some fresh DVD- R's, a couple of plastic bottles of ink, and McDonald's Kids Meal wrappers, sit by her laptop.
She's not typing on its keyboard, but characters are appearing nonetheless as someone somewhere else, writes an email: The From box reads: h wennerstrom <HEW@WG.com>
The To box reads: l jansson <LDJ@SkLaw.com The Subject box reads: Vanger/Blomkvist
And the Message, which is being typed:
Can somebody please explain to me what the fuck is going on with these two assholes -
Blomkvist has returned to the accident photos.
Pauses on a blurry one of the fire crew, the focus inadvertently on the background - Vanger's manor.
What caught his attention is a figure in one of the upstairs windows.
He checks a scribbled floor plan of the manor and sees that it's Harriet's bedroom.
But he's not sure if it's Harriet.
The figure is too soft to identify - even with a magnifying glass - but is wearing a light-colored dress and has light hair.
He glances to the family tree on the wall - the teenage Vanger girls' photos -
Three INSERTS: Harriet ...
Cecelia ...
Anita ...
They all have light hair, and, frankly, all look alike.
He moves on to the parade pictures.
To the one Vanger said before was the last picture taken of Harriet alive.
It's not really of her.
64. It's a wide shot of the parade itself - but she can be seen in the background across the street with her friends, watching a float - atop which some women in harem outfits dance - pass by.
64. He slips it from its corner-fasteners and turns it over.
64. There's a Hedestad Courier copyright printed on the back.
64. He turns it over again and looks at the photo itself.
Guided by the photo, he walks along the town's main street to the approximate place from which it was taken - outside a haberdashery window - but it's still not right.
The photo was shot from a higher than street level angle.
He looks to a second story window above the store.
Then crosses the street to where Harriet was standing when the picture was taken.
Looks back at the haberdashery where, now, the owner peers out at him.
On the pay phone outside the gas station -
BLOMKVIST I want to look at what the paper has in its archive on the parade.
VANGER V/O You already have what it has.
VANGER V/O In the album.
BLOMKVIST I don't think so.
VANGER V/O Why.
BLOMKVIST Because no photographer at any newspaper in the world takes just two photos of anything - especially after having to climb a flight of stairs.
VANGER V/O The bridge accident happened during the parade.
VANGER V/O He rushed over.
BLOMKVIST Maybe.
BLOMKVIST Silence.
BLOMKVIST Then -
VANGER V/O Mikael, what have you found?
BLOMKVIST Nothing probably.
BLOMKVIST But I know photographers.
BLOMKVIST They're the most insecure people on earth.
BLOMKVIST If it's out of focus, or they don't like the framing, they bury it.
Blomkvist follows the paper's youngish photo editor up narrow stairs to an attic.
PHOTO EDITOR The current archive is on CD's, naturally.
PHOTO EDITOR The older stuff, still negatives.
PHOTO EDITOR What general period are you interested in?
BLOMKVIST September, 1966.
BLOMKVIST She glances back at him.
BLOMKVIST The date means something to her, but she chooses not to comment.
She pulls four thick binders off a shelf from September 1966 alone, proving Blomkvist's point about photographers - and piles them up next to a light-box and scanner.
BLOMKVIST Thank you.
BLOMKVIST He waits for her to leave.
BLOMKVIST She seems reluctant to ...
PHOTO EDITOR Is this about Harriet Vanger?
BLOMKVIST You're too young to know about that.
PHOTO EDITOR Everyone here grows up knowing about her.
PHOTO EDITOR It's how we're taught about strangers.
The door opens revealing Salander.
Bjurman seems a little surprised to see her at his doorstep.
BJURMAN My dear Lisbeth, how are you?
SALANDER I need more money.
SALANDER I need to pay my rent.
SALANDER She looks like a schoolgirl with her little backpack over her shoulder.
SALANDER How did he ever get so lucky?
BJURMAN Come on in.
BJURMAN She steps inside.
BJURMAN He takes her hand and leads her toward the bedroom.
BJURMAN Her other hand slips into her jacket pocket.
BJURMAN Since we're still figuring out what you like, I went shopping for some new toys.
SALANDER Me, too.
BJURMAN You, too?
BJURMAN What did you buy?
BJURMAN She pulls a Taser from her pocket and jams it under his chin, firing off 75,000 volts -
Set down on the rugged landscape under an almost moonless night sky, the cottage looks vulnerable.
The cat, curled up on a chair, jerks its head up at a sound neither we nor Blomkvist can hear, and stays absolutely still, listening.
Blomkvist scrolls through the Courier negatives he has converted into positives and has loaded into Photoshop.
He was right.
Many more parade pictures were shot that day.
Several at street level - a marching band, floats, children with balloons, some in better focus than others.
He reaches the first of the higher-angle shots from the floor above the haberdashery, scans the crowd lining the street.
Harriet isn't in it.
But in the next she appears at the edge of the frame with her school friends.
In the next, she's further into frame.
And the next, standing in the same spot he stood earlier today.
Blomkvist selects all 18 of the high-angle parade photographs, transfers them to an iPhoto file, and reopens them as a `slide show.' The first few, accompanied by the default music, Minuet in G, dissolve at two-second intervals.
Too long.
Too distracting with the music.
And too wide.
He adjusts the size function - closer on Harriet gets rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time- interval to make the transitions as quick as possible.
He hits `play' again and watches a short jerky `silent film'- a kind of electronic flip-book:
Harriet arrives with her friends.
Moves along the street.
Stops and faces the parade.
Says something to her friends.
Laughs.
Watches the float with the harem girls on it.
Smiles.
Sees something to her left.
Turns her head slightly toward it.
Her eyes widen in fear.
She looks down.
She moves off.
Her friends look after her confused.
And then she's gone.
Blomkvist backs up to the frame of Harriet looking off with fear in her eyes, and for the first time believes without a doubt what Vanger has believed for 40 years:
She was murdered.
Whoever she saw across the street followed her and killed her.
The cat watches him.
Bjurman slowly comes to.
SALANDER Good.
SALANDER You're alive.
SALANDER It takes him a moment to realize it's true.
SALANDER Another to realize it might be better if he wasn't since he's naked on the floor, face-up, wrists and ankles bound.
SALANDER He tries to cry out and realizes he's also gagged.
SALANDER She emerges from the shadows, stands over him, and he sees that her eyes are ringed in black mascara like some kind of ghoulish raccoon.
SALANDER She looks insane.
SALANDER As she steps out of his field of view, and his hands struggle against the restraints.
SALANDER Recognize this?
SALANDER He cranes his neck to see she's by her backpack that's resting on a chair.
SALANDER I had it with me last time.
SALANDER I set it here.
SALANDER Remember?
SALANDER See this snap?
SALANDER It's not a snap.
SALANDER It's a wide-angle micro-lens.
She takes a DVD-R from the backpack, puts it in his player, flips his plasma TV on with a remote.
She got it all - what he did to her - the rape - in HD.
SALANDER This shows you sodomizing a mentally impaired girl.
SALANDER If it's ever seen outside this room, who'll be institutionalized then?
He starts to whimper.
SALANDER Here's what's going to happen.
SALANDER Pay attention.
He can't.
He can't even look at her.
His life is over.
He weeps into the gag.
SALANDER Look at me.
He won't.
She strides to her backpack.
Takes out a large dildo.
Gets on her knees, and works it into his ass.
She can only get it about halfway up.
She has to stand up and kick it the rest of the way with her boot.
He howls into the gag.
SALANDER Do I have your attention now?
She does indeed.
He vigorously nods his head, now, and after everything she says -
SALANDER When you can walk again, which I admit could be a while, we're going to my bank.
SALANDER You'll tell them I alone have access to my account.
SALANDER After that, you'll never contact me again.
SALANDER Each month you'll write a report of a meeting we won't have.
SALANDER You'll describe how well I'm doing, how sociable I'm becoming.
SALANDER Then you'll negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted.
SALANDER If you fail, this video will spread across the Internet like a virus.
SALANDER (CONT'D) If something happens to me - if I get hit by a car - if you hit me with a car - same thing, it uploads automatically.
She fishes his apartment keys from his trousers.
Shows him that she has them.
SALANDER I'm taking these with me.
SALANDER I'll be checking on you.
SALANDER If I ever find anyone in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not -
His eyes dart to the TV as he nods that he understands.
SALANDER No.
SALANDER Not the video.
She kicks him.
Then straddles his fat gut and looks him in the eye.
SALANDER I will kill you.
And he knows she means it.
SALANDER Do you doubt anything I've said?
SALANDER Do you doubt what's in the reports about me?
SALANDER What do they say when you sum them up?
SALANDER They say I'm insane.
SALANDER No, it okay.
SALANDER You can nod because it's true.
SALANDER I am insane.
She gets up off him, rummages through her backpack again.
SALANDER I know it'll be hard for you to abide by my rules.
SALANDER Especially no more sex.
SALANDER I'm going to make it easier for you.
She puts on a plastic surgical mask.
He fears the next thing he'll see is a pair of scissors in her hand, but it isn't.
It's something else he doesn't recognize.
She straddles him again.
He squirms under her weight.
SALANDER Lie still.
SALANDER I've never done this before.
70. He sees that the thing in her hand is some kind of surgical device, a shiny stripped-down gun with a sharp point and a plastic ink bottle where the bullets would go.
SALANDER There will be some blood.
SALANDER He struggles to twist his body away, but it's useless.
SALANDER She digs the tattooing gun's needle into his chest and begins dragging it back and forth.
SALANDER He screams as dots of blood spatter her plastic mask ...
The job has taken her all night.
The sky outside the living room window is beginning to lighten.
She drinks a glass of water in the kitchen, wipes her prints from it.
She crosses to the bedroom where Bjurman's toys have been wiped cleaned and put back in the dresser.
Picks up her backpack.
Looks at him.
He's unconscious.
She sets handcuff key next to a dark stain on his stomach.
We stay on the key as she leaves the room.
Hearing the front door open and close, we rise up to see his entire naked body on the bed.
Tattooed into his skin in big letters, from his nipples to his groin, is:
Returning from a walk and a smoke, Blomkvist sees - sitting outside the cottage, petting his cat - Harriet.
Of course it can't be her, but it is a teenage girl who resembles the old pictures of her.
Seeing him, she waves.
It's his daughter.
PERNILLA Hi.
BLOMKVIST Hi.
BLOMKVIST What are you doing here?
PERNILLA On my way to Skelleftea.
PERNILLA I can only stay a couple hours.
PERNILLA He arrives and gives her a hug.
BLOMKVIST What's in Skelleftea?
PERNILLA Light of Life Bible Camp.
PERNILLA Blomkvist tries to hide his dismay.
He's made them some coffee, and, of course, sandwiches.
Patiently waits for her to finish her silent prayer, and smiles bravely.
PERNILLA They're not dangerous.
BLOMKVIST It's fine, Nilla.
BLOMKVIST Whatever you want to do is fine.
BLOMKVIST Everybody needs something.
PERNILLA Just so long as it's not God.
BLOMKVIST I didn't say that.
BLOMKVIST As they eat in silence, Blomkvist can't help but think about Harriet and what Vanger said about not giving her his attention when she needed it.
BLOMKVIST I'm not around enough to know everything that's going on with you, and I apologize for that.
BLOMKVIST But I'd never want you to not tell me something, even if you think I might not want to hear it.
PERNILLA That's what I'm doing.
The afternoon train is boarding.
It's not crowded.
BLOMKVIST It should have been me visiting you.
BLOMKVIST I'm sorry.
PERNILLA It's okay.
PERNILLA Everything's good.
72. He nods but doesn't believe it any more than she believes he's okay with Bible Camp.
72. She climbs aboard.
72. Waves.
PERNILLA Bye.
BLOMKVIST Bye.
BLOMKVIST The train begins to move.
PERNILLA Don't go too hard on the Catholics.
BLOMKVIST What?
PERNILLA The article you're writing.
BLOMKVIST What are you talking (about) -
PERNILLA The Bible quotes on your desk.
BLOMKVIST What?
BLOMKVIST The train clears the platform.
BLOMKVIST He watches after it.
BLOMKVIST What was she talking about?
BLOMKVIST He glances absently to the taxi stand.
BLOMKVIST Hussein points to his taxi.
BLOMKVIST Ride?
Blomkvist comes in, goes straight to his desk, sifts through the paperwork on it, then sees the Xerox of the last page of Harriet's address book - the unknown phone numbers - he taped to the lamp -
Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018 It could be a coincidence they're Bible names - Magdalene, Sarah, Mary - or maybe not.
He digs through Harriet's personal things for her Bible.
Since all the number sequences begin with `3,' he goes to the third chapter - Leviticus - notices that its first facing page is faintly dog-eared - finds R.J's verse - 1:14 - on it:
HARRIET V/O If a dove is the sinner's offering, the priest shall wring off its head, cleave its wings, and burn it upon the altar.
Pinching a cigarette in a shaking hand, Blomkvist pokes numbers on his cell phone.
Instead of ringing he hears a beep.
"Retry?" appears on the cell screen.
Back across the bridge by the gas station, he makes the call on the pay phone.
BLOMKVIST Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist.
MORELL O/S How are you?
MORELL O/S Not still in Hedestad I hope for your sake.
BLOMKVIST The Rebecka Case you mentioned.
BLOMKVIST What was her last name if you recall.
MORELL O/S Of course I do, but what would it have to do with anything?
BLOMKVIST Nothing probably.
BLOMKVIST As Blomkvist glances to the last page in Harriet's address book, to R.J. 30114 -
MORELL O/S Jacobsson.
MORELL O/S Rebecka Jacobsson.
BLOMKVIST How was she killed?
MORELL O/S Decapitated.
MORELL O/S Arms cut off.
MORELL O/S Burned.
MORELL O/S Like the Leviticus dove.
MORELL O/S A siren.
MORELL O/S Ambulance coming past, headed for the bridge.
MORELL O/S But this happened in the 1940's -
BLOMKVIST Hang on a second.
BLOMKVIST He watches the ambulance speed across the bridge.
BLOMKVIST I'm going to call you back.
MORELL O/S What have you (found) - Blomkvist hangs up and takes off at a trot toward the bridge -
He reaches the manor just as the ambulance is leaving and Martin is climbing into his Range Rover.
He looks undone.
BLOMKVIST What's happened?
MARTIN We were talking.
MARTIN He started rubbing at his arm.
MARTIN Then collapsed.
BLOMKVIST Is he (conscious) -
MARTIN I can't talk, Mikael, I have to (go) -
BLOMKVIST Go.
BLOMKVIST Martin pulls out to follow the ambulance to the hospital.
BLOMKVIST Blomkvist watches after them.
The cat naps while Blomkvist looks up the other Leviticus quotes from Harriet's list in her dog-eared Bible -
HARRIET V/O The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father, and shall be burned with fire -
HARRIET V/O A woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning -
HARRIET V/O There's a knock.
HARRIET V/O He tucks the list in the Bible, sets aside and answers the door.
HARRIET V/O Frode comes in.
FRODE The good news is he survived.
FRODE How he does now, we have to see.
FRODE He's in ICU.
FRODE Can I have one of those?
He points to the table.
BLOMKVIST A sandwich?
FRODE A Scotch.
Blomkvist pours him one, and another for himself.
BLOMKVIST I don't want to be indelicate.
BLOMKVIST But Henrik promised me something when I agreed to do this.
FRODE Wennerstrom.
BLOMKVIST I need to know what he has on him.
BLOMKVIST Now.
BLOMKVIST In case.
FRODE In case he dies?
FRODE That is indelicate.
BLOMKVIST And I apologize.
FRODE I don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me.
FRODE And he can't tell you in the condition he's in.
FRODE So ...
FRODE is that it then?
Silence.
Blomkvist drinks.
Eventually -
BLOMKVIST We also never discussed who I'd report to if something happened to him.
FRODE You'd report to me, but does it matter?
FRODE We both know nothing's going to come of this.
BLOMKVIST I'm not so sure.
Frode looks at Blomkvist a little more intently.
FRODE What do you mean?
BLOMKVIST I may have found something.
FRODE You're joking.
FRODE What did you find?
Now it's Blomkvist who studies Frode.
He's not sure he wants to tell him.
And even less so the longer he looks.
BLOMKVIST The last time I reported something before I was sure of it, it cost me my savings.
Frode studies him again - wondering perhaps if Blomkvist suspects him.
BLOMKVIST I need a research assistant.
BLOMKVIST Can you authorize that?
FRODE Yes.
FRODE Do you have one?
BLOMKVIST I can find one.
FRODE I know a good one.
FRODE She did the background check on you.
BLOMKVIST The.
FRODE Do you think we'd hire anyone for something like this without doing one?
Blomkvist's brain tries to quickly inventory his life, pausing at its darker recesses.
Frode nods.
FRODE Yes, it was quite thorough.
BLOMKVIST I want to read it.
FRODE That I couldn't authorize.
77. Blomkvist isn't sure how to play this.
77. Then he is.
77. Sets his napkin down, gets up and begins taking things down from the wall.
77. Frode watches.
77. Then sighs.
Only a few lights on in the Milton Security building.
It isn't often a subject of an investigation shows up in his office, but is always awkward when one does.
BLOMKVIST Mr. Frode was kind enough to share your report with me.
BLOMKVIST The investigator's name is on it, but I can find no record of her, and I'm pretty good at that sort of thing.
ARMANSKY Would it really matter what her name is?
BLOMKVIST It would if I wanted to speak to her, which I do.
ARMANSKY Against policy.
BLOMKVIST You sure?
ARMANSKY Just like your sources.
ARMANSKY You understand.
BLOMKVIST Let me give you a name then.
BLOMKVIST He jots "Annika Giannini" on one of Armansky's Post-Its.
BLOMKVIST My sister.
BLOMKVIST She's a lawyer.
BLOMKVIST There's information in here that could only have come from one place.
BLOMKVIST I think you know what I mean.
BLOMKVIST Silence.
BLOMKVIST Armansky tries not to look sick.
BLOMKVIST Then -
ARMANSKY The reason you can find no record of her is because her records have been sealed.
ARMANSKY She's a ward of the State.
BLOMKVIST What does that have to do with anything.
ARMANSKY She's had a rough life.
ARMANSKY Can we not make it rougher on her?
ARMANSKY Blomkvist just sits there, the picture of calm ...
Cacophony of loud techno and a fringe clientele.
Alone at a table drinking, Salander seems comfortable with the noise and her dateless status, but doesn't avoid a glance from an Asian girl at the bar, and doesn't tell her to go away when she comes over and motions to the empty chair.
Salander and the girl from the club, asleep in bed, entwined like snakes.
Salander wakes, disentangles herself, and is padding to the bathroom when there's a knock on her door.
She stares it.
No one ever knocks on her door.
But someone knocks on it again.
She crosses to it, wrapping herself in a blanket.
SALANDER Who is it?
BLOMKVIST O/S Mikael Blomkvist.
BLOMKVIST O/S Her mind races, as Blomkvist's did to the news someone had invaded his privacy.
BLOMKVIST O/S She unlocks the door.
BLOMKVIST O/S Cracks it enough to see him.
BLOMKVIST O/S He smiles, but it's disconcerting.
BLOMKVIST O/S She's not sure it's a harmless one.
BLOMKVIST May I come in?
SALANDER Actually I'm not really up (yet) -
BLOMKVIST That's okay.
79. He pushes the door enough to pass.
79. Has a paper bag and satchel with him.
79. Takes in the place, including the girl in the bedroom, in a glance as he heads for the kitchen.
BLOMKVIST I assumed you wouldn't have had breakfast yet so I brought some bagel sandwiches.
BLOMKVIST And tomato juice.
BLOMKVIST Good for hangovers.
BLOMKVIST Where do you keep the coffee?
SALANDER Hey.
SALANDER Hey -
SALANDER Who do you think you are?
BLOMKVIST I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do.
BLOMKVIST He opens cabinets looking for the coffee.
BLOMKVIST She stares.
BLOMKVIST We have a lot to talk about, so why don't you take a shower, put on some clothes and get rid of your girlfriend.
Blomkvist, plunging a French press, watches as the girlfriend lets herself out.
In the bedroom, Salander finishes getting dressed, sticks her Taser in the back pocket of her jeans and comes out to find a table setting that's more formal than she, or anyone who lives alone, is used to.
BLOMKVIST You're awake.
BLOMKVIST Good.
BLOMKVIST Breakfast is ready.
BLOMKVIST He pours her, and then himself, coffee.
BLOMKVIST I guess I alarmed you showing up like this.
SALANDER If you touch me, I'll more than alarm you.
BLOMKVIST That won't be necessary.
BLOMKVIST He smiles.
BLOMKVIST His eyes are not unkind.
BLOMKVIST As he helps himself to one of the bagels -
BLOMKVIST Your report on me was quite detailed but for me not very entertaining.
BLOMKVIST A copy of it sits next to his plate.
SALANDER It wasn't meant to be.
BLOMKVIST When I write about people, I try to entertain the reader.
SALANDER Wennerstrom wasn't entertained.
SALANDER Blomkvist lets it go.
BLOMKVIST Your boss Armansky tells me you only work on things that interest you.
BLOMKVIST I guess I should be flattered.
BLOMKVIST He also says you're the one he goes to for jobs that are, `sensitive' is the word he used.
BLOMKVIST I'll use `illegal,' since that what it was when you hacked into my computer.
BLOMKVIST I'm not going to do anything about that.
BLOMKVIST I could but I won't.
BLOMKVIST What I'm going to do is tell you a story.
BLOMKVIST If it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research it further.
BLOMKVIST If it doesn't, I'll wash the dishes and leave ...
BLOMKVIST Are you going to even touch your food?
SALANDER What kind of research?
BLOMKVIST Lisbeth - may I call you Lisbeth?
BLOMKVIST I want you to help me catch a killer of women.
He's arranged some of his research on the floor, and watches Salander kneeling before it, her eyes passing over photographs of the Vanger clan, the accident on the bridge, Xeroxes of the Leviticus list and verses.
BLOMKVIST I've identified R.J. Her name's Rebecka Jacobsson.
BLOMKVIST (CONT'D) I have no idea who the others are - or how they're connected to the death of a 16 year old girl - but they have to be.
BLOMKVIST (CONT'D) His eyes settle on her blue-black "handcuffs" as hers
settle on a copy of an old Hedestad Courier front page: the article about the grisly murder of Rebecka Jacobsson.
BLOMKVIST We need to somehow figure out who they are, what happened to them, what the Leviticus verses have to do with (anything) -
BLOMKVIST She gets up, goes to her desk, begins jotting something down, ignoring him.
BLOMKVIST What are you doing?
SALANDER Getting started.
SALANDER You can keep talking if you want.
SALANDER Blomkvist, slightly taken aback, picks up the Leviticus Xerox from the floor.
BLOMKVIST Would you like this?
SALANDER Got it.
SALANDER That's what she's jotting down, from memory: the names, initials and Leviticus numbers.
SALANDER She wakes her laptop -
Hussein's taxi brings Blomkvist across to the island.
He gets out with his satchel.
Whistles for the cat -
BLOMKVIST I'm home.
BLOMKVIST He picks up the bowl of food he left on the porch, unlocks the door, goes inside, and sees the cat napping on his desk.
BLOMKVIST He stares at it.
BLOMKVIST Then at the door he just came through.
BLOMKVIST Then the windows: all shut.
82. Nothing has been disturbed as far as he can tell, but someone has been in here.
A window on Salander's laptop shows a map of Sweden divided into its 21 counties: Stockholm, Vasterbotten, Uppsala, etc.
She starts with Skane.
Hacks *however one does that* into its police department's crime database (or various county newspapers' databases).
She fills in the year field with - 1947-1966 - and continues to types quickly.
When we see what that is, she's in the middle of typing this filters list - Homicide Female Rape Decapitation Dismemberment Fire Altar Priest Prostitute Unsolved Mari Magda Sara
R.L. The search produces a screen showing matches to some of the filter words - the rest of the case synopses greyed
out.
But also, with all of them, there's this message:
Full Police Report Not Digitized
Blomkvist watches a Hedestad locksmith install a dead- bolt on his front door.
Salander comes out of her apartment building onto an empty street.
Everyone is asleep.
No lights on.
It must be about 3am.
She ties a duffel bag down, climbs onto the motorcycle, kick-starts it, races off into the night.
Salander's Honda races past a pastoral agricultural landscape.
An old police detective considers Salander's driver's license, her Milton Security ID, and a letter signed by the giant security firm's CEO, Dragan Armansky.
DET. ISAKSSON No one's asked me about Magda in over 40 years.
DET. ISAKSSON No one here even remembers her.
DET. ISAKSSON He waits for her to say something, but she doesn't seem to understand conversational dynamics, so it's up to him.
DET. ISAKSSON Why would a young lady like you want to know about such a brutal killing.
SALANDER It interests me.
DET. ISAKSSON Does it.
DET. ISAKSSON She nods.
DET. ISAKSSON He's not sure which he finds stranger - her appearance or her sincerity.
DET. ISAKSSON He touches his own neck to indicate the tattoo on hers.
DET. ISAKSSON What's that.
DET. ISAKSSON A wasp?
SALANDER A friend of mine calls me that.
DET. ISAKSSON So you tattoo it on your neck?
DET. ISAKSSON He'd be horrified if one of his grandchildren did that, but she just shrugs like it's no big deal.
DET. ISAKSSON Who's this friend?
SALANDER My trainer.
DET. ISAKSSON Aerobics?
SALANDER Boxing.
SALANDER Hard for him to picture.
SALANDER But, upon reflection -
DET. ISAKSSON I have a feeling you're pretty good at that, even though you weigh - what - ninety pounds?
DET. ISAKSSON Float like a butterfly ...
SALANDER What?
DET. ISAKSSON Come with me, Muhammad.
The old man rummages through an old file cabinet.
DET. ISAKSSON Her husband was our first suspect - the husband is always the first suspect, and usually the last - but not this time.
DET. ISAKSSON We moved on to a neighbor.
DET. ISAKSSON Then a vagrant -
DET. ISAKSSON He pulls a thick, yellowed folder out and sits with it and her at a table.
DET. ISAKSSON Once you get to strangers, it's only a matter of time before you get to gypsies, and you know you're never going to solve it.
DET. ISAKSSON And that troubles him still, that he never solved it.
SALANDER How exactly was she killed?
DET. ISAKSSON Miss - I'm sorry -
SALANDER Salander.
DET. ISAKSSON Miss Salander, if you don't mind my asking, when's the last time you ate?
SALANDER I have a high metabolism.
SALANDER I can't put on weight.
DET. ISAKSSON That's not why I ask.
DET. ISAKSSON I ask because it's better to look at what I'm about to show you on an empty stomach.
DET. ISAKSSON He pushes the folder across the table to her ...
Blomkvist comes in to find - like Morell did 40 years ago - a strange tableaux of suspects - two of whom he's only yet seen in photographs on his cottage wall - Birger, Cecilia, Frode, Martin, Gunnar, Anna, and, looking like an aging overdressed vampire, Isabella, smoking a cigarette.
BLOMKVIST How is he?
BLOMKVIST Frode takes Blomkvist aside.
FRODE He needs surgery and there's no DNR.
FRODE So it's up to the family to decide to resuscitate or not, and they're not good at decisions.
FRODE He glances over to them.
FRODE Isabella's staring back.
FRODE How'd it go with Ms. Salander?
BLOMKVIST She said yes.
BLOMKVIST Isabella gets up to come over -
BLOMVIST Can I see Henrik?
FRODE He was asleep when I last looked in.
FRODE We can check.
ISABELLA No, you can't check.
ISABELLA You can instruct him to pack his things and leave.
MARTIN Mother -
ISABELLA Don't use that tone with me.
ISABELLA This family's had enough tragedy without you dredging it all up again.
FRODE Actually, Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik.
ISABELLA And who do you work for, Dirch?
ISABELLA Remind me who pays your salary?
BIRGER We should put this to a vote.
MARTIN Don't be an idiot, Birger.
BIRGER It's a family decision like any other.
BIRGER Cecilia?
CECILIA What.
BIRGER Am I right?
CECILIA You are so seldom right about anything, it's hard for me to say yes.
CECILIA But (yes) -
MARTIN No.
MARTIN We should do what Henrik wants, and we know what he wants.
ISABELLA Henrik - is in there fighting for his life.
ISABELLA This - (points to Blomkvist like he's an object) - is the last thing he needs.
A nurse chooses this - the absolute worst time - to approach Isabella.
NURSE O/S Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger, you can't smoke in here.
NURSE O/S Isabella gives the nurse a look so hard it's almost frightening - calmly flicks an ash on the floor - waits for the nurse to leave - and looks back at Blomkvist.
ISABELLA Go back to Stockholm.
ISABELLA When we want a false chronicle of the family written by a libelist, we know who to call.
As Frode guessed, Henrik is asleep, wired up to monitors, and doesn't stir as Blomkvist looks in on him.
Salander's motorcycle parked outside.
As young travelers with huge backpacks try to sleep around her, Salander reads to herself from a Bible by flashlight.
Leviticus 4:32 -
HARRIET/PERNILLA If a man's offering is a lamb, it shall be a female without blemish.
HARRIET/PERNILLA He shall lay his hand upon it's head ...slaughter it...
HARRIET/PERNILLA empty it's blood on the base of the altar ...
HARRIET/PERNILLA and he shall be forgiven.
Another police station.
Det.
Isaksson is on the phone -
DET. ISAKSSON Forget what she looks like, I vouch for her -
Another old police detective has Salander's credentials and a phone in hand -
DET. ISAKSSON O/S She's smart.
DET. ISAKSSON O/S And she's serious about this.
88. The old Uddevalla detective regards Salander waiting at the counter.
88. Into the phone -
UDDEVALLY DETECTIVE All right.
UDDEVALLY DETECTIVE Thanks.
UDDEVALLY DETECTIVE He hangs up.
UDDEVALLY DETECTIVE To Salander -
UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE This way, Miss.
UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE He escorts her to the file room.
Just like Isaksson, the Uddevalla detective pulls open an old cabinet drawer, finds a particular ancient folder in it and hands it to Salander.
She begins flipping through the reports and crime photos inside it, but we don't see them.
SALANDER Can I make copies?
UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE I can make them for you if our machine's been repaired.
SALANDER That's okay.
SALANDER She begins photographing the reports and crime scene pictures with her camera as the detective watches her, not without some kind of strange sense of admiration.
Blomkvist considers Birger's photo on his wall: Brother of Cecilia, son of Harald the Nazi, 21-years-old when his cousin Harriet disappeared ...
Blomkvist and Martin drink Skane.
Martin's normally breezy demeanor seems to have suffered from his mother's public displays.
Embarrassed by them and her, he's more serious now.
MARTIN My family is impossible.
MARTIN It's why the company is such a mess.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Please accept my apology for my mother's behavior.
BLOMKVIST It's all right.
MARTIN It's not all right, she's unbearable.
MARTIN But it has nothing to do with you.
MARTIN It's between her and Henrik ...
MARTIN She lost it when my father died.
MARTIN The drinking - her state of mind - it all got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her, leaving her alone in our old house on the other side of the island like she was excommunicated.
MARTIN She's never forgiven him.
And he seems as lost now as he must have been then.
MARTIN You have to stay and keep working.
MARTIN You're Henrik's last chance at some kind of resolution.
MARTIN Put this to rest for him one way of the other, and I'll try to keep my mother away.
MARTIN But, please, do it as quickly as you can.
BLOMKVIST I'll (try) -
They glance off to the sound of a motorcycle.
It appears, roars up, parks.
Salander climbs off it and shoulders a duffel bag.
Blomkvist seems surprised to see her.
BLOMKVIST Lisbeth, this is Martin Vanger.
MARTIN How do you do.
SALANDER Fine.
She comes past them without another word.
Martin can't help noticing her wasp and handcuff tattoos.
Looks after her as she disappears into the cottage.
It's hard to believe, but he has to ask:
MARTIN Girlfriend?
BLOMKVIST Assistant.
Blomkvist comes in as Martin drives off.
Salander is already unpacking her things - laptop, charger, change of clothes.
What's she doing, moving in?
BLOMKVIST Any trouble finding the place?
SALANDER Everyone in town knows who and where you are.
BLOMKVIST That's comforting.
BLOMKVIST Are you hungry?
BLOMKVIST Want a sandwich?
SALANDER No.
SALANDER Busy setting up her laptop on his desk, starting it up, sitting down at it, she's all but ignoring him.
BLOMKVIST I used to have a motorcycle.
BLOMKVIST When I was 19.
SALANDER I know.
SALANDER She hands him her own dog-eared Bible and a copy of the list of names and initials he gave her -
SALANDER The five cases from Harriet's list.
SALANDER And five more she missed - three I'm sure about.
SALANDER Five more?
SALANDER Blomkvist stares at her but she's turned back to her laptop, bringing up police reports and crime scene photos.
SALANDER Rebecka was the first, like you thought ...
SALANDER M.H., is Mari Holmberg - a prostitute in Kalmar - murdered in 1954.
SALANDER Leviticus verse 20, line
91. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
BLOMKVIST "If a man lies with a woman having her sickness, he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood."
Blomkvist doesn't see a connection.
SALANDER She was raped and stabbed, but the cause of death was suffocation with a sanitary napkin.
SALANDER R.L.
SALANDER Rakel Lunde,
Salander brings up more crime photos -
SALANDER Cleaning woman and part-time palm reader, tied up with a clothesline, gagged, raped, head crushed with a rock.
SALANDER Leviticus 20:27.
BLOMKVIST "A woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning."
She's lit a cigarette and brings up the next photos -
BLOMKVIST I only smoke outside.
SALANDER Sara Witt, 1964.
SALANDER Daughter of a pastor.
SALANDER Tied to her bed, raped, charred in the fire that burned down her house.
SALANDER Leviticus -
BLOMKVIST 21:9.
BLOMKVIST "The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father and shall be burned with (fire) -
SALANDER Magda Lovisa Sjoberg, 1960 -
Several photos of a dead woman and dead cow -
SALANDER Found in a barn, stabbed and raped with farm tools.
SALANDER A cow in the next stall with its throat slit, its blood splashed on her, hers on it.
BLOMKVIST Leviticus 20:16 - "If a woman lies with any beast, you shall kill the woman and the beast, their blood is upon (them) -
SALANDER Lea Persson, 1962 -
SALANDER A photo of a pretty girl in riding jodhpurs, petting a horse, and several more of her dead naked body on a wet cement floor surrounded by tropical fish.
SALANDER Found by her sister in their pet shop - raped, beaten.
SALANDER The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums.
SALANDER There was a parakeet inside her.
SALANDER Leviticus 26:21/22.
SALANDER Before Blomkvist can find the verse, she's on to the next ones.
SALANDER More photos of murdered girls -
SALANDER Eva Gustavsson, 1960.
SALANDER A runaway.
SALANDER Raped, strangled, a burnt pigeon tied around her neck.
SALANDER Lena Andersson, 1967, a student.
SALANDER Raped, stabbed, decapitated -
BLOMKVIST Okay -
SALANDER I'm not done -
BLOMKVIST It's all right, we're looking for a serial murderer ...
BLOMKVIST But what does it have to do with a 16-year-old girl on an island?
BLOMKVIST Salander, as we know, is not paid to give her opinion.
BLOMKVIST She's a hunter/gatherer, not an analyst.
BLOMKVIST But Blomkvist asked, so she gives it -
SALANDER She was looking for him, too.
The silence they just left has followed them out here.
The island, more than ever, feels haunted as Blomkvist looks off, smoking.
BLOMKVIST Rape.
BLOMKVIST Torture.
BLOMKVIST Fire.
BLOMKVIST Animals.
BLOMKVIST Religion.
BLOMKVIST Anything I'm missing?
SALANDER The names.
SALANDER They're all Biblical.
SALANDER The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary - Sara, Rakel - all from the Old Testament.
BLOMKVIST Which means they're Jewish names.
BLOMKVIST He glances off to Harald's dark house.
BLOMKVIST If there's one thing the Vangers have more than their share of, it's Nazis.
BLOMKVIST There's one of them.
BLOMKVIST The Nazi's shadowy form crosses behind the shades ...
He pokes at embers in the fireplace to try coax some flames.
BLOMKVIST I can see why Armansky values you so highly.
BLOMKVIST Your work is very good.
SALANDER It interests me.
SALANDER He takes a blanket from the back of a chair.
BLOMKVIST I'll take the couch.
BLOMKVIST You can have the bed.
SALANDER I can sleep on a couch.
BLOMKVIST So can I.
BLOMKVIST She takes the blanket from him and sits with it on the couch.
BLOMKVIST He watches her a moment.
BLOMKVIST Okay.
BLOMKVIST Good night.
SALANDER Night.
SALANDER She switches off the lamp.
SALANDER Then, in a moment, in the dark -
SALANDER Harriet's name isn't.
BLOMKVIST Isn't what.
SALANDER Jewish.
Salander browses through an iPhoto album of old photographs of Blomkvist and the motorcycle he mentioned.
In some of them, Erika is with him.
In all of them, he's wearing a leather jacket not unlike Salander's.
BLOMKVIST O/S What are you doing?
BLOMKVIST O/S He's just woken up in a tangle of blankets on the couch to see her at his laptop.
BLOMKVIST O/S She closes the album, leaving on the screen what she was looking at before: his iMovie of the parade and some annotated police files.
SALANDER Going over your notes.
BLOMKVIST They're encrypted.
BLOMKVIST She gives him a don't-be-a-child look.
SALANDER Have some coffee.
BLOMKVIST I will.
BLOMKVIST And then we'll have a talk about what's yours and what's mine.
BLOMKVIST Blomkvist drags himself up, pours himself some coffee, adds some milk.
95. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
SALANDER It's amazing what you figured out from the parade photos.
BLOMKVIST Thank you.
SALANDER Too bad you don't have hers.
BLOMKVIST Whose.
She doesn't say.
He comes over.
She plays the iMovie, stops on a frame before Harriet turns her head.
Points to a young couple standing among the people behind her.
The woman has an Instamatic camera in her hand.
SALANDER Her.
She advances to the next frame: The woman has raised the camera to her eye.
And the next: Harriet turning her head in foreground while in the background the flash cube atop the woman's Instamatic flares slightly.
Blomkvist is stunned, by both the fact he didn't notice it before, and what it means: Though the woman is taking a snapshot of the parade, she could have inadvertently included in it whatever - whoever - Harriet saw at that moment across the street.
BLOMKVIST Excuse me.
He takes over his laptop from her, finds the later Courier photos he didn't include in his iMovie, after Harriet has left.
In one, the couple is moving off the other way.
In another, they're getting in a parked car to leave.
He sharpens the Photoshop contrast.
The rear license plate is partly visible, but too small for him to make out even by squinting.
BLOMKVIST Can you read that?
SALANDER A, C, Three - the rest is blocked.
96. He focuses on a decal on the car's back window.
96. The letters are even small and blurrier, but she thinks she can make out -
SALANDER N, something, R, S, J -
BLOMKVIST Norsjo.
SALANDER Then something, K, something, R, I, F, something, I -
BLOMKVIST Carpentry.
BLOMKVIST Is that a phone number?
SALANDER Too small to read.
SALANDER He gets up.
SALANDER Heads for the front door to smoke his cigarette outside -
BLOMKVIST (ADR) I'm going to have to go to Norsjo.
BLOMKVIST (ADR) He opens the door to leave and sees on the porch - The charred corpse of the cat.
BLOMKVIST (ADR) Its legs - sawn off and arranged in the shape of a swastika - lie in the middle of a dark circle of blood.
BLOMKVIST (ADR) He seems too startled to move, but when Salander sees it, she immediately gets her camera and begins framing close-ups of the cat parts, and its head resting atop the seat of her motorcycle.
BLOMKVIST (ADR) Blomkvist stares off at Harald's house ...
As Frode scrolls through the photos of the dismembered cat on Salander's camera, horrified by them, she regards at a table across the room: Birger, Isabella and Gunner.
BLOMKVIST I wouldn't think Harald would sign his name like this, would you?
FRODE I can't say I know how he thinks.
FRODE He might.
BLOMKVIST Has anyone spoken to him about me since I've been here?
FRODE Maybe Isabella.
FRODE No one else.
BLOMKVIST Could she do something like this?
BLOMKVIST Frode glances off to her.
BLOMKVIST She's staring at Salander.
BLOMKVIST And turns to Birger.
ISABELLA Who's this creature now?
ISABELLA Frode takes one more look at the photos before -
FRODE I'm calling this off.
BLOMKVIST No.
BLOMKVIST You're authorizing me to rent a car.
Blomkvist and Salander coming down a corridor on their way out.
BLOMKVIST I'm sorry if that was uncomfortable.
SALANDER They don't bother me.
BLOMKVIST I'm sure they're not used to people who look like you.
SALANDER They don't like you either.
A car and a motorcycle split apart at an interchange - the Volvo to the north, Salander's Honda to the south.
Salander pulls her Honda into an underground garage.
No one says hello to her - nor she to them - as she strides through the place to the tech room.
INSERT: Cases snapped open revealing sophisticated surveillance equipment - several cameras, mounts, hand monitor, cables.
TECH CLERK I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky.
SALANDER So call him.
SALANDER The clerk picks up a phone, but then sets it back down.
SALANDER Picks up the list again.
TECH CLERK Next time, I'd prefer you fill out the proper paperwork.
A Volvo speeds along a rural highway, far from Hedestad and the Vangers.
On the passenger seat - INSERT: the car rental agreement - a print of the parade photo of the couple getting into the car he was looking at with Salander on his laptop - and a hand- written note that reads -
A POV through the windshield of a highway sign alerts him the Norsjo exit is coming up.
The main street of a very small town.
The Volvo pulls to a stop outside its only hardware store.
An ancient place with narrow aisles crammed with stuff.
CLERK 1 Can I help you?
99. The clerk - for what Blomkvist needs - is too young.
BLOMKVIST I'm waiting for the older gentleman, thanks.
BLOMKVIST He gestures to a clerk in his 60's helping a customer.
The older clerk looks at the parade photo of the couple.
BLOMKVIST The carpentry shop is gone.
BLOMKVIST I don't know if he worked there or not.
BLOMKVIST If he did, maybe he used to buy hardware here.
CLERK 2 I don't recognize him.
CLERK 2 Sorry.
BLOMKVIST I had to start somewhere.
BLOMKVIST Thanks.
BLOMKVIST As he gathers up the photos to leave -
CLERK 2 I'm no detective, but I think I would've started at the retirement home.
CLERK 2 Blomkvist looks up.
CLERK 2 Not a bad idea.
Salander checks a `mirror' of Bjurman's computer on her laptop.
Skims one of the monthly reports she instructed him to write.
A group of elderly men and women in a rec room pass Blomkvist's photos around.
One old man offers -
FORSMAN This is Brannlund's kid.
FORSMAN He was a contractor, the father.
BLOMKVIST Brannlund.
FORSMAN Assar.
100. Blomkvist writes the name down.
BLOMKVIST You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, the son?
FORSMAN Next to his father at the cemetery.
FORSMAN He was killed in an accident on a job site years ago.
FORSMAN But she might be alive -
FORSMAN His widow.
She is still alive, and sitting across from Blomkvist in her living room as he takes out his photos -
BLOMKVIST In 1966, you were in Hedestad with your husband.
BLOMKVIST He shows her one of the photos.
MILDRED Oh, my goodness, there we are.
MILDRED Who took this?
BLOMKVIST Photographer at the local paper.
BLOMKVIST She smiles at the picture; it brings back good memories.
BLOMKVIST You were taking pictures, too.
BLOMKVIST Which I'd very much like to see if by some miracle you still have them.
MILDRED It wouldn't be a miracle.
MILDRED We were on our honeymoon.
MILDRED But why?
MILDRED Blomkvist thinks about making something up.
MILDRED Decides not to.
MILDRED Indicates Harriet in the photo -
BLOMKVIST This girl was killed that day, soon after seeing something across the street that frightened her.
MILDRED How awful.
101. Blomkvist nods; Mildred takes a closer look at the photo.
MILDRED She does look terrified.
MILDRED Mildred gets up with purpose, goes into another room, returns with a photo album.
MILDRED Leafs past wedding photos, to honeymoon photos and stops on the only one she took of the parade.
MILDRED She hands the album to Blomkvist.
MILDRED The snapshot shows the float with the harem girls in foreground, and - in the background, across the street - several out of focus figures -
BLOMKVIST Would you mind if I made a copy of this?
Establish.
He gets in the elevator without really looking at the figure already in it.
BJURMAN Ground, please.
BJURMAN A finger presses it.
BJURMAN The doors close and the elevator starts down.
SALANDER How's your sex life?
SALANDER Bjurman, terrified, backs into a corner.
SALANDER She presses a button and the elevator jerks to a stop between floors.
SALANDER I didn't care much for your last report.
SALANDER It felt perfunctory, like your heart wasn't in it.
SALANDER Let's see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next month's.
BJURMAN I under(stand) -
SALANDER Don't speak.
SALANDER I don't want to hear your voice.
SALANDER Just nod.
SALANDER He nods.
SALANDER Start looking for a shrink you can bribe to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me.
SALANDER He nods.
SALANDER She gets the elevator going again and steps closer to him.
SALANDER He tries bowing his head like a dog being scolded.
SALANDER She lifts his chin like he did to her before he raped her.
SALANDER And stop visiting tattoo removal websites or I'll do it again - right here.
SALANDER She touches his forehead.
SALANDER He backs away.
SALANDER The doors open and she steps out, leaving him in there, looking too frightened to move.
SALANDER The doors close.
Having returned and scanned Mildred's snapshot into Photoshop, Blomkvist better defines on his laptop its background and the people in frame across the street from where Harriet was standing:
INSERT: Couples, kids, a clown.
INSERT: The watch repair shop clock that reads, 2:00.
INSERT: A figure standing slightly apart from the other people.
It's too blurry to make out his face or age, but he has light brown hair, dark slacks, and a dark blazer with some kind of patch on the pocket.
Salander blasts onto the highway headed north.
Blomkvist regards Isabella's two photos on the wall.
In one she's a stunning young woman.
In the other, the old wreck she's become.
He glances to her husband Gottfried's photo.
Where a second more current photo of him should go is a Courier article about his drowning in 1965.
That's when Isabella changed - and this is where it happened - in this old house out on the point.
He untacks the article -
The boathouse hasn't fared well.
Neither has the dock Blomkvist has to walk on to reach it.
He glances inside - no boat, just dark water slapping against the pilings - looks back to the shore at the long-uninhabited cabin.
No electricity but enough light spills through the open door for him to see the neglected, shadowy interior:
Beds with bare, or no, mattresses.
Sticks of furniture.
Old water-stained books strewn around.
Beer bottles and other debris left by intrepid Hedestad teenagers.
It's creepy, even if you weren't alone in it, knowing what you know.
He kneels to look at some of the books.
Mickey Spillane, a bird guidebook, something called The Evil Empire about the USSR, a children's book.
He opens this last one and sees "Harriet" scrawled in a very young child's hand.
Having climbed the cliff above the cabin, he finds himself at the highest point on the island.
Stops to rest at the ruins of a fort.
A piece of the stone wall next to his head suddenly erupts.
As fragments tear into his scalp, he hears the delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot -
He throws himself to the ground.
Crawls desperately around and behind the ruins.
Sees his shirt is bloody but can't feel a wound under it.
Touches his face and finds the blood is coming from his forehead.
He can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he could it would mean they were walking toward him, which would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank.
He has to get out of here before that happens.
Behind him - the rocky cliff he just climbed.
Ahead of him - a clearing leading to woods.
Really only one choice -
He runs for the trees.
Dives through a curtain of thicket and stinging nettles that tear at his arms and hands.
Crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his elbows and toes like an infantryman.
Safe for the moment, he figures, hidden in the woods, he looks at the sun low in the sky, and decides to wait.
Salander, returned from Stockholm, moves around the cottage - inside and out - installing the equipment she brought from Milton Security: Motion detectors - security cameras - software that bisects a PC screen into quadrants showing night-vision views of each corner of the cottage.
A figure appears on a quadrant of Salander's surveillance PC.
Comes past the motorcycle and nearly reaches the porch before she hears -
BLOMKVIST O/S It's me.
BLOMKVIST O/S She opens the door to see him covered in blood, pressing a torn piece of his shirt to his bleeding head - and almost gasps.
BLOMKVIST It's that bad?
She turns the bathtub's hot water tap -
BLOMKVIST Is it still bleeding?
BLOMKVIST It's still bleeding ...
BLOMKVIST why is it still bleeding ...
BLOMKVIST She pulls a length of dental floss from its case -
BLOMKVIST (ADR) Is that dental floss?
SALANDER Yes.
SALANDER Splits it in two thinner lengths with her chewed finger nails -
SALANDER Feeds one of the lengths of floss through the eye of a needle -
BLOMKVIST What is that -
BLOMKVIST Is that necessary?
SALANDER Yes.
BLOMKVIST We can't just tape it?
SALANDER No.
SALANDER She perches on the edge of the tub where he sits - still in his pants - half-submerged in tepid water - bottle of vodka in his hand.
BLOMKVIST Did you sterilize that?
SALANDER No.
BLOMKVIST You didn't?
BLOMKVIST She splashes some of the vodka on the needle.
BLOMKVIST Most of it goes in the water.
BLOMKVIST Hands the bottle back to him.
SALANDER Drink some more.
SALANDER He takes a swig from the vodka bottle.
SALANDER She reaches to his face with the needle and floss -
BLOMKVIST Careful, it's my eye.
SALANDER Don't move.
SALANDER It takes all he's got not to move, and even that isn't enough as she first sticks the needle through the flesh.
SALANDER He pulls away with a groan.
SALANDER She just looks at him.
SALANDER Waits for him to take another swig of vodka to steel himself.
SALANDER She pierces him a second time, draws the floss through the skin.
SALANDER And after that it doesn't seem to be so bad.
SALANDER As she works, his eyes glance to hers with a mixture of dread and gratitude, but hers are focused on the work.
SALANDER Hers then briefly glance to his, but now his are down.
He comes out of the bathroom in his soaking wet pants and collapses on the bed.
She works to pull his pants off.
BLOMKVIST What am I doing here ...
BLOMKVIST why did I ever come up here ...
BLOMKVIST He touches the wound and looks at his fingers -
BLOMKVIST It's too dark to see ...
BLOMKVIST did it stop bleeding ...
BLOMKVIST I think maybe it has ...
BLOMKVIST it still fucking hurts ...
She regards the surveillance monitor, the night-vision views of the cottage.
She can't believe it but she feels vigilant more for his sake than her own.
She goes to a window and looks out.
Sees her own reflection in the glass and studies it.
Then kicks her boots off.
She comes into the bedroom in her t-shirt and underwear.
He's still muttering without looking at her.
BLOMKVIST It wasn't an accident ...
BLOMKVIST Somebody was shooting at me ...
BLOMKVIST It's insane ...
BLOMKVIST these people are insane ...
SALANDER No one's shooting at you now.
SALANDER She pulls her t-shirt over his stitched-up head, cocooning it against her breasts.
SALANDER Silence.
SALANDER Then -
BLOMKVIST I'm pretty sure this isn't a good idea.
SALANDER Why.
SALANDER He extracts his head from the cocoon and looks at her.
BLOMKVIST Apart from the fact that I'm old, we work together.
SALANDER You work with what's-her-name.
SALANDER That's worked out for you.
SALANDER He nods.
SALANDER That's true.
SALANDER Then -
BLOMKVIST I have some standards of behavior, believe it or not.
SALANDER You need to stop talking.
SALANDER She climbs on top of him.
Afterwards.
She opens his dwindling pack of cigarettes.
Lights one.
Glances over to him lying next to her.
He's not looking at the smoke but rather the startling tattoos on her bare legs and arms.
Eventually -
SALANDER You want me to open a window?
SALANDER He shakes his head no.
SALANDER Reaches for the cigarette.
SALANDER Takes a drag.
SALANDER Hands it back.
He wakes.
Comes out to find a proper place setting on the table.
Sits with Salander.
Listens to that awkward, but not altogether unpleasant silence you always hear in this situation the next morning.
She breaks it -
SALANDER I like working with you.
BLOMKVIST I like working with you, too.
Establish.
Frode and Martin stare at Blomkvist's unprofessionally sutured head wound; Salander near him like an emaciated bodyguard.
FRODE People hunt on the island, Mikael.
FRODE Gunner's out there shooting something almost every day for his dinner.
FRODE It could have been a stray shot.
MARTIN Not from Gunner.
MARTIN If he wanted to shoot him, he'd have shot him.
FRODE We get poachers.
FRODE They're not always such great shots.
MARTIN Or he's right, Dirch.
MARTIN What if he is?
MARTIN This has to stop.
Frode regards Blomkvist.
FRODE Do you want to stop?
BLOMKVIST I have police reports, photos, Henrik's notes, my own notes, and Lisbeth's research.
BLOMKVIST What I don't have are Vanger Industries records.
BLOMKVIST That's what I want.
FRODE Why?
Blomkvist doesn't say.
Only -
BLOMKVIST Will you authorize it?
FRODE I could but why on earth would I?
BLOMKVIST Because I'm asking.
FRODE The private corporate records.
FRODE How far back?
BLOMKVIST All the way.
Frode exchanges a look with Martin.
BLOMKVIST Henrik said I have access to everything I need.
BLOMKVIST This is what I need.
FRODE That's not what he meant.
BLOMKVIST Let's ask him.
FRODE He's not well enough to ask.
BLOMKVIST I'd be happy to sign a nondisclosure statement, if that helps you.
FRODE Excuse us a moment.
FRODE Frode and Martin step away to confer in private.
MARTIN I think Henrik would say yes.
FRODE That's why he has me.
FRODE To protect him from himself.
FRODE This is insane.
MARTIN What do we have to hide?
FRODE Over the course of 120 years of doing business?
FRODE Plenty.
MARTIN If he needs this to do his job, he should have permission.
MARTIN This goes against every privileged, confidential bone in the lawyer's body.
MARTIN He can only stare at Blomkvist and Salander across the room, wondering why he hired either one of them.
Blomkvist and Salander walk down the road from Martin's house.
SALANDER What am I looking for?
BLOMKVIST Any connections between the company's holdings and the towns where the women were killed ...
BLOMKVIST and everything about Frode.
Vanger Industries' corporate archives are kept in the oldest building in the town's warehouse district.
The rumble of Salander's motorcycle announces her arrival.
Like someone visiting a relative they never liked, Blomkvist reviews yet again the photos from `that day' - scrolling through the bridge accident shots - He stops.
One of the figures has something in his hand he hadn't noticed before.
It and the figure are somewhat blurred in movement - but it looks like a gun.
He sharpens the contrast to reveal that the gun is in fact a Hasselblad-type camera.
Looks at the man's face - then at his wall of Vanger family photos - unhappy to see it matches Harald ...
Carbon-copied or original documents from the 50's and 60's surround Salander like the water around the island:
Financial analyses, annual reports, internal memoranda, trade union agreements, brittle news clippings, corporate staff photographs, one of which she's regarding now: A much younger Frode, posing against a wall of law books.
The photo of Harald in his Nazi uniform on the wall.
BLOMKVIST V/O Your father was taking pictures that day no one has seen.
Cecilia looks at the blurred bridge photo of Harald with the camera in his hand.
Then at Blomkvist, coolly.
BLOMKVIST I'd like to if I could.
CECILIA So ask him.
BLOMKVIST I was wondering if you could do that.
CECILIA I don't speak to him, as you know.
BLOMKVIST You couldn't make an exception in my case.
BLOMKVIST He gives her his most disarming smile.
BLOMKVIST It usually works with women, but doesn't seem to have much affect on her.
CECILIA Are you afraid to be in the same room with him?
CECILIA I'm not saying you shouldn't be.
BLOMKVIST You won't help me?
CECILIA Sorry.
Salander gets up and crosses to an anteroom where an unhappy older woman - the archive manager - seems to be doing nothing but waiting for the strange girl to leave.
LINDGREN Are you finished?
SALANDER No.
SALANDER I need to know where all the factories, offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966.
LINDGREN You already have everything.
SALANDER I don't.
SALANDER Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships, or suppliers.
LINDGREN Then you'll have to do without.
SALANDER Mr. Frode said I have access to whatever I need, and I need this.
LINDGREN He said you have access to this floor.
SALANDER Call him.
SALANDER The woman stares at her for a long moment, then picks up the phone.
Stairs lead them to a higher floor.
The woman climbs a step-stool.
Pulls a couple of large binders from a high shelf.
Salander doesn't help her off the stool and the woman looks at her even more unhappily than before.
The blinds, as usual, closed.
Couple of lamps throw shadows on the walls which display hunting and military trophies - wild game heads, sabers and vintage firearms - some of Harald's dearer photographs - some photographs in dusty frames.
Blomkvist, alone in the room, looks at them: Swedish Nazi leader in the 1930's.
HARALD Sven Olof Lindholm.
HARALD The 92-year-old comes into the room from the kitchen, followed by a housekeeper with a tea tray.
HARALD Indicates the younger man in the photo, also in a Nazi uniform, that Blomkvist is looking at.
HARALD Me.
HARALD Blomkvist nods.
HARALD Has no idea what to say.
HARALD But Harald waits for more of a response.
HARALD Finally -
BLOMKVIST Handsome.
HARALD Birger Furugard.
HARALD Me.
HARALD Per Engdahl.
HARALD Me.
HARALD Blomkvist's eyes shift to a bolt-action Mauser infantry rifle displayed on a shelf ...
HARALD But your interest is in my more candid photographic work.
Spread out on the desk: A map of Sweden showing the factory sites and other Vanger holdings - and one she made earlier where the nine women were murdered.
Dots appear at the same locations on both.
On a handwritten list of the victims, she puts a check next to Rebecka Jacobsson, 1949, Hedestad - moves on to Mari Holmberg, 1954, Kalmar - begins sifting through the mountain of Vanger Industries clippings from that year -
A bony Nazi pouring tea in a shadowy room with you is bad, but the rabbit-print tea cozy only makes it worse.
Blomkvist tries to ignore him settling back in his worn leather chair with his chipped cup, and sifts through an old shoebox of unsorted photographs:
A holiday at Lake Como, early 1950's judging from the cars; a Vanger family gathering long ago; some men posing by a slain wild boar dangling from a rope.
Harald holds out a pack of cigarettes.
Blomkvist comes over, pulls one out.
HARALD Blom ...
HARALD kvist ...
HARALD With an `o' - or a `u.'
BLOMKVIST `o.'
HARALD An `o.' Blom - kvist.
HARALD Harald doesn't say it, but his nod means, `not Jewish then.
HARALD Good' Blomkvist returns to the photos, glancing up occasionally to the smoke curling up past Harald's face as he examines the journalist at work.
HARALD I'm not a recluse.
HARALD I don't close my door to anyone.
HARALD They just don't visit.
BLOMKVIST Perhaps if you redecorated.
HARALD Hide the past like they do.
HARALD Under a thin, shiny veneer.
HARALD Like an Ikea table.
HARALD I'm the most honest of all of them.
BLOMKVIST The family.
HARALD Sweden.
HARALD Blomkvist opens another shoebox.
HARALD Lying on top is a photograph of the bridge accident, and, under it, a few more.
HARALD He takes them out and angles them toward a lamp.
HARALD Two point eight.
BLOMKVIST Pardon me?
HARALD The Zeiss Tessar on my Hasselblad.
HARALD Excellent lens.
HARALD Blomkvist tries to nod appreciatively, but the bridge photos don't tell him anything he doesn't already know.
HARALD He finds several more that appear to be a hunting expedition - men and blood hounds - but then sees Morell in one, more policemen, and a stricken Henrik in boots and raincoat, and realizes this is the search party.
HARALD Off to the side, a young man, head turned half away, wearing a dark blazer with a gold patch, which that 2.8 Zeiss lens makes clear is a prep school insignia.
HARALD A lion.
HARALD Landscape?
HARALD Some nice landscapes there.
BLOMKVIST No, it's - I can't tell who it is from this angle.
BLOMKVIST He takes the photo over to the Nazi who only has to
glance at it a moment to recognize his late nephew's son:
HARALD That's Gottfried's boy.
BLOMKVIST Martin?
BLOMKVIST Harald nods, hands it back, smokes.
BLOMKVIST It's not unusual Martin would have joined the search party - it would be unusual if he hadn't - it's his sister that's missing - but this blazer he's wearing troubles Blomkvist -
HARALD Handsome but useless young man, Martin.
HARALD Like his father.
The archive manager shoulders her purse, locks her anteroom, and approaches Salander.
LINDGREN We're closing.
SALANDER Nowhere near finished.
LINDGREN I'm not staying late.
SALANDER I am.
SALANDER And I need access to all the rooms, including any that are locked.
SALANDER Call Frode.
As Henrik naps and Martin clears his dinner tray, Frode listens to the caller on the room phone -
LINDGREN V/O She wants to look at everything.
LINDGREN V/O I don't like her and I don't trust her.
LINDGREN V/O There's something wrong with her.
FRODE Hang on a second -
FRODE I'm going to let you decide.
FRODE It's Ms. Lindgren again.
MARTIN Yes, Ingrid, what's the problem?
LINDGREN V/O This girl wants a set of keys now.
LINDGREN V/O To my room as well.
LINDGREN V/O It's outrageous.
MARTIN It's fine.
MARTIN Just tell her to make sure to leave the keys with security when she's done.
Having found nothing of interest in the 1954 files, Salander moves on to the 1957 killing of Rakel Lunde.
The older woman comes back.
Drops a set of keys on the desk.
LINDGREN Stay all night if you want.
LINDGREN Leave the keys with the guard.
LINDGREN The woman leaves.
LINDGREN Her footsteps echo and fade.
LINDGREN Salander
reads a yellowed clipping from a Landskrona newspaper:
116. It's about Vanger Industries hiring a local contractor, Carlen Construction, to build a plant.
116. Gottfried Vanger - here to sign the contract.
116. But all that really interests Salander is the date.
116. The article was published one day after the paper printed the story of the discovery of Rakel's battered naked body.
116. Salander flips through the handwritten notes she made during her talk with the retired detective in Landskrona - and finds that part-time palm reader Rakel's main job was as a cleaning woman for Carlen Construction.
116. The detective interviewed her co-workers, but no one from Vanger Industries, including that firm's representative in town for a few days, Gottfried Vanger.
116. Gottfried Vanger ...
116. which one was he again?
116. Salander brings up on her laptop photographs she took of the wall of the cottage: the Vanger family tree.
116. Gottfried Vanger, Son of Margareta & Richard the Nazi Husband of crazy Isabella, Father of Martin and Harriet
116. Of all the Vangers - at least back in 1950 when Harriet was born - Gottfried was the most handsome.
116. Clark Gable good looks.
116. She puts a check next to Rakel's name and returns to Mari Holmberg and the 1954 Vanger files.
Blomkvist flips through one of Morell's reports stating everyone's whereabouts on the day Harriet's disappeared.
INSERT: Across from Martin Vanger's name it reads: "Arrived on 4:30 train."
He brings up the Photoshop-enhanced Brannlund parade photo on his laptop -
INSERT: The figure with the blazer and pocket patch standing near the watch repair clock, which reads: 2:00.
And the photo Harald let him take with him of `Gottfried's useless boy' -
INSERT: Young Martin with the search party, the emblem clearly visible on his blazer pccket.
He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's victims' files.
Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson, 1967.
The photo is a school wallet photo -
117. INSERT: She's wearing a sweater with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin.
117. He looks at Mildred's parade photo of the figure standing near the watch repair clock.
117. It reads, 2:00.
117. And the photo Harald let him take with him of `Gottfried's useless boy' with the search party.
117. In it and the parade photo, he's wearing the same blazer.
117. He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's victims' files.
117. Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson, 1967.
117. The photo is a school wallet photo - in a sweater with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin.
Knowing what she's looking for now, Salander finds it fairly quickly: A clipping about a timber company Vanger Industries bought in Kalmar and an interview in its local paper with Gottfried, two days after Mari's murder.
She jumps to 1960 - Magda Lovisa Sjoberg - Karlstad - and an article in its local paper - this time with a photo of Gottfried - about a union dispute at its factory there.
Blomkvist comes out with his cell phone, tries to make a bar or two materialize on it.
Dials but only gets a beep that asks him if he wants to `retry.' He doesn't.
Instead, under the darkening sky, he looks off to the point.
Martin's house is small in the distance, but he can see there's no car in the driveway and no lights on.
He stares at it for a long time ...
Salander pulls a 1962 Uddevalla paper from the files.
Same day this time, the same page of the newspaper: Lea Persson's horrific murder and an story quoting Gottfried about an expansion project to the town's harbor.
She regards Gottfried's newsprint photo: His face looks more than 8 years older than the one in Kalmar but that's what drinking to excess, and murder perhaps, does to you.
Blomkvist lays the Lena Andersson article - and the photograph of the figure at the parade - atop the rest of the junk on the desk - and quickly scrolls through photos on his laptop, leaving on the screen for Salander to see when she returns: Martin's recent Vanger Industries PR portrait ...
Salander has hit a snag.
Gets up.
We stay to have a look at the problem she leaves: the victims list - now with "Gottfried" jotted down next to all but one name: 1967 - Lena Andersson - Uppsala
Next to it, the newspaper article about the murdered girl, with a school photo.
And, next to that, the reason there's no "Gottfried" notation: his obituary in a Hedestad Courier clipping: 1965.
We listen to the fading echo of Salander's footsteps -
As annoying as the older woman was, it was less creepy with her around.
Salander is alone in the old building now, wandering through it looking for vending machines.
She finds some.
Drops coins in one.
A cup fills with coffee.
She gets a candy bar from another.
The coffee machine finishes.
The place again plunges into silence.
She starts back with her snack down a hallway -
Trying to look like he's just out for a stroll, Blomkvist walks past Martin's dark house, then turns around, walks up the front path to the porch and makes a show of knocking on the door, just in case anyone on the island can see him, which is doubtful in this darkness.
He tries the door.
Locked.
Comes down off the porch as if leaving, but then veers off the path and walks around to the side of the house.
He peers through a floor-to-ceiling window, but can't see much inside.
Comes around to the back and looks in another window.
Tries the back door.
Unlocked.
He can't see a lot in the dark, but doesn't dare switch on any lights.
He crosses through the kitchen, but we stay behind to regard a closed basement door ...
We pick him up again as he comes into the living room, follow him to a wall of glass.
It's pitch black outside.
We follow him down a hallway - but stop at a bedroom doorway as if this is as far as we care to go.
We stay at the threshold and watch him go in and look around.
As he begins rummaging around the recesses of a closet -
A pair of headlights comes across the bridge.
Blomkvist comes back to the wall of glass.
Still no lights out there.
Heads off to the hall again.
The car parks fifty yards from Blomkvist's cottage.
The headlights blink off.
Someone climbs out.
Blomkvist comes into a study.
Lots of books and framed photographs.
He begins looking around.
The headlights come up the road leading to the point.
Blomkvist approaches a gun case in the study.
Hunting rifles.
Three of them - and an empty space for a fourth one.
The trees outside the study window flare with light.
A moment later, Blomkvist hears a sound of tires on gravel.
Martin is back, and Blomkvist is in his house.
We rush back down the hall with Blomkvist.
Hopefully Martin will enter through the front door because we're going to try to get out the back one -
Blomkvist trips over something in the dark and we go down with him.
Then up again - through the kitchen - past the basement door - grabs a knife from a drawer - shoves it in a back pocket - hurries out the rear door -
Blomkvist tries to steady his breathing as he slinks around the side of the house.
As he passes a window, it lights up - and we again hit the ground with him.
He hurries across the yard, trips over something in the dark - a sprinkler?
- and goes down again into wet muck.
He gets up and starts down the road as if returning from a leisurely evening walk - which would be more convincing without the limp - not daring to look back as he goes.
MARTIN O/S Hello?
MARTIN O/S Mikael?
MARTIN O/S Blomkvist stops.
MARTIN O/S His heart pounds.
MARTIN O/S Martin comes down his porch and walks toward his car.
MARTIN Your evening stroll?
BLOMKVIST Hi.
BLOMKVIST How are you?
BLOMKVIST Martin pulls a golf bag from his trunk and shoulders it.
MARTIN I stopped at the hospital on my way home.
MARTIN Henrik asked me to ask you something.
BLOMKVIST What.
MARTIN Come on in, I'll make you a drink.
MARTIN Naturally, this is the last thing Blomkvist wants to do, but it would be more suspicious if he refuses.
MARTIN He heads back to Martin's house, trying not to limp.
Finished with her candy bar and coffee, Salander opens the 1967 files, looks through the clippings for anything of note in Uppsala, where Lena was killed.
She finds no news of factories opening there that year, but she does come across a PR newsletter about a winter retreat for fifty employees and their families.
There's a photo of Henrik presenting someone with a Best Worker of the Year plaque.
And another taken at a dinner for twenty guests and Vanger family members: The camera has captured Henrik presiding at the head of the table, putting on a brave face, raising a champagne flute - as everyone else does the same - except for the young man at the far right foreground.
He looks sullen.
But what teenager wouldn't at an event as boring as this.
Salander would look even more sullen.
She checks the caption and reads:
...
far right, Martin Vanger (19), currently studying in Uppsala.
121. Uppsala.
121. Same place as Lena - though it's what young Martin is wearing that strikes her: an Uppsala private school blazer with a lion on its pocket - the same as on Lena Andersson's sweater in the photo of her in the article about her murder.
It's not as eerie with the lights on - except for the fact there's a killer in it.
Martin sets the golf clubs down and begins emptying a grocery bag in the kitchen.
MARTIN What happened to you?
BLOMKVIST When.
MARTIN Now.
MARTIN Blomkvist's clothes.
MARTIN The fresh mud stains.
BLOMKVIST I fell in the dark.
MARTIN You don't have a flashlight?
MARTIN I'll give you one.
BLOMKVIST I just wasn't being careful.
BLOMKVIST Martin smiles, but Blomkvist isn't sure what he said warrants one.
BLOMKVIST Martin begins rummaging through a drawer for a flashlight.
BLOMKVIST The knife block - with one missing - is right there.
MARTIN How's the investigation?
BLOMKVIST Nothing new to report.
BLOMKVIST Blomkvist notices a drop of blood from his pantleg on the stone floor and covers it up with his shoe.
BLOMKVIST Martin, not seeming to notice, finds a mini-Maglite in the drawer.
MARTIN Dirch says Ms. Salander is clever.
MARTIN Maybe she'll turn something up.
BLOMKVIST Maybe.
122. Martin hands Blomkvist the mini-Maglite.
BLOMKVIST Thanks.
Salander scrolls through laptop photos to the one at the parade taken by the Brannlund woman on her honeymoon; the people across the street and the blurry figure wearing the blazer with the "pocket square" ...
SALANDER Hello, Martin.
Martin pours Scotch.
Hands one to Blomkvist.
BLOMKVIST What did he say?
MARTIN What?
BLOMKVIST You said Henrik asked you to ask me something.
MARTIN I just did.
BLOMKVIST What?
MARTIN How the investigation's going.
MARTIN That was his question.
BLOMKVIST Oh.
BLOMKVIST Blomkvist's eyes only dart to a rifle bag leaning against the wall next to a box of shells, but Martin follows them.
MARTIN You hunt?
MARTIN We should go hunting together sometime.
BLOMKVIST Sure.
BLOMKVIST They drink.
BLOMKVIST Listen to a silence.
MARTIN Nothing at all?
MARTIN New.
MARTIN To report.
BLOMKVIST No.
Martin regards Blomkvist in another silence.
Then -
MARTIN I can see you're anxious.
BLOMKVIST No.
MARTIN To get home.
MARTIN After your walk.
BLOMKVIST I suppose I am.
MARTIN To have dinner.
MARTIN With your girlfriend.
BLOMKVIST My assistant.
BLOMKVIST Yes.
MARTIN We'll have better luck with a gun.
BLOMKVIST Sorry?
MARTIN When we go hunting.
Martin pulls open a bar drawer and takes from it a handgun.
MARTIN A gun.
MARTIN Rather than a knife.
He gives a little gesture with it to the handle of the knife protruding from a back pocket of Blomkvist's jeans.
There are fresh drops of blood on the floor next to his shoes.
MARTIN You just couldn't stay away, could you.
Blomkvist doesn't know what to say.
Martin's demeanor, even in this situation, remains cordial.
MARTIN I want to show you something.
MARTIN Bring your drink.
MARTIN Leave the knife.
MARTIN Blomkvist's hope of getting out of here unscathed is pretty much gone now.
MARTIN He pulls the knife from his back pocket and sets it on a side table.
Salander strides past the napping night watchman without leaving the keys or bothering to tell him she's done.
Crossing the empty parking lot, she tries Blomkvist on her cell.
Gets his voice mail.
Kick-starts her bike.
Martin "leads" Blomkvist from behind back to the kitchen, switching off lights as they go.
MARTIN You know what's harder than shooting someone?
MARTIN Just missing them.
MARTIN That was a very good shot up at the cabin.
BLOMKVIST It didn't work.
BLOMKVIST I'm here.
MARTIN Mikael, it did work.
MARTIN You're here.
MARTIN They come through a pantry, at the end of which is a door.
MARTIN Open it.
MARTIN Blomkvist does.
MARTIN Sees steps leading into darkness.
MARTIN As they descend Martin flicks a switch and bare fluorescent tubes flicker on to reveal: A furnace.
MARTIN Washer.
MARTIN Dryer.
MARTIN Old discarded furniture.
MARTIN And another door.
MARTIN A steel one.
MARTIN As they approach it, Martin presses a little remote and the lock on the steel door clicks.
MARTIN Push it open.
As Blomkvist steps across the threshold -
MARTIN Switch is on the left.
MARTIN Blomkvist flips it and a row of overhead fluorescent tubes flickers on - one after the other - revealing a
subterranean torture chamber:
Metal eyelets bolted to the concrete walls and ceiling and floor - table with leather straps - bed with leather straps - steel-mesh cage - work bench with handsaws and other tools -
Blomkvist takes it in with one glance and immediately turns to try to smash the glass in his hand into Martin's face - which is covered now with a plastic oxygen mask he holds to it.
Gas plumes down on Blomkvist from above; the glass comes out of his hand, shattering on the cement floor -
The Honda's single headlight shudders as Salander comes across the bridge onto the island.
Blomkvist comes to on the floor, handcuffed to a chain that runs through a metal eyelet.
He sees Martin behind a video camera on a tripod, focusing it - a shelf full of Betamax tapes - and a TV monitor on which his own image then appears.
Note: the steel door if we were close enough to it to notice - which we aren't - is not locked.
It's not even completely shut.
Satisfied with the framing of the shot of his guest, Martin takes a seat on a comfortable armchair upholstered in clear plastic.
It squeaks.
He regards Blomkvist calmly.
Sips his drink.
Then almost sighs.
MARTIN Why didn't you just go home.
BLOMKVIST I assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed.
BLOMKVIST Martin smiles, appreciating, perhaps, Blomkvist's "easy" manner in this dire circumstance.
MARTIN How'd you do it?
MARTIN What did you find?
126. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
Blomkvist doesn't say.
Martin looks like he has all the time in the world to wait, and does.
Then -
MARTIN We can talk or we can just get on with it.
MARTIN It's really up to you.
Nothing from Blomkvist.
Martin shrugs `okay,' gets up, goes to his workbench and takes a plastic shower curtain from it.
As he's laying it on the floor around his victim, Blomkvist changes his mind -
BLOMKVIST I found a picture no one had seen before.
MARTIN Of.
BLOMKVIST You.
BLOMKVIST In your Uppsala prep school blazer.
Martin doesn't see the significance, but is pleased Blomkvist has decided to "participate."
He rewards him by suspending his shower curtain work to return to the chair.
It squeaks again.
MARTIN What does that say?
BLOMKVIST That you lied about where you were that day.
BLOMKVIST Or rather when.
MARTIN Did I?
MARTIN If I did, so what.
MARTIN People lie all the time.
BLOMKVIST It also said that Lena Andersson was a schoolmate.
MARTIN Lena ...
MARTIN Lena was a long time ago.
MARTIN Where's this picture now?
MARTIN With all the other junk on your desk?
BLOMKVIST A print is.
BLOMKVIST Digital copies are on a secure photo site.
MARTIN That's a lie ...
MARTIN How much does the girl know?
MARTIN Blomkvist isn't sure how to play that question ...
MARTIN Let's hope it's as much as you.
MARTIN That'll make it more fun.
MARTIN Where is she?
BLOMKVIST Stockholm.
BLOMKVIST She went there this morning.
MARTIN And that's a lie.
MARTIN She's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap.
MARTIN Our archives manager called me - very perturbed with this girl.
MARTIN Lisbeth.
MARTIN I like that name.
MARTIN Lisbeth.
MARTIN When Lisbeth leaves I'll get a call from security, so I can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives - He holds up the keys he took from Blomkvist's pocket when he was out cold.
MARTIN I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me.
As Salander gets the door open with her key and comes in -
SALANDER Mikael - ?
SALANDER He's clearly not here.
SALANDER She goes to the closet.
SALANDER Takes out the surveillance PC.
SALANDER Puts it on the desk - next to Blomkvist's laptop which is now displaying - not the photo of Martin he left for her - but the Apple default "light spider" screen saver.
SALANDER As Salander begins rewinding the captured surveillance images backwards at high speed to get to earlier in the day -
Martin reframes the video camera to include part of himself in the shot, sits again and crosses his leg like this is a talk show.
128. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
MARTIN So what would you like to know?
There are so many things, but also no point, so Blomkvist says nothing.
MARTIN You're the journalist, ask me something.
Nothing from Blomkvist.
Which is okay with Martin; he can do this alone -
MARTIN What do I do with my guests?
MARTIN Is that the question?
MARTIN Well, before - I do what we're doing.
MARTIN Relax, have a drink, converse.
MARTIN I like that part a lot - having a chat when you both know one of you is going to die.
MARTIN After - I simply get rid of them.
MARTIN Out to sea -
MARTIN - unlike my father leaving them scattered all over the place like trophies.
MARTIN That's not smart if you ask me.
MARTIN That's just garish and loud.
MARTIN But he was a garish and loud man.
MARTIN Frankly, he got what he deserved.
Nothing from Blomkvist, but he is wondering now what happened to Gottfried if the drowning wasn't accidental.
MARTIN You can't be a sloppy technician like that.
MARTIN You can't drink to excess like he did.
MARTIN This takes discipline.
MARTIN It's a science of a thousand details.
MARTIN The planning.
MARTIN The execution.
MARTIN The cleanup.
MARTIN I'm sure I don't have to tell you you're going to make quite a mess.
Nothing from Blomkvist, but Martin nods.
("How do you do this and still function in normal society?")
MARTIN That's the interesting thing.
MARTIN Because most of the time I am just like everyone else.
MARTIN I just have a bigger secret.
MARTIN It's wonderful really - standing there waiting for a train - or on a street corner as people brush past me.
MARTIN You know what I mean;
129. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
MARTIN (CONT'D) you have secrets.
MARTIN (CONT'D) You had one when you came up here.
MARTIN (CONT'D) It made you feel - special.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Didn't it?
Blomkvist doesn't say.
Martin is a little thrown by Blomkvist's next unspoken comment -
MARTIN No.
MARTIN I'm not a rapist.
MARTIN Of course I do that too - and at one time it was enough - but - (gathers his thoughts to explain it) A rapist, Mikael, gets off on domination.
MARTIN I need ...
MARTIN - destruction.
Martin gets up and sets about the business of immobilizing Blomkvist further with a block-and-tackle contraption of chains and straps.
MARTIN Can I ask you something?
MARTIN Why don't people trust their instincts?
MARTIN They sense something's wrong - someone's walking too close behind them - yet they don't cross the street.
MARTIN You knew something was wrong - you even knew what it was - but you came back into the house.
MARTIN Did I force you?
MARTIN Did I grab you and drag you in?
MARTIN I just offered you a drink.
MARTIN You'd never think the fear of offending could be stronger than the fear of pain - but you know what?
MARTIN It is.
MARTIN They always come willingly.
It amazes him.
It always amazes him.
He keeps working.
MARTIN And then they're here.
MARTIN They know it's over like you do - and still somehow think they have a chance.
MARTIN "Maybe if I say the right thing - if I'm polite - or I cry and beg - maybe I'll survive."
MARTIN And then the moment comes when they realize ...
MARTIN no, all hope is gone.
MARTIN (CONT'D) And when that happens - when I see the hope draining from their face like it is from yours right now - (whispers like it's just between them) - well, I feel myself getting hard just watching it.
MARTIN (CONT'D) Silence ...
MARTIN Say something.
BLOMKVIST You are a sick fuck.
MARTIN ...
MARTIN Is this an interview or an editorial?
MARTIN Blomkvist, of course, doesn't answer, or comment, yet Martin considers what the journalist hasn't said ...
MARTIN You're right, this behavior is unacceptable.
MARTIN I know that.
MARTIN But we're not completely different.
MARTIN We both have desires.
MARTIN Satisfying mine just requires more towels.
MARTIN Martin regards Blomkvist in a silence.
MARTIN Then -
MARTIN Anything else you want to know?
MARTIN You sure?
MARTIN All right.
MARTIN Whatever you say.
MARTIN He yanks a chain that feeds through the pulleys that lift Blomkvist up onto his feet -
Salander watches the surveillance images, forward -
Blomkvist leaving the cottage and property on foot.
Blomkvist returning to the cottage, going back inside.
Blomkvist coming out and attempting a call on his cell.
Blomkvist going back inside the cottage.
Blomkvist coming out again and leaving the property.
Blomkvist not coming back.
Nothing but the sky darkening to night.
Then -
131. Headlights coming through frame.
131. A figure appearing on foot at the front gate.
131. The figure just standing there, looking at the cottage.
131. The figure approaching it, and, as it's trying the locked front door, the motion detection light snapping on and illuminating Martin.
131. Martin moving to the side, looking in a kitchen window, coming around front again, walking to the gate, turning around, looking back, then walking out of frame.
Blomkvist hangs from the block-and-tackle rig, leather strap around his neck now, fed through a ceiling eyelet.
With a big sewing scissors, Martin cuts through and removes Blomkvist's pants and underwear -
MARTIN It might amuse you to know that while you were over here having dinner with me and Liv - who, by the way, finds me very conventional - Irina was down here in the cage.
MARTIN Who's Irina, you ask?
MARTIN A girl I met in Belarus.
MARTIN Just another girl.
MARTIN Another immigrant whore.
MARTIN Who misses them?
MARTIN He returns to his work bench to lay out various tools next to his gun and a desk phone.
BLOMKVIST Your sister wasn't just another girl.
BLOMKVIST Martin comes back quickly and yanks a strap that cinches the noose tighter around Blomkvist's neck as it lifts him onto his tiptoes.
MARTIN What happened to her.
BLOMKVIST You're choking me -
MARTIN You found her?
BLOMKVIST You killed her.
BLOMKVIST Martin just stares at him confused.
BLOMKVIST Then -
MARTIN You useless fuckin detective.
He lets go of the strap and Blomkvist's feet come back down to the floor.
As Martin returns to his workbench, Blomkvist is not only scared to death, but confused now.
Did Martin not kill her?
Then Martin is back in front of him with a roll of cellophane, pulls on the strap again until Blomkvist is balancing on his tiptoes, and ties it off.
MARTIN Too tight to talk?
It is.
Blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag.
MARTIN Good.
MARTIN I'm tired of talking to you.
He wraps Blomkvist's head in cellophane, completely cutting off his ability to breathe, and calmly watches him struggle.
...
MARTIN Would you like me to do something about that?
Blomkvist desperately nods as he's about to suffocate.
Martin watches another several moments ...
then pokes a finger through the cellophane into Blomkvist's gasping mouth.
MARTIN See?
MARTIN I'm not a monster.
He frames a wide shot of his naked prey.
Turns on some music.
Takes a moment to collect himself from all this strenuous work.
Brushes back his hair like he wants to look presentable in the shot.
Then smiles pleasantly -
MARTIN You know, I've never had a man in here.
MARTIN I've never touched a man as a matter of fact.
MARTIN Except my father, of course.
MARTIN But that was my duty.
MARTIN Harriet's, too.
The circulation to Blomkvist's head is being cut off by the strap.
His fingers behind his naked back claw at the concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the noose, but can't get a grip.
Martin watches the struggle calmly, and just as calmly offers:
MARTIN It's time.
MARTIN I don't want to be late for my date with our girlfriend.
133. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
He puts on a plastic rain poncho.
A painter's mask.
Plastic goggles.
Surgeons gloves.
Picks up a hunting knife.
Steps up to Blomkvist.
Looks at his eyes.
Brings his own head close to his victim's -
MARTIN Goodbye, Mikael.
He pulls the strap, lifting Blomkvist's toes off the floor, closing off his air again ...
and is about to gut him like a wild boar ...
when he hears a sound like some kind of animal behind him ...
He turns and sees her - coming at him from out of the shadows by the steel door - He darts for the gun he left on the workbench - Salander just as quickly swings a 5-iron - his 5-iron - like a baseball bat.
Its metal-wedged end arcs through the gloom and slams into the side of his head, sending him tumbling to the floor.
He struggles up to his knees, and she swings the club again, splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples the floor.
She takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her other back pocket.
Grabs the hunting knife and shackles key and hurries over to Blomkvist who only witnessed part of the spectacle before losing consciousness -
She saws through the leather strap around his neck.
Unlocks the chain.
As he sinks to his knees on the floor, blood rushes to his head, bringing him back to life just enough to see what she can't behind her -
Martin, blood streaming from the gash in his head, getting to his feet.
But he's not coming at them; he's trying to get out -
Blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look.
Lifts a hand to try to point.
She turns and glimpses the monster as he disappears out the steel door.
Looks back at Blomkvist, still handcuffed on the floor, and, like a child asking a parent for permission -
SALANDER May I kill him?
Nothing in his life would allow him to agree to such a thing - until now.
Now it's as if her years of violence and degradation have been passed to him.
He nods.
134. She puts the hunting knife in his hand.
134. Pulls the gun from her back pocket, checks the clip, flicks off the safety, and turns to leave -
BLOMKVIST He has more guns in the den -
SALANDER I know.
SALANDER She comes up the basement stairs, leading with her gun.
SALANDER Distant thunder rumbles.
SALANDER She crosses through the kitchen to the living room, and down the hall to the study.
SALANDER She eases around the doorway - the room is empty - looks to the gun case - sees there are only two rifles there now.
SALANDER She hears an engine start outside.
SALANDER Hurries back through the house.
SALANDER Sees out the picture window the taillights of Martin's car receding fast down the road as clouds burst.
SALANDER She bangs out the front door.
SALANDER Runs halfway down the hill in the rain to where she left her motorcycle, jumps on and kick-starts it.
She roars onto the bridge, chasing the taillights.
Guns the bike to full throttle.
Comes alongside him.
He swerves to try to crush her against the railing - but she hits the brakes, avoiding the impact -
She accelerates again and comes up on the other side of the car.
He swerves again at her, but this time the bike pulls ahead of him.
Now he's chasing her -
He gains on her as they near the end of the bridge.
As they race off it, he goes in for the kill, but she veers hard to one side, leaving him headed straight for the gas station Blomkvist makes his pay phone calls from - and the tanker truck parked there -
Martin hits the brakes - hydroplanes into the truck - and its, or his own tank, or both, explode - Salander circles back.
Regards the fire engulfing the car.
The rain does nothing to dampen it.
She could probably brave it to pull Martin out - but doesn't.
As the flames burn his clothes, he manages to get his hands on the rifle he took from the den, turns its barrel to his bloody head - but before he can pull the trigger, she hurries over, yanks it from his grasp and stands back again.
It's much more cathartic to watch him burn ...
She finds Blomkvist in the living room.
Sitting in a chair, his coat wrapped around him.
The hunting knife in his hand.
Distant sirens echo.
He can still just barely manage to speak -
BLOMKVIST Where is he?
SALANDER Dead.
Reminiscent of the last photographs taken on the Hedeby Island bridge forty years ago, police and firemen finish up at the crash site.
A winch drags Martin's charred black wreck of a car onto a tow truck.
Blomkvist is asleep in the bedroom with what looks like a neck tattoo - the black and blue mark left by Martin's noose that nearly strangled him to death.
He doesn't hear the knock at the front door, nor -
SALANDER O/S It's open.
SALANDER O/S Frode comes into the cottage looking shaken.
SALANDER O/S Salander is the picture of calm, drinking a cup of black coffee.
FRODE Where's Mikael?
SALANDER Asleep.
SALANDER Coffee?
SALANDER There's no milk.
SALANDER Frode absently shakes his head no.
FRODE I have some very upsetting news.
FRODE Martin was killed in a car accident last night.
SALANDER Sad.
SALANDER Frode isn't sure he heard right.
SALANDER Regards Salander sipping her coffee.
FRODE What?
SALANDER I said it's sad.
FRODE What do you know about this?
FRODE She doesn't say any more.
FRODE Frode gets up and starts toward the bedroom -
FRODE I have to talk to (Mikael) -
SALANDER Let him sleep.
SALANDER It's not a request; it's a command.
Frode is ashen as he leafs through a binder Salander brought from Martin's chamber of horrors late last night:
A scrapbook of murder.
A death book.
Photos of women cowering in his cage, tied to the bed, dead on the table - along with souvenirs of painted fingernails and locks of hair - all carefully taped into the `album.' The older photographs are Polaroids; the newer ones digital prints.
With little to no discernible emotion, Salander watches Frode wince as he turns the pages.
Frode can't take it anymore.
Closes the book before reaching the end.
Just sits there.
FRODE What are we going to do?
SALANDER We're going home, Mikael and me.
SALANDER I don't know what you're going to do.
FRODE I'm going to the police.
SALANDER Show them the videos while you're at it.
FRODE The - Salander points to a stack of video tapes.
SALANDER Would you like to see them?
FRODE No.
Blomkvist half-wakes to find Salander lying next to him, fully-clothed, watching him.
Is she actually there, or part of a dream?
He looks at her a long moment, then tries out his voice -
BLOMKVIST How is it someone who's 23 is a ward of the state?
SALANDER I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life.
SALANDER He smiles, thinking it's joke.
SALANDER It isn't, he realizes.
BLOMKVIST Since when have they said that.
SALANDER Since I was twelve.
BLOMKVIST Something happened when you were twelve?
BLOMKVIST She doesn't say.
BLOMKVIST Just studies him ...
BLOMKVIST It's all right, you don't have to tell me anything -
SALANDER I tried to kill my father.
SALANDER I burned him alive.
SALANDER Got about 80 percent of him.
BLOMKVIST Oh.
BLOMKVIST Silence.
BLOMKVIST Then -
SALANDER We need milk.
She pours milk in her coffee from the carton she just bought.
Pushes over two faded Polaroid photos.
He picks them up: One shows a young girl about 14, naked from the waist up, head turned half-away from the camera.
The second shows her on her stomach on a bed, completely naked, face turned to the photographer, frightened.
BLOMKVIST Harriet?
SALANDER I think so.
SALANDER Blomkvist can't look at the photos long.
SALANDER Sets them down.
SALANDER Something's troubling him -
BLOMKVIST Martin didn't deny killing anyone.
BLOMKVIST But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused.
BLOMKVIST He was angry - at me - for not being able to tell him what happened to her.
BLOMKVIST He didn't kill her.
BLOMKVIST And his father was dead the year before.
BLOMKVIST What if she did somehow get away?
BLOMKVIST Could she have done that?
BLOMKVIST Could she have done it alone?
BLOMKVIST He goes up to his wall of suspects.
BLOMKVIST Is she's alive, there's only one person in this family who would know where she is.
BLOMKVIST He takes the photo of Anita down from the wall.
Henrik sits in one of the chairs.
Blomkvist in another.
Salander prefers to stand.
Eventually -
VANGER Poor Martin.
VANGER Clearly, he hasn't been shown the death book, or been told the tale of Blomkvist's night in Martin's dungeon.
BLOMKVIST I have to go away for a couple days.
BLOMKVIST When I come back, I hope to have an answer for you.
BLOMKVIST Such a possibility stuns the old man.
BLOMKVIST He regards Blomkvist a moment.
BLOMKVIST Then Salander ...
VANGER Would the young lady mind giving us a moment of privacy.
BLOMKVIST She's my partner, Henrik.
BLOMKVIST She should stay.
BLOMKVIST A tiny, tiny, tiny smile finds its way to her face at the mention of the word `partner.'
VANGER What have you found?
BLOMKVIST I'm not sure.
VANGER Don't treat me like a child.
VANGER Tell me.
BLOMKVIST I can't.
BLOMKVIST I don't know.
BLOMKVIST I need a week.
BLOMKVIST Vanger studies him.
BLOMKVIST Then -
VANGER I've waited forty years.
VANGER I can wait another week.
Blomkvist and Salander read magazines in a pair of coach seats.
Across the aisle - occupying two seats - is one 300-lb.
sleeping figure: Plague.
They drink pints in an unpopular, almost-empty pub.
A Cure song plays.
BLOMKVIST I always liked this song.
BLOMKVIST You don't?
SALANDER I don't like classical music.
SALANDER A strange-looking young man comes in, regards the strange- looking trio at the table, comes over.
SALANDER To the fat man -
TRINITY Plague?
PLAGUE Trinity.
SALANDER Wasp.
SALANDER Blomkvist starts to offer his hand before realizing no one else has or will.
BLOMKVIST ...
BLOMKVIST Mikael.
BLOMKVIST Trinity sits.
BLOMKVIST None of these people have much experience with human interaction.
BLOMKVIST They all look at Blomkvist, but he isn't sure why.
SALANDER The money.
SALANDER Blomkvist takes an envelope from his jacket, hands it to Trinity.
SALANDER He begins counting it -
Alone in the back of a parked van amidst electronic components he doesn't understand, Blomkvist anxiously stares out a tinted window at a dark row house.
Headlights flare down the street.
An approaching car.
He hopes it passes, but it instead pulls up to the garage - waits for the door to go up - pulls in.
BLOMKVIST Fuck me.
BLOMKVIST He watches Anita Vanger get out of the car - the garage door come down - light go on inside the house - then dark figures hurrying along the side of the house: Trinity, Salander, and finally Plague.
BLOMKVIST They climb into the van with their tools, firewires, a laptop.
BLOMKVIST None speaks as they tether cables to computers in the van.
BLOMKVIST Blomkvist just watches.
BLOMKVIST Finally, to him -
SALANDER It's your turn.
Blomkvist knocks on the door.
Anita pulls it open.
BLOMKVIST It's me.
BLOMKVIST Sorry to bother you.
BLOMKVIST She doesn't invite him in, but doesn't shut the door in his face either.
ANITA What do you want?
BLOMKVIST No one's called you?
ANITA About.
BLOMKVIST Your cousin.
BLOMKVIST She has two, but doesn't ask which -
BLOMKVIST Martin.
ANITA What about him?
BLOMKVIST He died last Thursday.
BLOMKVIST A car accident.
BLOMKVIST I'm sorry.
BLOMKVIST There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad.
BLOMKVIST I know you haven't been back there in a long time, but -
ANITA I'm not interested in any memorial.
BLOMKVIST I understand.
ANITA What do you understand?
BLOMKVIST That you don't really care for any of your relatives.
BLOMKVIST Still, I thought you should know.
ANITA Now I know.
ANITA And now, she closes the door.
Blomkvist returns to the van.
Climbs in.
SALANDER How'd it go?
BLOMKVIST Okay.
BLOMKVIST I think.
BLOMKVIST He sits and watches them monitor the phone and computer taps they installed earlier.
BLOMKVIST One of the laptops, without anyone touching it, blinks on to a Google screen.
TRINITY She's on.
TRINITY A screen name and password characters on a Gmail page type themselves.
TRINITY They expect her to go to "Compose," but she opens one of the messages - spam - deletes it - marks a couple more and banishes them as well.
TRINITY The only new thing left in the inbox is an eBay alert.
TRINITY Clicking it takes her to an auction for a triple-strand faux-pearl Jackie O necklace: 49 pounds.
TRINITY The cursor clicks the Buy-It-Now button.
TRINITY As the screen switches to Anita's Paypal account, Blomkvist and Salander exchange a confused glance.
Salander's laptop is monitoring Anita's computer, her hard-line phone and cell.
Blomkvist emerges from the bathroom, rests a hand on Salander's shoulder to peer over it at the screen: In one of the windows, cards are dealing themselves.
BLOMKVIST She's playing solitaire?
BLOMKVIST And she still hasn't called anyone.
SALANDER No.
BLOMKVIST Do we have her cell, too?
BLOMKVIST Salander points to one of the windows on the screen.
BLOMKVIST His hand comes off her shoulder.
BLOMKVIST I was so she'd lead us to her.
SALANDER Put your hand back on my shoulder.
SALANDER He does.
SALANDER They watch the solitaire game together ...
SALANDER There's only one reason she wouldn't call Harriet.
SALANDER She can't because Harriet is indeed dead.
It's strange perhaps, but he does some of his best thinking during sex -
BLOMKVIST I was just thinking.
BLOMKVIST What if -
SALANDER Ten more seconds.
SALANDER That's fair.
SALANDER She finishes.
SALANDER They lie there.
SALANDER Then -
SALANDER Okay, what.
BLOMKVIST I was just thinking, there could be one other possibility.
Blomkvist taps on Anita's open office door.
BLOMKVIST May I?
ANITA What is it now.
ANITA He comes in and sits.
BLOMKVIST I want to show you something.
BLOMKVIST He tugs his shirt collar low enough to reveal the black and blue "tattoo" around his neck.
BLOMKVIST Anita is taken aback by the sight.
BLOMKVIST It's hard to imagine how anyone would end up with a mark like that.
BLOMKVIST Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook ...
BLOMKVIST Harriet.
They sit together on a park bench.
BLOMKVIST Anita married in Stockholm in 1967.
BLOMKVIST It's recorded in the Swedish General Register.
BLOMKVIST But the family never knew, did they.
BLOMKVIST I'm guessing she then came here on a passport in her married name, and you followed on her maiden name passport.
HARRIET Actually, it was the other way around.
HARRIET She thought it safer for me to travel with Spencer myself.
BLOMKVIST What did he think about that?
HARRIET Nothing.
HARRIET Only that he loved her.
HARRIET She said, If you love me, you'll do this and not ask why.
HARRIET He never did.
BLOMKVIST They both died twenty years ago.
HARRIET A car accident.
HARRIET You found that, too.
HARRIET Blomkvist nods, reaches for something in his jacket pocket - changes his mind - changes it again and pulls it out.
BLOMKVIST Is this you?
BLOMKVIST He hands her the less graphic of the two Polaroids Salander found in Martin's basement - the young girl, face turned half-away from the camera ...
HARRIET I was 14 the first time he raped me.
BLOMKVIST Martin.
HARRIET No, my father.
HARRIET He took this picture.
HARRIET Martin didn't start until he died.
HARRIET Blomkvist can't hide his horror even after all he's seen.
BLOMKVIST Why didn't you tell someone?
HARRIET I did.
HARRIET My mother.
HARRIET Blomkvist stares.
HARRIET Finally -
BLOMKVIST Henrik would have done something.
HARRIET Would he?
HARRIET I don't know.
HARRIET I almost told him.
HARRIET But I was afraid because of what I did.
HARRIET You still don't understand?
HARRIET He doesn't.
HARRIET She studies him, and perhaps sees in him what Salander did long ago - that he can be trusted.
HARRIET A year after the first time - after many times during that year - my father got drunker than usual one night and started bragging about women he'd killed.
HARRIET He quoted from the Bible as he tore off my clothes.
HARRIET He wrapped a belt around my neck.
HARRIET He wanted to kill me.
Harriet makes it out of the cabin in torn clothing, trying to get the belt around her neck off.
Her father can heard inside ranting something from the Bible.
HARRIET V/O I made it out of the house and down to the dock.
HARRIET V/O He came staggering after me - Gottfried emerges from the cabin and stumbles down the hill in pursuit of his almost-naked daughter.
HARRIET V/O I could never fight him off in a small room, but I was strong enough out in the open to deal with an old drunk.
146. As he comes onto the dock, she waits for the moment, and smashes him in the head with the flat side of an oar.
146. It stuns and sends him toppling off the dock into the water.
146. He surfaces, reaches for the dock planks.
146. As he takes hold of them to claw himself from the water, she brings the sharp edge of the oar down, burying it in his head like an axe.
146. He stares up her, uncomprehending.
146. His fingers slide away from the dock.
146. His body goes limp and sinks out of sight beneath the water.
HARRIET V/O When it was finally over I looked up, and Martin was standing there -
HARRIET V/O She sees her brother up by the cabin looking down at her.
HARRIET V/O With a little smile.
HARRIET He dragged me back to the cabin ...
HARRIET All I'd accomplished was substitute one rapist for another.
Young Harriet and her school friends walk along the town's main street past crowds lining it, and we realize we're seeing what we've only seen in still photographs.
HARRIET V/O A couple months later, Henrik sent him off to school in Uppsala.
HARRIET V/O And I thought maybe - maybe - the nightmare was over.
HARRIET V/O Until that day.
HARRIET V/O The float with the harem girls comes past, and we watch the smile on young Harriet's face change to fear as she notices something off to the left.
HARRIET V/O There he was - across the street - looking at me with that same little smile on his face.
HARRIET V/O A clear shot of young Martin in his Uppsala blazer, standing by the corner, smiling at her.
HARRIET V/O It wasn't over.
BLOMKVIST How'd you get away?
BLOMKVIST Anita?
Anita, framed in the bedroom window - like in the photograph - looks out at the activity on the bridge.
Behind her, Harriet packs a few items of clothing.
ANITA Don't take anything.
ANITA Harriet puts the clothes back.
ANITA Picks up her purse.
ANITA Leave that, too.
The dinner that night.
Vanger noticing Harriet's empty chair.
And Anita saying nothing, taking a bite of food.
The searchers scouring the island.
The boats moving along the shoreline.
The crane lifting the truck from the bridge.
Anita climbs into her car outside her father Harald's house.
Drives down the road toward the bridge.
ANITA Stay absolutely still.
ANITA The blanket covering Harriet on the backseat floorboard moves slightly, then is still.
ANITA A policeman on the island side of the bridge waves the car across it.
ANITA As it heads along the mainland service road toward the highway -
HARRIET V/O She saved me.
Silence.
Then she gestures to Blomkvist's neck.
HARRIET How did you get away?
BLOMKVIST Someone saved me, too.
148. He gestures off to the thin, strange girl sitting on another park bench too far away to hear them.
148. Harriet does something she hasn't done since they met: smile.
Blomkvist, Salander and Frode wait in Vanger's study.
A tea service tray sits there untouched like the first time Blomkvist came here.
Anna pushes a wheelchair into the room with Vanger in it.
There's a file on his lap.
BLOMKVIST How are you feeling?
VANGER I'm fine.
VANGER Thank you, Anna.
VANGER Anna leaves.
VANGER Closes the doors.
VANGER Before Blomkvist can say anything else -
VANGER I made you a promise.
VANGER Whether you found out anything or not.
He holds out the file.
Blomkvist takes it and sees: INSERT: Wennerstorm's name typed on it, and a fairly recent photo of him clipped to it.
VANGER Now.
VANGER What do you have to tell me.
A car pulls up the drive.
Parks.
The back door opens.
Harriet climbs out.
Looks at the manor.
Then walks toward the front door -
Vanger propels his wheelchair down the main hall, but stops when he sees Harriet coming in the front door with Anna.
He stares, trying to reconcile how she looks now compared to when he last saw her, or maybe to convince himself she's really alive.
She sees him ...
HARRIET Hi, Henrik.
HARRIET He begins to weep.
HARRIET She walks to him and places a hand on his hunched shaking shoulders.
HARRIET Frode, Blomkvist and Salander watch.
HARRIET One of them isn't particularly moved.
As Frode leafs through the file that Blomkvist has already read -
FRODE ...
FRODE I don't even remember Wennerstrom working here, much less being fired ...
BLOMKVIST Why would you.
BLOMKVIST It was a long time ago.
BLOMKVIST Which is more to the point than the money he embezzled.
FRODE I don't think I'm seeing the point.
BLOMKVIST Yes, you are.
FRODE It happened in the 1970's ...
FRODE Salander watches the two men from across the room ...
FRODE (ADR) I swear I didn't know this was what Henrik had on him.
FRODE (ADR) If I had, I never would have let him bring you up here.
FRODE (ADR) But he wasn't trying to deceive you.
BLOMKVIST Come on, he knows you can't try somebody for this 35 years later.
BLOMKVIST I like Henrik, but he knows that.
BLOMKVIST Frode disagrees -
FRODE A man's reputation used to mean something - he still believes that.
FRODE I'm sure he thought you could destroy Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion.
BLOMKVIST The "court of public opinion," Dirch, makes celebrities out of girls who shop.
BLOMKVIST Henrik promised me Wennerstrom's carcass on a plate.
BLOMKVIST This isn't even the plate.
BLOMKVIST I can't do anything with this.
FRODE Of course you're right ...
FRODE I'm sorry.
Blomkvist and Salander sit out by the water, sharing the last cigarette in his pack.
Her arm is draped over his shoulder, which strikes him as the most tender of gestures, coming from her.
SALANDER Fuck these people ...
BLOMKVIST Yeah ...
SALANDER Harriet most of all.
BLOMKVIST Excuse me?
SALANDER If she'd done anything but run, Martin wouldn't have been able to kill all those women.
BLOMKVIST She had no idea he was doing it.
SALANDER She should have killed her father and him.
BLOMKVIST That's what you would've done.
BLOMKVIST Not everyone's you.
BLOMKVIST She's not sure she likes the comment.
BLOMKVIST Decides she doesn't.
BLOMKVIST Takes her arm away from his shoulder.
BLOMKVIST That was meant to be a compliment.
BLOMKVIST Put your arm back on my shoulder.
BLOMKVIST She doesn't.
BLOMKVIST So he drapes his on hers.
BLOMKVIST Then -
SALANDER What happened with Wennerstrom.
SALANDER How did he get you?
BLOMKVIST I was stupid.
BLOMKVIST I got something from an anonymous source, who I'm sure now worked for him.
BLOMKVIST It was fake.
BLOMKVIST Which he easily proved in court.
BLOMKVIST Not a good day, that.
BLOMKVIST Then -
SALANDER You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life was illegal and immoral.
SALANDER Would you feel the same about Wennerstrom?
SALANDER He regards her, uncertain what she means ...
SALANDER I started investigating him on my own.
SALANDER Then you showed up and hired me.
SALANDER I haven't had a chance to look at it all - you and Harriet-fucking- Vanger have kept me busy ...
SALANDER but I may have something.
BLOMKVIST On Wennerstrom.
BLOMKVIST She nods.
BLOMKVIST Then rests her head on his shoulder.
A new family tree on a wall here, more complicated than the Vanger's: The Wennerstrom Group, made up of dozens of companies in cities worldwide.
As Erika looks at it -
BLOMKVIST Wennerstrom's Swedish assets are genuine, but they're the only things that are.
BLOMKVIST The rest is funneled through companies in Gibraltar, Colombia, and Macao.
BLOMKVIST These companies produce no products and provide no services.
BLOMKVIST They're shells.
BLOMKVIST They launder money from arms and drug sales, and crime syndicates in Russia.
BLOMKVIST And that money - which accounts for all but 5-percent of his holdings - ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands.
BLOMKVIST It's a completely illegal, criminal empire.
ERIKA How do you know this?
BLOMKVIST This time you don't want to know.
ERIKA This time I do want to know.
BLOMKVIST I have access to his computer, and his accountants' and lawyers'.
BLOMKVIST She isn't happy to hear that explanation.
ERIKA And how do you have that?
BLOMKVIST I could have gotten it from a source inside the company.
ERIKA But you didn't.
BLOMKVIST But that's what you'll say.
ERIKA But what will you say to me?
BLOMKVIST That depends on if you really want to know.
ERIKA I do.
ERIKA Who gave you access?
ERIKA What looks like 16-year-old tattooed runaway lets herself in with her own key.
ERIKA Crosses past Erika with a paper bag, takes out two bagel sandwiches, the same kind Blomkvist brought when he barged into her apartment.
ERIKA As she puts some water on for coffee, Erika looks at Blomkvist.
ERIKA He nods.
ERIKA Yeah.
ERIKA Her.
ANNOUNCER Journalist Mikael Blomkvist - who this time last year was convicted of libel in a Stockholm courtroom - doesn't seem to have learned from that experience.
ANNOUNCER Or maybe he has -
The report continues on a TV in Blomkvist's bedroom -
153. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
ANNOUNCER In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the same company that successfully sued him - The Wennerstrom Group - of criminal activities on a global scale - backing it up with internal financial reports, bank records and emails - annotations almost as long as the article itself.
The cover of the magazine features a head shot of Wennerstrom, and, rare for the magazine, a tabloid-style title: GANGLAND.
Salander leafs through the article as Blomkvist brushes his teeth in the bathroom.
BLOMKVIST He'll call it a personal vendetta but it won't work.
BLOMKVIST FI can't ignore banking and securities fraud like this.
BLOMKVIST The police can't ignore the organized crime stuff.
BLOMKVIST They'll both have to investigate.
SALANDER Then.
BLOMKVIST We'll be back in court, but this time it'll cost him.
BLOMKVIST That's probably it, though.
BLOMKVIST These guys never to prison.
Salander nods, but it's not really in agreement.
Or maybe it is.
In any case, she's not as enthused about all this as he is.
BLOMKVIST What's wrong.
SALANDER It's embarrassing.
BLOMKVIST What.
SALANDER I need to borrow some money.
Blomkvist grins and reaches for his wallet.
50,000. His grin stays stitched to his face a moment, then unravels.
50,000. He puts his wallet away.
SALANDER I have a chance to make an investment.
SALANDER It's a smart, safe investment.
BLOMKVIST I don't know that I have that much.
SALANDER You do.
SALANDER I'm sorry that I know that.
SALANDER You have 65 thousand in your two accounts.
SALANDER He's no longer shocked or dismayed by her knowing more about his personal affairs than he does.
SALANDER You'll get the money back.
SALANDER I promise.
Several pages torn from pages of fashion magazines: Models - all of them blonde - their beautiful faces - designer clothes - accessories - make-up tips.
Applying makeup to the wasp tattoo on her neck and the "handcuffs" on her wrists, Salander pays no attention to the TV showing Wennerstrom under an umbrella, interviewed outside the building that bears his name -
WENNERSTROM These allegations - like the last ones from this so-called journalist - are as ridiculous as they are untrue -
Salander purchases with cash expensive designer clothes she normally wouldn't be caught dead in.
WENNERSTROM I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again.
WENNERSTROM I'm looking forward to it.
Here she's buying a high-end carry-on valise and portfolio briefcase.
REPORTER What about his documentation?
WENNERSTROM Fabricated.
WENNERSTROM All of it.
Good wigs cost money - like the shoulder-length blonde one atop a black Lucite head Salander is purchasing.
ANNOUNCER The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite as certain as Mr. Wennerstrom of that.
A place that caters to transvestites who, among other things, require as Salander does, latex breasts.
FSA OFFICIAL If even a fraction of what Mr.
FSA OFFICIAL Blomkvist is alleging proves to be true, not only will there be a securities investigation, but an organized crime inquiry as well.
Wearing the wig and a designer outfit she takes her own passport photo against a wall.
She looks like Erika.
REPORTER Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.
FSA OFFICIAL And we can't force him to.
FSA OFFICIAL But we can look for them.
REPORTER Beginning where?
FSA OFFICIAL Beginning with those closest to Mr.
FSA OFFICIAL Wennerstrom.
FSA OFFICIAL Only someone in the inner circle of a corporation like this could have access to this kind of information.
Not wearing the wig now, she inspects a passport Plague has acquired for her featuring the crown of Norway, and some credit cards.
156. On his TV, a pack of lawyers stand where Wennerstrom was standing before - outside the Group's corporate offices - under, as usual, umbrellas -
LAWYER Mr. Wennerstrom isn't available for comment today, but as his legal counsel, I'd be happy to answer your questions.
REPORTER Where is he?
LAWYER At home, I imagine.
REPORTER He isn't.
REPORTER Has he left the country?
LAWYER I don't think so.
A plane touches down on a Zurich Airport runway.
A customs official, satisfied with "Irene Nesser's" Norwegian passport - not to mention her blonde hair and bustline - stamps a page.
Bellmen outside the 5-Star Zimmerstahl Hotel attend to the luggage of wealthy guests emerging from nice cars.
As a desk clerk photocopies Ms. Nesser's passport, she neither hides from nor plays to the security camera.
Salander emerges from the bathroom without the wig on.
Crosses through the suite in her underwear.
Oddly - or perhaps not - she's also wearing a pair of white gloves.
She opens the balcony's doors to let in some air.
On the TV:
ANNOUNCER With his failure to appear before a Security Exchange Commission panel, a warrant has been issued for The Wennerstrom Group CEO.
157. An immigration official appears before the news cameras -
IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL I can confirm that he left Sweden on a private jet that landed in Paris last week, but whether he's still there, we don't know.
IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL He could be anywhere by now.
IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL She sips at her room service coffee.
"Irene Nesser" enters Bank Hausen General under watchful security cameras.
Security cameras inside watch her and a banker at a desk in an area reserved for discreet transactions.
SALANDER I have a number of accounts at Bank of Kroenfeld, Cayman Islands.
SALANDER I want to transfer those funds and convert them to bonds.
SALANDER As she writes an account number on a slip of paper from memory, Herr Wagner notices - as she intends - the pen she's using - from the venerable Zimmerstal Hotel.
WAGNER Naturally, you have the clearing codes.
SALANDER Naturally.
WAGNER How many accounts will you be transferring?
SALANDER Thirty.
SALANDER He glances at his watch, perhaps thinking about lunch.
SALANDER His faux-politeness - even his appearance - reminds her of Bjurman.
WAGNER This will take some time.
SALANDER For which you'll receive a 4-percent commission.
WAGNER I will.
SALANDER Then it won't be a waste of it.
SALANDER She offers him the Zimmerstal pen.
WAGNER Thank you, I have one.
WAGNER He picks up one of his cheap pens.
WAGNER She hands him a long list of account numbers and clearing codes -
As she sorts through a stack of bonds, the TV shows a reporter in a colorful town square.
REPORTER A Swedish tourist vacationing here in Barbados says he knows where fugitive
financier Hans-Erik Wennerstrom is: Here in this Caribbean island's capital, Bridgetown.
Police released this photograph, taken yesterday by the tourist, Jens Assur - A snapshot of Wennerstrom, or someone who looks like him - tropical shirt, hat and sunglasses - climbing into a car.
REPORTER - and say they believe it is the disgraced billionaire.
Sitting with a different bank manager now as security cameras keep silent watch, she opens her portfolio and turns it so he can see its contents.
He glances up with a polite smile that's supposed to mask his surprise.
HASSELMAN How many of these would you like to convert for deposit?
SALANDER All fifty.
SALANDER Into five accounts.
SALANDER He works out the conversion to CHF and hands her the calculator: A "2" followed by more digits than we can count.
SALANDER That looks correct.
The remnants of a McDonald's kids meal on the desk with the wig and white gloves.
She bypasses the hotel's internet service, uplinks her MacBook through her cell.
Five accounts - the ones she just established at Bank Dorfrmann - appear on the screen.
She transfers all the funds into one account at Bank Kroenfeld, Cayman Islands, belonging to a Gibraltar company.
Irene cuts up credit cards, flushes them down a toilet.
Drops the scissors in a trash bin on her way to security.
Irene disembarks with the other Zurich flight passengers.
Irene's earrings disappear down a sink drain.
Necklace falls to the bottom of a paper towel bin.
Irene/Salander puts her empty portfolio in an unlocked locker, wipes the prints from it, heads for the platform.
She has a private sleeping berth, but isn't sleeping.
She's smoking a cigarette next to a No-Smoking decal on the window that's cracked open, and tosses the Zimmerstal Hotel pen out to the darkening countryside rushing past.
Salander - looking like Salander - enters her apartment with only her laptop bag.
Holds Irene's passport over a stove flame.
Sets the burning document on a plate.
Takes a Coke from her fridge, sits with it.
Puts the cold can to her forehead like a compress.
Then opens it, drinks, and closes her eyes ...
A dark figure is looking up at her apartment, at television light playing on a window.
As he walks off into the night, we see it's Bjurman.
ZURICH REPORTER O/S The man who is now being called Sweden's Pablo Escobar, may not have a country to call home, but does have enough money to buy one.
The reporter stands under an umbrella on the same street Salander crossed to get from one hotel to the other.
ZURICH REPORTER According to the International Banking Commission, Wennerstrom, just days after the Millennium article that brought him down appeared on news stands, began emptying accounts at Bank of Kroenfeld in the Cayman Islands.
The place is trimmed with Christmas decorations again.
In a glassed-in conference room, Blomkvist, Erika, and a few others sit around the table, their production meeting interrupted by the news on the plasma TV here:
ZURICH REPORTER ON TV That money, approximately two billion Euros, was then spread over a number of accounts with the help of this confederate, seen here in Zurich -
ZURICH REPORTER ON TV Security camera images of "Irene Nesser," entering and leaving banks.
ZURICH REPORTER ON TV - who converted the funds into private bonds, which, I'm told, are even harder to trace than Wennerstrom himself.
ZURICH REPORTER ON TV Europol has launched a search for the woman who had used a stolen Norwegian passport.
ZURICH REPORTER ON TV Her whereabouts, like her boss's, are unknown.
Her whereabouts are here, roaring through Stockholm on her Honda like the first time we saw her.
Blomkvist hears a motorcycle and glances out the window to see Salander pulling up outside.
He comes out, meets her at her motorcycle.
She takes a cashier's check from her jacket pocket.
SALANDER The money I borrowed.
BLOMKVIST Already.

SALANDER Erika regards them from inside the conference room.
SALANDER Salander climbs back on her motorcycle.
SALANDER Christmas again ...
SALANDER see you soon.
While the nurse fills a plastic days-of-the-week container with a concoction of pills, Salander sits with her Palmgren by the untouched chess table.
SALANDER Can you hear me?
SALANDER I miss our meetings.
SALANDER I'm sure you don't.
SALANDER Why would you?
SALANDER I was always such a headache for you.
SALANDER Never showing up with good news.
SALANDER Only problems.
SALANDER I have some good news now.
SALANDER I've made a friend.
SALANDER I mean one that you'd approve of.
SALANDER I'm happy.
SALANDER One of Palmgren's hands manages to pull slightly away from the other, tries to reach for her, perhaps, but only makes it about an inch.
SALANDER She reaches over and holds it.
A reporter bundled-up outside a low-rent building cordoned off with police tape -
REPORTER Behind the walls of this dingy rooming house behind me lies a body in a pool of blood - A man who has been living here the last three weeks under the name Victor Fleming -
The same cafe Blomkvist retreated to after his libel conviction.
REPORTER O/S A man who police in Marbella, Spain, have confirmed is fugitive Hans-Erik Wennerstrom -
Blomkvist is at the counter, across from a barista, but his attention is on the TV -
REPORTER ON TV - shot three times in the head at close range in what is being called a classic gangland execution.
BARISTA What would you like?
BARISTA Blomkvist glances blankly at the barista, then back to the TV -
REPORTER ON TV The investigation into Wennerstrom's ties to crime organizations worldwide will now turn to speculation: Which of them caught up with him before Swedish authorities could?
BARISTA Sir?
REPORTER ON TV Wennerstrom spent the last days of his flamboyant life in solitude and anonymity, locked behind the door of Room 3A -
BLOMKVIST ...
BLOMKVIST Coffee and a sandwich ...
BLOMKVIST that one.
REPORTER ON TV Indeed, after checking in, he was never seen again - until this morning when the building manager came calling to collect the unpaid bill -
A tailor brings out a garment bag bearing his exclusive insignia, drapes it across a table, returns to Salander the photograph she provided him with last week: It's of a much younger Blomkvist - at about Salander's age now - wearing the black leather jacket he loved and lost track of years ago.
The tailor unzips the bag revealing an exact - though considerably more expensive - replica of the jacket.
SALANDER It's perfect.
TAILOR Your father?
SALANDER A friend.
TAILOR Must be a very good friend.
TAILOR He's lucky.
A perfect Christmas card vista that actually turns out to be a Christmas card: A snowy rural landscape scene.
It's stupid, but she's writing under the pre-printed "Merry Christmas" inside, a personal note that's more sincere than she thought herself capable.
She blows on the ink, puts the card in its envelope, neatly writes "Mikael" on it, gets up -
Snow's falling, but unlike the brutal winter storms last year, it's just heavy enough to dust the city in white powder that reflects the Christmas lights in the trees.
The beauty of her city pleases Salander as she rides through it on her motorcycle.
Or maybe it's something she's feeling as she turns onto Blomkvist's street.
She parks.
Gathers the garment bag and card, walks under construction scaffolding toward his apartment building.
From around the corner ahead, Blomkvist and Erika appear.
He says something and she laughs, puts her arm around his waist and lays her head against his neck scarf.
Salander stops mid-stride, ducks into an alcove under the scaffolding, waits as long as it should take them to get inside the building, then peers out again - They're not inside.
They've stopped just outside the building's entrance.
They're embracing.
And the longer they stand there together, the sharper the pain stabs at Salander.
Finally they separate, but only to allow Blomkvist to unlock the door.
Erika takes his hand then, and they disappear inside.
Salander can't move.
Waits for the pain to subside - which it eventually does - but only to be replaced with a sense of helplessness.
Then that subsides, replaced with a facade of insouciance.
The richest girl in Sweden emerges from the alcove and walks back the way she came - tossing the garment bag and card into a construction dumpster - climbs onto her Honda - starts it - and drives off -
Probably forever.</pre><br> <table width="85%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="body" style="BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;">
