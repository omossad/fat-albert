MILK
Written by

Close on a finger pressing the "record" button of a circa 1970's tape recorder.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) This is Harvey Milk speaking on Friday November 18th.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) This is to be played only in the event of my death by assassination...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) REVEAL: HARVEY MILK, 48, sitting at his kitchen table in a cluttered San Francisco apartment.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) During one of the early campaigns, I started opening my speeches with the same line and it sort of became my signature...
In street clothes, trying to corral an angry mob on City Hall's steps, Harvey lifts a bullhorn.
HARVEY MILK Hello, I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm here to recruit you.
Harvey at his kitchen table making his recording...
HARVEY MILK If I was speaking to a slightly hostile or mostly straight audience, I'd try to break the tension with a joke...
Harvey is in a plain, ill fitting brown suit making a CAMPAIGN SPEECH to a crowd of stone faced UNION BOYS.
HARVEY MILK I know, I know, I'm not what you were expecting, but I left my high heels at home.
HARVEY MILK Harvey gets a LAUGH from the AUDIENCE.
RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder.
HARVEY MILK I fully realize that a person who stands for what I stand for - an activist, a gay activist - becomes the target or potential target for a person who is insecure, terrified, afraid or very disturbed themselves...
POLICE OFFICERS AND PRESS RACE THROUGH THE HALLS of City Hall, their walkie-talkies squawking.
Something terrible has happened.
It's chaos.
A STRETCHER IS WHEELED OUT OF AN OFFICE.
On it, a FILLED BODY BAG with a WHITE SHEET draped over it.
The press rush to get a shot.
The police officers quickly load the body onto the elevator and disappear from sight.
A shell shocked DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 45, wades into a throng of REPORTERS.
Those surrounding her try to quiet the crowd.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN As President of the Board of Supervisors, it's my duty to make this announcement.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN Both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot...
DIANNE FEINSTEIN and killed.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN GASPS from the REPORTERS.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN Dianne struggles to be heard.
Police are looking for a suspect...
Supervisor Dan White.
The very picture of loveliness, MARY-ANN WHITE, 28, finds her husband DAN WHITE, 31, sitting in the pews praying.
He's a handsome, devout, all-American man in a three-piece suit.
She sits by him.
A weight hangs.
He can't make eye contact.
DAN WHITE Something has happened.
She puts her arm around him, feels a gun at his side.
She holds him, firmly gripping the revolver in his holster, to conceal, to keep him from using it, potentially on himself.
RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder...
HARVEY MILK Knowing that I could be assassinated at any moment, I feel it's important that some people should understand my thoughts.
HARVEY MILK I think that--
HARVEY MILK I wish I had time to explain everything I did.
HARVEY MILK Almost everything that was done was done with an eye on the gay movement.
CLEAN WHITE LETTERS ON A BLACK SCREEN READ a??MILK"
TITLE: "New York City.
1970."
HARVEY, 40, is HEADING UP THE STAIRS from the subway platform.
He is wearing a SUIT, but he's less than clean cut.
His hair is brushing past his ears.
HARVEY'S VERY INTERESTED POV: SCOTT SMITH, 22, a sexy curly haired hippie in tight jeans and boots, is HEADING DOWN THE THE STAIRS.
Harvey tries to make eye contact.
HARVEY MILK Hey.
HARVEY MILK I'm Harvey.
SCOTT SMITH Okay, Harvey...
HARVEY MILK Today's my birthday.
HARVEY MILK No, today is actually my birthday.
HARVEY MILK Well, tonight.
HARVEY MILK At midnight.
SCOTT SMITH Really?
HARVEY MILK And, believe it or not, I don't have any plans.
HARVEY MILK People took me out after work...
SCOTT SMITH Work?
SCOTT SMITH So, that would be...
SCOTT SMITH Let me guess.
SCOTT SMITH Ma Bell or AT&T.
HARVEY MILK The Great American Insurance Company.
HARVEY MILK I'm part of the big, evil, corporate establishment that, let me guess, you think is the cause of every evil thing in the world from Vietnam to diaper rash.
SCOTT SMITH You left out bad breath.
SCOTT SMITH Falling for it, Harvey covers his mouth.
SCOTT SMITH Scott laughs.
SCOTT SMITH They both smile, realizing they share a wry sense of humor.
SCOTT SMITH A TRAIN IS COMING, Harvey has to work fast.
HARVEY MILK So...
HARVEY MILK You're not going to let me celebrate my birthday all by myself are you?
SCOTT SMITH Listen, Harvey, you're kind of cute for a suit...
SCOTT SMITH But I don't do guys over forty.
HARVEY MILK Well then, I'm in luck.
SCOTT SMITH How's that?
HARVEY MILK Because I'm still thirty-nine...
HARVEY MILK And it's only eleven-fifteen.
IN A TIGHT TWO-SHOT, Scott is pressed against a wall with Harvey pressed against his back having sex.
Harvey is the aggressor, completely uninhibited.
OPERA MUSIC PLAYS on a record player.
(Wagner's Tristan and
Harvey feeds Scott spoonfuls of CREAM PIE from a TRAY FULL of FOOD that rests on the bed between them.
Ice cream, cookies, milk, berries...
It's over the top and adorable.
HARVEY MILK Where are you from?
SCOTT SMITH Jackson, Mississippi.
HARVEY MILK Well, this isn't Jackson, but you still can't respond to every strange man you meet on a subway platform.
HARVEY MILK It's too dangerous.
SCOTT SMITH Now you tell me.
HARVEY MILK There's nothing tougher than a New York City cop.
HARVEY MILK They're arrogant, and they're everywhere.
HARVEY MILK I'll show you the cruising spots, if you want, if you promise you'll be careful...
HARVEY MILK little Scottie-san.
SCOTT SMITH Are you on uppers or what?
HARVEY MILK No.
HARVEY MILK This is just...
HARVEY MILK plain old me.
SCOTT SMITH You're afraid of the cops?
HARVEY MILK I'm just discreet.
HARVEY MILK I know a lot of people here.
HARVEY MILK If they found out, I could lose my job.
SCOTT SMITH Oh.
SCOTT SMITH You're one of "those."
SCOTT SMITH I think you need a change of scenery.
SCOTT SMITH New friends.
HARVEY MILK I need a change.
SCOTT SMITH You're forty now.
HARVEY MILK Forty years old and I haven't done a thing I'm proud of.
SCOTT SMITH You keep eating like this and you'll be a fat ass by fifty.
HARVEY MILK No.
HARVEY MILK Don't you worry.
HARVEY MILK I won't make it to fifty.
HARVEY MILK Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding, he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face.
HARVEY MILK Harvey reacts.
HARVEY MILK Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his young, frisky new lover.
HARVEY MILK They kiss.
HARVEY MILK The mess getting everywhere.
HARVEY MILK Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) (an idea, half-jokingly,
Why don't we run away together?
SCOTT SMITH Where to?
RETURN TO: Harvey speaks to the tape recorder.
(Throughout the film, these scenes should feel intimate, as if Harvey is telling us things no one else knows.)
HARVEY MILK In those days, San Francisco was the place where everyone wanted to go...
HARVEY MILK To drop out...
HARVEY MILK To fall in love...
8MM HOME MOVIE MONTAGE of Harvey and Scott DRESSED FULL-OUT LIKE HIPPIES, long hair, beard, beads, sunglasses, driving
through the redwoods, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and into San Francisco.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) But by 1972, The Haight was boarded up.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Crime-filled.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Drug-filled.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) The new place for us refugees was this run down Irish Catholic neighborhood in Eureka Valley.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Six blocks square...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) The Castro.
Harvey lifts a Nikon camera and starts SNAPPING PHOTOS of Castro Street.
a LIQUOR STORE, empty buildings, boarded windows...
Harvey points the camera toward The MARQUEE of the Castro Theater, big letters spelling out...
"C A S T R O..."
Harvey points his camera across the street at the gray- haired, OWNER of a liquor store.
Harvey snaps PHOTOS of his face, an expression of distrust.
Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads:
Harvey's CAMERA focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS WALKING PAST, one puts his arm over the other.
To Harvey's eyes it's a very new site.
It's overt.
Thrilling.
Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT SIGN hanging out front.
The place is FILLED with OPERA MUSIC from a record player.
Harvey is loading a roll of film into his camera.
Scott is getting high, lying in the sun that pours through the large, empty windows.
SCOTT SMITH I cashed my last unemployment check yesterday...
HARVEY MILK Well, I hope you did something useful with it.
SCOTT SMITH I bought an ounce of pot.
SCOTT SMITH I was just wondering if you had any
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) plans, or thoughts...
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) About us doing something to, you know, bring in an income.
HARVEY MILK Don't move.
HARVEY MILK Harvey straddles Scott.
HARVEY MILK He begins SNAPPING PHOTOS of him.
SCOTT SMITH I suppose I can wait tables.
HARVEY No way.
HARVEY I want you right here with me...
HARVEY Did you see place downstairs is for rent?
SCOTT SMITH Yeah.
HARVEY MILK I was thinking we could open a shop together.
SCOTT SMITH What kind of shop?
HARVEY MILK One with very little overhead.
HARVEY MILK Not too much work...
HARVEY MILK A little one, just like Morris and Minnie Milk of Woodmere, New York...
Harvey's empty store front has been converted to a CAMERA STORE (with a few, not very impressive, products).
Harvey is out on the sidewalk directing Scott who is inside the store's large window hanging a sign: "CASTRO CAMERA."
HARVEY MILK Just a little to the left...
HARVEY MILK The old liquor store owner from earlier, MCCONNELLY, crosses
the street to watch.
Harvey gives him a warm welcome:
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Hello there.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I'm Harvey Milk.
MCCONNELLY You're the new renters?
HARVEY MILK Yes.
HARVEY MILK Welcome to Castro Camera.
Harvey extends his hand.
McConnelly shakes, but is wary.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I want to join the, um...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) What is it?
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) The Eureka Valley Merchant's Association.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I want to help in any way possible.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I'm no interloper.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) A Jew perhaps, but I hope you'll forgive that.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window.
MCCONNELLY I don't think your application will be approved, Mr. Milk.
MCCONNELLY This is a family neighborhood.
MCCONNELLY Your kind are far more welcome on Haight street.
HARVEY MILK What "kind" do you mean, sir?
MCCONNELLY The Merchant's Association will have the police pull your license if you open your doors.
SCOTT SMITH Based on what law?
MCCONNELLY There's man's law and there's God's law in this neighborhood and in this City.
MCCONNELLY The San Francisco Police force is happy to enforce either.
HARVEY MILK Thanks for the warm welcome to the neighborhood!
SCOTT SMITH We pay taxes you know!
SCOTT SMITH Harvey grabs Scott's hand...
SCOTT SMITH keeps him from heating up, from pouncing.
SCOTT SMITH It's not the time for them to bite yet.
Scott is sitting on the bed, while Harvey is TALKING A MILE A MINUTE FROM THE KITCHEN, totally energized.
HARVEY MILK We'll form our own business association!
HARVEY MILK Start with the gay- owned businesses...
HARVEY MILK We'll take down the addresses of every customer that comes in for a roll of film.
HARVEY MILK We'll ask them what they want to see done here...
HARVEY MILK what they want changed...
HARVEY MILK We'll get money rolling into this neighborhood.
HARVEY MILK Revitalize it...
SCOTT SMITH Can I come in now?
HARVEY MILK One more minute!
HARVEY MILK I'll go to the neighborhood banks.
HARVEY MILK They must have some gay customers.
SCOTT SMITH Harvey.
SCOTT SMITH What's with all this political activist crap?
SCOTT SMITH I thought you were a goddamn Republican.
SCOTT SMITH Harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of food.
SCOTT SMITH He sets them out on a small dining room table, still rambling on to Scott in the bedroom.
HARVEY MILK I'm a businessman, Scott.
HARVEY MILK I think businesses ought to treat their customers right.
HARVEY MILK Even their gay customers.
HARVEY MILK For God's sake, this is San Francisco!
SCOTT SMITH Harvey.
SCOTT SMITH It's just like every other city in this country.
SCOTT SMITH People hate us.
SCOTT SMITH Big surprise.
HARVEY MILK We should have at least one block in one city right?
HARVEY MILK Start there and take over the neighborhood.
HARVEY MILK Okay, you can come in now!
HARVEY MILK Scott heads toward the kitchen.
HARVEY MILK The table is LAID OUT with a home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS.
SCOTT SMITH Wow.
SCOTT SMITH This is--
Harvey SMASHES A CREAM PIE into Scott's face.
Payback.
HARVEY MILK Happy birthday!
HARVEY MILK Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear some of the CREAM PIE onto him.
The street is shut down for the first ever Castro Street Fair.
The crowd is mostly gay, the majority congregate outside Toad Hall bar.
ANGLE ON: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS milling about, eyeing the scene skeptically.
Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD with Scott, shaking hands.
Thanks for the party, Mr. Milk!
HARVEY MILK Thanks for joining the Castro Village Association!
HARVEY MILK Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the Irish liquor store (from earlier).
HARVEY MILK He squeezes past them, into the store, leaving Scott outside.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Excuse me gentleman...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) ladies.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Hello!
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Mr. McConnelly!
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new business.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I just wanted to stop in and see how business was doing.
MCCONNELLY Fine.
HARVEY MILK So you don't mind all these homosexuals in here, do you?
HARVEY MILK McConnelly grins, uncomfortable.
HARVEY MILK The line of gay men is curious about the hubbub.
HARVEY MILK Point made, Harvey does a 180.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) No.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) No.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Just a joke.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Mr. McConnelly here loves our kind.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Spend away!
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Tell your wife Hello for me.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM, KISSING HIM ON THE MOUTH.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) It's quite the show.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) They step back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playing.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Gay men watch.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Some clap.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Harvey grabs Scott and spins him through a sharp waltz.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) OFF the pair at home in their new neighborhood.
HARVEY MILK And people started hanging around our store.
HARVEY MILK Not customers.
HARVEY MILK Activists, kids, folks who needed a home away from home...
A NEW sign goes in the window: "We are VERY open."
A FEW YOUNG MEN are hanging out in the shop, the beginnings of Harvey's entourage.
Harvey moves among them, sharing a clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the arts, and checking out the cute ones.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute art student who I'd picked up at Toad Hall.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Turns out he was also good at running the Camera Shop...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) something Scott and I found we had surprising little interest in...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless.
DANNY NICCOLETTA Opera is passe, Harvey.
DANNY NICCOLETTA It's about street theater, now.
HARVEY MILK What you're not getting is the spectacle of it, the bigger than life emotions...
HARVEY MILK Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of an opera diva, making Harvey laugh.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Jim Rivaldo.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) A great mind.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) A great wit.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) A Harvard graduate, which nobody cared about, in those days, in the Castro...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) including himself.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that sits in front of Harvey's desk.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) He seems to be looking for something to occupy his keen mind.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) A sharply dressed young man, 20s, DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) And somewhere along the line Jim picked up a protege, a cute political kid from Wisconsin...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Dick Pabich...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) And of course there was Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular business with the new kids...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) DENNIS PERON hands Scott a FREE JOINT.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) And on occasion we actually had a real customer.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) But only occasionally.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a CUSTOMER, he's out of place: straight, gruff, a union man, ALLAN BAIRD, 40s.
SCOTT SMITH Harvey...
SCOTT SMITH This guy wants to talk to you.
HARVEY MILK Welcome.
HARVEY MILK What can we do for you?
ALLAN BAIRD Hi, I'm Allan Baird.
ALLAN BAIRD Teamsters representative, and Director of the Coors beer boycott in California.
HARVEY MILK Everyone, this is Allan Baird.
HARVEY MILK He's a very big deal, so behave yourselves.
ALLAN BAIRD I was told you were like the Mayor of the Castro, said you organized the CVA, you might know some people in the bars.
HARVEY MILK I do have friends in awfully low places, but just so you know, it's not official yet.
ALLAN BAIRD What's that?
HARVEY MILK The Mayor part.
HARVEY MILK I've considered gathering an army of queers to march up to City Hall and secede, but so far the young gays seem more interested in jeeps and jeans.
HARVEY MILK But if I could be of any use, I'm all ears!
ALLAN BAIRD We can't get Coors to go union.
ALLAN BAIRD These guys are like me, they can't be out of work too long.
ALLAN BAIRD Harvey pulls Allan aside, away from the audience, easing his nerves.
ALLAN BAIRD It's Harvey at his best.
HARVEY MILK I'm just curious.
HARVEY MILK Are we your first stop or your last?
ALLAN BAIRD It's been a tough one, Mr. Milk.
HARVEY MILK Well, you seem to have noticed that my kind of people drink a lot of beer.
HARVEY MILK If we're going to fast for your sake, I think we should get to deliver some of it when you win this fight, don't you?
Is that what you really want?
HARVEY MILK And allies.
HARVEY MILK I'll have Coors out of every bar in the Castro by the end of the week.
HARVEY MILK Deal?
ALLAN BAIRD Thank you Mr. Milk.
JUMP TO: Allan is on his way out.
Harvey walks back behind the counter to Scott.
HARVEY MILK No more Coors beer.
HARVEY MILK It's gotta come out of every bar.
HARVEY MILK Gay and straight.
SCOTT SMITH What's he giving you?
HARVEY MILK Nothing for me.
HARVEY MILK That's a convert.
SCOTT SMITH A convert to what?
HARVEY MILK The cause.
A STILL PHOTO MONTAGE: Jim, Dick, Scott and Danny get bar owners throughout San Francisco to unscrew their Coors taps, throw out their Coors stock, put on "Boycott Coors" buttons and tape up "Dump Coors" posters.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) I got "my people" to get Coors out of all the Gay Bars.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) 30 million bottles worth in San Francisco alone.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Coors beer immediately fell from number 1.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) They caved.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) One week later, union man Allan Baird hired the first ever openly gay union boys to drive Teamsters trucks...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) We weren't just a group of pansies anymore.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) We had a neighborhood.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) We had the unions.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) And for the first time, we had a little bit of power.
HARVEY MILK Maybe that was the day someone first called me the "Mayor" of Castro Street.
HARVEY MILK Or perhaps I invented it myself.
Harvey, Jim & Dick, Scott, Danny and Dennis debate the merits of working within "the system" versus dropping out.
Everyone is talking over each other...
A YOUNG GAY MAN runs into the store.
The fucking cops, man, they're up on Castro Street!
Toad Hall.
Harvey and the guys race out of the store.
Harvey, Scott, Jim, Dick, Dennis run up the street toward one of the Castro GAY BARS where POLICE ARE GETTING OUT OF SQUAD CARS AND APPROACHING CUSTOMERS crowding around the entrance.
COP Clear the sidewalk!
COP Some of the GAY MEN move out of the COPS' way but some of them don't move FAST ENOUGH.
COP The COPS start BEATING them.
COP Harvey, Scott and the OTHERS try to break into the crowd, to get closer to the fight.
COP To pull the cops off their friends.
COP Danny HANGS BACK, snapping PHOTOS of the event.
COP Scott SHOVES his way past the cops.
COP A COP BRINGS HIS NIGHT STICK down hard on SCOTT'S HEAD.
Scott sits on the toilet.
Harvey rinses blood from a white washcloth and goes back to cleaning Scott's HEAD WOUND.
HARVEY MILK ...if we had someone in the government who saw things the way we see them, the way the black community has black leaders who look out for their interests--
SCOTT SMITH You're gonna run for Supervisor, is that the idea?
I could go right for mayor, but I think I should work my way up to it...
You'll be my campaign manager.
Because I have so much experience in politics.
HARVEY MILK Politics is theater.
HARVEY MILK It doesn't matter if you win.
HARVEY MILK You make a statement.
HARVEY MILK You say, "I'm here, pay attention to me."
SCOTT SMITH Harvey, you do that every time you cross the street.
HARVEY MILK Coors looks like it might cave.
HARVEY MILK The union boys will owe me.
HARVEY MILK Imagine if we get their vote...
HARVEY MILK It'll be fun!
SCOTT SMITH Fun?
SCOTT SMITH Harvey starts kissing him all over.
HARVEY MILK We'll make it a spectacle.
Harvey walks down to Market St.
with a box.
He waves, shakes, flirts with everyone.
His warmest hello is from a gruff UNION MAN.
Behind Harvey, Scott pushes a loaded shopping cart.
Harvey sets his box down right beside a SFPD OFFICER.
It reads, a??Soap Box.a?? Harvey steps onto it.
A crowd forms.
HARVEY MILK A week ago, Police officers came into our area with covered up badges and sent fourteen of our people to the hospitals, and to jail.
HARVEY MILK The charges, "Blocking a Sidewalk."
HARVEY MILK Like a round girl at a boxing match, Scott parades around a blown up PHOTO from his shopping cart: TWO SF COPS DRAGGING
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) --Let us have our tax money go for our protection and not our persecution.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Worry about gun control and not marijuana control.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) School supplies, seniors, not what books I read-- Scott displays an old "Muscle Boys" magazine.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Harvey does a well timed take.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) A few hoots from the eclectic crowd.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) My fellow degenerates, I would like to announce my candidacy for San Francisco City Supervisor!
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Scott unfurls three hand made "MILK FOR CITY SUPERVISOR" banners that lap over the sides of the shopping cart.
WE SEE SCOTT, DANNY, JIM handing out FLYERS to a variety of SF CITIZENS: gay boys, older people, Chinese people, scared straight people, heckling high school boys.
Harvey EAGERLY APPROACHES anyone and everyone, shaking hands if they'll let him, reaching out to old people, straight people, gay people, even buttoned down BUSINESSMEN who cross the street to try to get away from him.
Harvey hands out campaign literature to a PASSERSBY.
HARVEY MILK Public dental care for retired people...
HARVEY MILK Legalize pot, vote Milk.
HARVEY MILK Harvey is distracted.
HARVEY MILK A young, long haired CLEVE JONES
passes.
At 18, he looks 15.
Harvey tries for his attention:
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Hey, I like the way your pants fit...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Where are you from, kid?
Sorry old man, not interested.
HARVEY MILK Where's home?
CLEVE JONES Phoenix.
HARVEY MILK I'm Harvey Milk.
HARVEY MILK I'm running for Supervisor.
HARVEY MILK What's your name?
CLEVE JONES Cleve...
CLEVE JONES Jones.
HARVEY MILK Well Mr. Jones, we should walk up to my camera shop and register you.
CLEVE JONES Fuck that.
CLEVE JONES Elections of any kind are a bourgeois affectation.
HARVEY MILK Is that right?
HARVEY MILK Do you trick up on Polk Street?
CLEVE JONES If I need the cash...
CLEVE JONES But I'm selective about my clients.
HARVEY MILK Tell me one thing before you get back to work then.
HARVEY MILK What was it like to be a little queer in Phoenix?
CLEVE JONES I faked a lung disease to get out of PE.
CLEVE JONES So what?
CLEVE JONES What are you, some kind of street shrink?
HARVEY MILK Sometimes.
HARVEY MILK But what I'm saying is, Phoenix can change.
HARVEY MILK But we have to start with our street: rent control, police abuse, pot, parks, seniors.
CLEVE JONES Well, good luck with all that.
HARVEY MILK You know what I think, Cleve Jones?
CLEVE JONES That you're gonna get somewhere if you keep talking?
HARVEY MILK No.
HARVEY MILK That you need to do what you're good at.
HARVEY MILK Be a prick.
HARVEY MILK Fight City Hall.
HARVEY MILK Fight the cops.
HARVEY MILK Fight the people who made you come here to do what you do.
CLEVE JONES Sorry old man, I'm leaving for Spain tomorrow.
CLEVE JONES Europe.
CLEVE JONES Got all the cash I need in my back pocket.
CLEVE JONES A GROUP OF CLEVE'S FRIENDS shout at him to join them.
CLEVE JONES Harvey watches him dart across the street to his friends.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) I didn't come out until very late in life.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) There was nobody to--
HARVEY MILK --look up to, no hope for a better life.
HARVEY MILK Those that did were outcast...
HARVEY MILK arrested..
HARVEY MILK suicide.
HARVEY MILK And the young ones, who did escape home...
HARVEY MILK and who arrive in San Francisco, and then what...
ANGLE ON: PARAMEDICS placing a BLOODY VICTIM into a BODY BAG.
COP The a??fruita?? was walking home with his a??tricka?? when they were jumped.
COP REVEAL: Harvey picks a blood stained whistle up off the street, the man's last attempt to call for help.
Name's Robert Hillsborough.
Did you know him?
HARVEY MILK He used to come into my shop.
HARVEY MILK Are there any witnesses?
COP Just the "trick."
COP Jerry Taylor.
HARVEY MILK Jerry wasn't a trick.
HARVEY MILK They were lovers.
COP Call it what you will.
COP He's our only witness and he says he can't identify the attackers.
HARVEY MILK There'd be a dozen witnesses if they thought you boys had any real interest in keeping them safe.
COP You're the Mayor of Castro Street now, right Harvey?
COP You really wanna help?
COP Get your people to show some discretion on the streets, huh?
COP HARVEY'S POV: The PARAMEDICS pull up the zipper on the body bag.
COP We follow the zipper past the victim's bloody hands, his torso, his face.
TO HAND DURING THE FOLLOWING POLITICAL MEETING.
(We catch a glimpse of the PHOTOS and see naked skin).
JIM RIVALDO Well, it looks like the big guns and the rich gays in San Francisco are going to back Dianne Feinstein and other straight candidates they consider "gay-friendly."
SCOTT SMITH Who cares about those old queens?
SCOTT SMITH Scott is laying down on THE BIG RED COUCH.
HARVEY MILK Why isn't my campaign manager leading the meeting?
SCOTT SMITH I'm beat, Harvey.
SCOTT SMITH I passed out flyers for seven hours straight.
HARVEY MILK In the bathhouse?
SCOTT SMITH People in bathhouses vote.
SCOTT SMITH I'm tired.
SCOTT SMITH I'm taking a nap.
SCOTT SMITH Scott heads up the stairs to their apartment.
SCOTT SMITH A CUSTOMER comes in.
SCOTT SMITH Danny quickly gathers the REVEALING PHOTOS and puts them back in the envelope.
HARVEY MILK Just checking the exposure.
HARVEY MILK That a new boyfriend?
HARVEY MILK He's very cute.
Um...
Thanks, Harvey.
HARVEY MILK So who are these so-called "gay leaders?" And who appointed them?
HARVEY MILK And what are you suggesting, Jim, that I'm supposed to go and solicit their endorsement?
HARVEY MILK PAST HARVEY WE SEE A GRANDMOTHERLY VOLUNTEER, THELMA, opening the mail, casually reading a letter, then rising and approaching Harvey.
HARVEY MILK We're down here, on the streets, trying to help people, so where they hell are they?
DICK PABICH David Goodstein is the publisher of The Advocate and he has a house--
JIM RIVALDO A mansion--
DICK PABICH --in Atherton.
THELMA Harvey, you should read this.
THELMA CLOSE ON THE LETTER as it goes from Thelma to Harvey.
Scott reads the LETTER.
Harvey sits VERY STILL.
SCOTT SMITH "Harvey Milk will have a dream journey and nightmare to hell, a night of horror.
SCOTT SMITH You will be stabbed and have your genitals, cock, balls, prick cut off."
I'm calling the police.
HARVEY MILK They probably wrote it.
HARVEY MILK Hey, If somebody tries to kill me, I'll get the sympathy vote, right?
HARVEY MILK Could be just the push we need.
SCOTT SMITH You think this is funny?
SCOTT SMITH Look at it.
SCOTT SMITH Reluctantly, Harvey takes the letter from Scott.
HARVEY MILK It's a complete joke.
HARVEY MILK No rhythm.
HARVEY MILK No humor.
HARVEY MILK It's insulting.
HARVEY MILK CLOSE ON THE LETTER: Someone has drawn a STICK FIGURE of Harvey being tortured - bullets, knives, fire, etc.
HARVEY MILK Harvey makes a DECISION: He sticks the DRAWING to the refrigerator, the first thing he'll see in the morning.
SCOTT SMITH Don't do that.
HARVEY MILK If you put it away, hide it in a drawer, it'll just get bigger and scarier.
HARVEY MILK Now it's there.
HARVEY MILK We'll see it every day.
HARVEY MILK It can't get us.
SCOTT SMITH All this energy...
SCOTT SMITH to make yourself a target.
SCOTT SMITH And what for?
SCOTT SMITH Something we have no chance to win.
SCOTT SMITH Harvey wraps his arms around him.
HARVEY MILK I keep telling you, it's not just about winning.
Harvey, in his work boots and jeans, watches as a LARGE GATE SLIDES OPEN allowing his entry.
Scott, even scruffier looking than Harvey, stands next to him.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) The "top gays" in San Francisco were David Goodstein and his lawyer sidekick Rick Stokes.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) David was a
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) rich old queen who'd bought the biggest gay magazine, The Advocate.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) He had it delivered to subscribers in brown paper bags so no-one would know...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) That's how he lived his life, covered up, discreet.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Harvey and Scott are shown to the pool area by a HOUSE BOY.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Statues and potted plants and expensive marble.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Everything shouts "GOOD TASTE!" Scott strips off his clothes and DIVES INTO THE POOL.
Harvey has lunch with the "gay establishment": DAVID GOODSTEIN, 58, gold and turquoise jewelry, and Goodstein's protA(C)gA(C), RICK STOKES, 45, reserved.
Rick can't keep his eyes off naked Scott in the pool.
DAVID GOODSTEIN I worked for a financial institution.
DAVID GOODSTEIN I was very discreet.
DAVID GOODSTEIN But someone spotted me at the opera, sitting in a box, next to my lover.
DAVID GOODSTEIN And I was fired.
DAVID GOODSTEIN That's when I decided to do something.
DAVID GOODSTEIN So I bought The Advocate.
DAVID GOODSTEIN And I use my money and my influence in quiet ways, to do what I can...
HARVEY MILK Endorsing straight candidates is what you think is best to help us?
DAVID GOODSTEIN Yes, if they're friendly to our cause.
Politics is complicated in San Francisco, and Supervisor is a citywide office.
Political alliances need to be built.
You can't simply move here from across the country and run for office.
HARVEY MILK But I am running for office.
HARVEY MILK I'm on the ballot.
HARVEY MILK I have the union rank and file, the seniors, and I could use your magazine's endorsement.
DAVID GOODSTEIN Harvey, we're like the Catholic church.
DAVID GOODSTEIN We welcome converts, but we don't make them Pope the same day.
HARVEY MILK And why haven't you run?
DAVID GOODSTEIN It's too early for a gay candidate for Supervisor.
DAVID GOODSTEIN Especially one from the Castro.
DAVID GOODSTEIN It's bad for the community's image.
DAVID GOODSTEIN Scott climbs out of the pool and sits at the table, naked and sopping wet.
SCOTT SMITH What's wrong with the Castro?
DAVID GOODSTEIN Nobody works there.
DAVID GOODSTEIN It's all sex and drugs and more sex and no one taking responsibility for their own problems.
HARVEY MILK The cops come into our neighborhood and beat us.
HARVEY MILK They turn a blind eye if one of us is murdered.
RICK STOKES Then we file a lawsuit against the city.
RICK STOKES We go to our political allies in City Hall...
HARVEY MILK There are no real gay allies.
HARVEY MILK Yes, our friends may sense our struggle, but they can't feel it.
HARVEY MILK It's not life or death for them.
HARVEY MILK We need our own in office.
RICK STOKES You can't demand acceptance overnight.
HARVEY MILK Why not?
HARVEY MILK How can we ask them to respect us if we don't show ourselves some self respect, David.
DAVID GOODSTEIN The more a??outa?? you make us, the more you incite them.
DAVID GOODSTEIN Step back and quiet down.
HARVEY MILK Go back into the closet?
HARVEY MILK Is that what you're saying?
HARVEY MILK Because I know the closet.
HARVEY MILK I lived in it for more years than I care to remember.
HARVEY MILK I don't need your endorsement.
HARVEY MILK I'm not asking anyone for acceptance.
HARVEY MILK I don't have time to ask.
DAVID GOODSTEIN For you, politics is a game, a lark.
DAVID GOODSTEIN Like putting on a rock festival or staging a "love-in."
DAVID GOODSTEIN You're too old to be a hippie, Harvey Milk!
DAVID GOODSTEIN Harvey turns around, ready for a fight.
HARVEY MILK I'm not a candidate, I'm part of a movement.
HARVEY MILK The movement is the candidate.
HARVEY MILK There's a difference.
HARVEY MILK You don't see the difference.
HARVEY MILK But I do.
SCOTT SMITH Thanks for the swim.
SCOTT SMITH I'm sorry I pissed in your pool.
A SLOW MOTION MONTAGE OF: the citizens of the Castro are turning out to vote.
Young, old, gay, straight...
but a weight hangs over the day.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) When the vote came in on election day...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) out of 32 candidates vying for 6 seats...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) We came in 10th.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Just a handful short of being the first big eared, gay as a three- dollar-bill, cock sucker ever elected to public office.
HARVEY MILK So...
HARVEY MILK I went for it again in '75...
HARVEY MILK with just a few...
HARVEY MILK minor...
HARVEY MILK adjustments.
CLOSE ON: Harvey looking through a hole in the bottom of a pair of well worn wing-tips.
He tries them on anyhow.
JUMP TO: Harvey steps out of a dressing room in a brown suit.
His hair is cut short, his face is shaven clean.
It's quite a transformation.
Scott and the old owner, LILY, size him up.
SCOTT SMITH No.
SCOTT SMITH Not cute.
SCOTT SMITH The shoes are hideous and I hate your hair.
SCOTT SMITH You're not fooling anybody.
HARVEY MILK I'm not gonna let the Pacific Heights biddies write me off again because of a ponytail.
HARVEY MILK I like it.
HARVEY MILK Scott is horrified.
HARVEY MILK Harvey pulls a pair of movie ticket stubs from its inner pocket.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Cabaret?
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) For two?
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Lily, is this from one of my kind?
No, no.
You won't run into the owner.
He died in that suit.
SCOTT SMITH This isn't sexy, Harvey.
Harvey grabs Scott, kisses him.
Then playful:
HARVEY MILK Too bad.
HARVEY MILK No more pot, no more bath houses for me and little poo.
MONTAGE: More ACTIVITY inside and outside the shop.
More VOLUNTEERS.
The printing press burns through flyers.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) We ran and we lost the Supervisors race a second time in '75, but with
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) more votes than ever.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) So in 1976, against everyone's advice, I really pissed off the Democratic political power houses, because I ran against "their boy"--
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) --Art Agnos, a part of their "Political Machine."
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) And this time we weren't running for City Supervisor.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) This time it was bigger, California State Assembly.
It's a firestorm of words as Harvey debates Art Agnos.
HARVEY MILK It's a racket.
HARVEY MILK It's 1976 and you still have to be straight, white, Catholic and male to get into the San Francisco police force.
HARVEY MILK It's Racist.
HARVEY MILK Homophobic.
ART AGNOS How many people do you consider enemies, Harvey?
ART AGNOS I've counted five already.
ART AGNOS Art smiles.
ART AGNOS Chuckles flutter through the audience.
HARVEY MILK You're right, Art.
HARVEY MILK And many are your closest friends.
HARVEY MILK You see, I don't think State Assembly seats should be awarded on the basis of service to the Democrat Machine.
HARVEY MILK Machines operate on oil and grease.
HARVEY MILK They're dirty, dehumanizing, and too often unresponsive to any needs but those of the operator.
ART AGNOS Mr. Milk, I've worked for years as a social worker in this city.
ART AGNOS I know Sacramento.
ART AGNOS I know how to get done what we all need done there.
HARVEY MILK Tell me Mr. Agnos...
HARVEY MILK right here in the Castro, Robert Hillsbourough was murdered for walking home with his long time partner.
HARVEY MILK Stabbed,
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) fifteen times.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) The last words he heard were "Faggot, Faggot, Faggot..."
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) And you say you're outraged, but why won't your liberal establishment return our calls?
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Why won't they bring these murderers to justice?
Art Agnos puts his arm around Harvey as they walk out.
ART AGNOS You know Harv', your whole rap's a real downer.
HARVEY MILK My God, you're handsome up close.
HARVEY MILK I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to licking you...
HARVEY MILK in the polls.
You talk a lot about what you're against.
What are you for?
In this town, you gotta give em' a reason for optimism or you're cooked.
Art gets into his car and goes.
Harvey has no car.
He stops and PONDERS ART'S WORDS...
They stick with him.
Scott tries to make a simple meal of pasta, struggling to operate in the kitchen that is filled with Harvey's POLITICAL ENTOURAGE and VOLUNTEERS.
He finds Harvey, Jim, and Dick having an impromptu strategy meeting in the adjoining bedroom.
SCOTT SMITH Harvey.
SCOTT SMITH Dinner.
HARVEY ...
HARVEY get some union boys in the audience, they love me...
JIM RIVALDO I can't control who's in the audience...
SCOTT SMITH Harvey, you need to eat something.
SCOTT SMITH Now.
Scott steps back into the kitchen.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) Ladies and Gentlemen.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) Our apartment is officially off limits.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) CHASES the VOLUNTEERS out of the kitchen, out of his bedroom...
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) down the stairs...
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) Downstairs.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) Time to go.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) Go.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) OUT!
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) Harvey emerges, about to intervene.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) Don't say anything.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) For once, Harvey keeps his mouth shut.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) Jim and Dick sneak past Scott, sheepishly.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) When Scott and Harvey are alone...
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) Sit down and eat.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) Harvey and Scott eat dinner in tense silence.
If you say one thing about politics or your campaign or where you're speaking tonight or whose endorsement you need...
I'll stab you with my fork I swear to God.
HARVEY I just wanted to say...
HARVEY This is the most delicious meal I've ever eaten in my entire life.
HARVEY Harvey gives a warm smile.
HARVEY Scott gives a laugh, but he looks like he's about to lose it.
HARVEY MILK If we lose this one, it'll be just me and you again.
HARVEY MILK I promise.
HARVEY MILK Scott nods.
HARVEY MILK That's exactly what he needed to hear.
Harvey walks Castro's streets alone, toward his apartment.
A CAR PULLS UP BEHIND HARVEY.
A MAN jumps out of the car, and the driver speeds around the block.
Harvey turns a corner.
The man follows.
Harvey picks up his pace.
He searches his pockets for a whistle, a weapon, and beelines it to his shop, his nerves are failing him.
He gets to the doorway of his camera store, and runs face first into: CLEVE JONES.
He's not the feisty young kid he met on the street earlier.
He's been sitting on Harvey's steps, waiting with wet eyes.
HARVEY MILK Phoenix?
HARVEY MILK We should go inside.
HARVEY MILK They do.
HARVEY MILK Harvey locks the door behind them.
Harvey pours two cups of coffee, and delivers one to Cleve who is pulled away on the big red couch.
CLEVE JONES You staying up with me?
HARVEY MILK The election's tomorrow.
HARVEY MILK I won't sleep...
HARVEY MILK Was he good looking?
CLEVE JONES No.
CLEVE JONES He was hideous.
HARVEY MILK Hard to tell what's worse.
HARVEY MILK With me, my boyfriends usually find better looking ones to cheat with.
CLEVE JONES I thought we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
HARVEY MILK Guess what, Cleve Jones.
CLEVE JONES What?
HARVEY MILK You're going to meet the most extraordinary men, the sexiest, brightest, funniest men, and you're going to fall in love with so many of them, and you won't know until
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) the end of your life who your greatest friends were or your greatest love was.
CLEVE JONES Is that supposed to help?
HARVEY MILK Maybe a little.
HARVEY MILK Or not.
CLEVE JONES I went to Spain last month...
CLEVE JONES long story.
CLEVE JONES In Barcelona, there was this memorial march for gay people who died under Franco.
CLEVE JONES The police tried to break it up.
CLEVE JONES It started a riot.
CLEVE JONES A bullet ripped through a drag queens scalp, his wig flew off, but he kept fighting.
CLEVE JONES There was blood literally running in the gutter.
HARVEY MILK We could have a revolution here too.
HARVEY MILK But you can't just use the Castro to cruise.
HARVEY MILK You gotta fight.
CLEVE JONES You think you'll win?
HARVEY MILK Winning isn't my strong suit.
Well, I don't "do" losing.
Ever.
Maybe I should run for office, and you can work for me.
If you can do it, I can do it.
HARVEY MILK Can you assemble a thousand people in an hour?
CLEVE JONES Yeah, sure.
HARVEY MILK All right, if I run again, you're my man.
CLEVE JONES If...?
HARVEY MILK Polls open in 3 hours.
HARVEY MILK Lets hit the bus stops.
Harvey is on the back of a motorcycle.
The driver heads up Market Street.
Folks stand in voting lines, flags outside of polling places.
City Hall's tall dome grows nearer.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) And we lost that Assembly Race too, which made me a bona fide three- time, political loser.
CLOSE ON THE TV SET PLAYING A 1970's ORANGE JUICE COMMERCIAL featuring runner up to Miss America, ANITA BRYANT.
"Come to the Florida sunshine tree, great tasting orange juice naturally, orange juice with lots of vitamin c, from the Florida sunshine tree."
Harvey is alone in the shop, surrounded by remnants of a celebration party that never happened.
Jim Rivaldo lets himself into the store.
Jim has his maps rolled up under his arm.
JIM RIVALDO We lost, but we lost by less!
JIM RIVALDO More votes than ever...
JIM RIVALDO I remember when that used to work.
JIM RIVALDO I want to show you something.
JIM RIVALDO This is remarkable.
JIM RIVALDO Jim starts laying out his trusty MAPS, color coded with precinct results from that night.
JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D) The red is where you did best tonight.
JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D) If we can get the initiative on district elections to pass, and we can -- we can -- our new Supervisor's District will go right up Market.
JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D) Right around the Castro.
The district Jim outlines is ALL BRIGHT RED.
JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D) If you run for Supervisor with this new district, it's a potential landslide.
JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D) You'll be the first up- front gay man elected to major office in the U.S.
HARVEY MILK I don't know if I have another one in me.
HARVEY MILK Or Scott.
HARVEY MILK But Harvey's gaze deceives his words.
HARVEY MILK HOLD ON HARVEY - contemplating a FOURTH run for office.

Harvey's PHONE RINGS.
He snatches it up.
HARVEY MILK Scottie?
BOY'S VOICE I'm sorry sir.
BOY'S VOICE I um...
BOY'S VOICE I read about you in the paper.
HARVEY MILK I'm sorry.
HARVEY MILK I can't talk right--
BOY'S VOICE Sir, I think I want to kill myself.
HARVEY MILK No.
HARVEY MILK You don't want to do that.
Where do you live?
BOY'S VOICE In Minnesota.
HARVEY MILK You saw me in a paper in Minnesota?
HARVEY MILK How'd I look?
BOY'S VOICE My folks are taking me to this place tomorrow.
BOY'S VOICE A hospital.
BOY'S VOICE To fix me.
HARVEY MILK There's nothing wrong with you.
HARVEY MILK Listen to me.
HARVEY MILK You don't have to hurt yourself, okay?
HARVEY MILK Are you there?
HARVEY MILK Here's what you have to do.
HARVEY MILK Are you listening?
BOY'S VOICE Yes.
HARVEY MILK Get on a bus.
HARVEY MILK Go to the next biggest city.
HARVEY MILK New York, San Francisco, LA, or even Minneapolis.
HARVEY MILK It doesn't matter.
HARVEY MILK Just leave.
HARVEY MILK You won't be alone.
HARVEY MILK There are people out here just like you who will welcome you and love you.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) You're not sick.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) You're not wrong.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) God does not hate you.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Just leave.
BOY'S VOICE I can't.
HARVEY MILK Yes.
HARVEY MILK You can.
HARVEY MILK Just get on a bus.
BOY'S VOICE I can't...
BOY'S VOICE I can't walk, sir.
BOY'S VOICE I'm in a wheelchair...
BOY'S VOICE Sir.
BOY'S VOICE Are you there?
BOY'S VOICE Harvey FORCES HIMSELF TO SOUND CALM...
HARVEY MILK That's okay.
HARVEY MILK It's going to be okay.
HARVEY MILK Over the phone, Harvey hears the SOUND OF AN ADULT VOICE, someone finding the BOY on the phone, then...
HARVEY MILK The LINE goes DEAD.
HARVEY MILK It's all too much for Harvey.
HARVEY MILK There's nothing a speech or a pep talk can do to fix this.
HARVEY MILK Harvey is overwhelmed.
HARVEY MILK Dick comes upstairs.
DICK PABICH Harvey, you better come down.
DICK PABICH There's gonna be a riot.
DICK PABICH Moving in a daze, stunned by the call, Harvey digs out A BULLHORN and heads out.
From inside, SCOTT WATCHES HIS LOVER JUMPING BACK IN THE FREY.
A weight hangs.
He doesn't follow...
Cleve RUSHES into the bar (ON FIRE WITH RIGHTEOUS FURY) and BLOWS A POLICE WHISTLE to get everyone's attention.
CLEVE JONES Out of the bar and into the streets!
CLEVE JONES Anita Bryant is coming after you!
Angry young men mill around the streets, their rage building.
Someone TOSSES a trash can and it ROLLS.
A POLICEMAN in riot gear comes up to Harvey.
POLICEMAN If you can't control em', we will.
HARVEY MILK Give me permission to march them.
POLICEMAN Where?
HARVEY MILK Anywhere.
Surrounded by the massive crowd, HARVEY CLIMBS THE LARGE BOX that covers the subway construction at Market and Castro.
It's a stage of sorts.
Harvey lifts his bullhorn to his lips.
HARVEY MILK I know you are angry.
HARVEY MILK I am angry.
HARVEY MILK Follow me through the streets of San Francisco to share our anger!
HARVEY MILK Harvey jumps down and begins walking, not sure if the mob will follow.
HARVEY MILK Finally, they do.
HARVEY MILK Cleve catches up.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Are they following in back?
CLEVE JONES Yes.
CLEVE JONES Where are we going?
HARVEY MILK I don't know.
HARVEY MILK We have to keep them moving.
HARVEY MILK Exhaust them.
HARVEY MILK March them till they drop.
HARVEY MILK We can't have a riot tonight.
HARVEY MILK Harvey LIFTS THE BULLHORN.
HARVEY MILK He starts a marching chant.
HARVEY MILK The crowd starts following along.
HARVEY MILK JUMP TO: Gays glare at cops.
HARVEY MILK Cops beat their nightsticks against their chests and power poles.
HARVEY MILK Anger burns as Harvey marches the mob toward City Hall.
HARVEY MILK Dick and Jim catch up.
DICK PABICH They're still too hot in back.
DICK PABICH They'll burn the joint down.
HARVEY MILK Help me turn them up Van Ness.
HARVEY MILK We'll go all the way to Broadway.
Dick heads back to try and wrangle the crowd.
Harvey continues marching.
Harvey arrives, the crowd still hot.
Cops beat their nightsticks against their shields.
Some jab protesters, trying to incite a fight.
Anger burns.
Harvey climbs the steps, his stage.
He lifts his bullhorn.
HARVEY MILK My name is Harvey Milk...
HARVEY MILK And I want to recruit you.
HARVEY MILK The CROWD ROARS APPROVAL.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I am here tonight to say, we will no longer sit quietly in our closets.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) We must fight.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Not just in the Castro, or San Francisco, but everywhere the Anitas go.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Anita Bryant did not win tonight.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Anita Bryant has brought us together...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) She is going to create a national gay force!
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) And the young people in Richmond, Minnesota, or Jackson, Mississippi, or Woodmere, New York...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Who are coming out and hearing Anita Bryant on television telling them that they're wrong, they're sick, that there is no place for them in this great country, in this world...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) They're looking to us for something tonight...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) And I say, we have to give them hope!
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) The CROWD goes WILD.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) HARVEY'S SPEECH CROSSES THE CUT TO...
Harvey speaks to the "PARENT-TEACHERS UNITED FOR BETTER SCHOOLS" group.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) --Hope for a better world...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Hope for a better tomorrow...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Hope for a
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great...
Harvey speaks to a hall filled with TEAMSTERS.
HARVEY MILK Hope for the worker who awakens from the American dream to find that all the jobs have left the country...
HARVEY MILK We gotta give em' HOPE!
HARVEY MILK PAN FACES OF TEAMSTERS - Several MINORITY FACES.
HARVEY MILK CLOSE ON
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) When San Francisco changed the voting rules--
Harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder...
HARVEY MILK --they allowed people to elect Supervisors directly from their own neighborhoods.
HARVEY MILK A black neighborhood could elect an African- American.
HARVEY MILK Chinatown could elect a Chinese Supervisor...
HARVEY MILK And the Castro could choose me or Rick Stokes.
HARVEY MILK But decent art begs for balance, right?
HARVEY MILK So little district 8, two miles south of The Castro--
CAMERA MOVES ALONG THE STREET catching glimpses of churches, shops and tidy houses.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) --promised to stay the same as ever.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Conservative, Irish, Catholic and with just the right touch of poetry, they found themselves a handsome ex-cop.
DAN WHITE holds a small press conference.
His words are fiery, but his delivery and stage presence are lacking.
DAN WHITE I'm not going to be forced out of San Francisco by splinter groups of social radicals, social deviants, and incorrigibles.
DAN WHITE You must realize there are thousands upon thousands of frustrated, angry people such as yourselves waiting to unleash a fury that will eradicate the malignancies which blight our beautiful city.
Harvey's suit is laid out.
A record turns.
Wagner blasts from the windows.
Scott is folding his clothes into a box.
HARVEY MILK Evelyn Lear's in town, at the Opera house in Tannhauser.
SCOTT SMITH Clearly.
HARVEY MILK What if she strolls into the Castro for a cocktail?
HARVEY MILK Just one more.
HARVEY MILK We can't let Rick Stokes take it.
SCOTT SMITH Let Rick have it.
SCOTT SMITH Nobody thinks you're a fraud here, Harvey.
SCOTT SMITH You're not in New York, you're not a closet case asshole anymore.
SCOTT SMITH People respect you here.
SCOTT SMITH Relax for a year.
SCOTT SMITH Get us back on our feet.
HARVEY MILK If people are ever going to take me seriously, I have to win this one.
SCOTT SMITH Since when did you care if anyone took you seriously?
HARVEY MILK Anita wants to put us all back in concentration camps.
HARVEY MILK Rick Stokes is too weak to beat her back if she gets to California.
HARVEY MILK I have to be in office to protect us from them.
SCOTT SMITH I can't do another one.
SCOTT SMITH I'll be back for my sheets.
SCOTT SMITH If you're not here, I'll see you in the shop next week.
SCOTT SMITH Scott picks up his box of clothes and starts out of the
apartment.
Harvey, not meaning a word:
HARVEY MILK If you leave me right now...
HARVEY MILK I can find someone new.
SCOTT SMITH I know.
SCOTT SMITH You're a catch.
SCOTT SMITH Scott leaves.
SCOTT SMITH Harvey is in shock, unable to comprehend the loss.
SCOTT SMITH Unable/unwilling to reverse the choice he's made.
The ENTOURAGE is completely caught up in the new campaign (Cleve, Jim, Dick, and newcomer MICHAEL WONG, 23, asexual and devoutly political).
Harvey is RANTING, ripping down an Assembly campaign poster.
HARVEY MILK --Ring out the old, ring in the new.
HARVEY MILK This is over.
HARVEY MILK Done.
HARVEY MILK I don't want to see anything that say's fucking Assembly.
HARVEY MILK This three-time loser faggot is running for Supervisor goddamn it!
HARVEY MILK ANNE KRONENBERG, 23, parks her motorcycle outside, WALKS INTO THE CAMERA SHOP, and plants herself behind HARVEY'S DESK.
HARVEY MILK Cleve, Mike, Jim and Dick are STARING at Anne.
JIM RIVALDO Who the heck is she?
HARVEY MILK Our new campaign manager.
HARVEY MILK She called last week to volunteer and I asked her to help.
DICK PABICH Help or take over?
DICK PABICH What about Scott?
HARVEY MILK We need new blood.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Guys...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Anne Kronenberg.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) She's a woman...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) A woman who likes women.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Odd, isn't it?
ANNE KRONENBERG Hi guys.
ANNE KRONENBERG Mr. Milk...
ANNE KRONENBERG Rick Stokes isn't pulling out.
ANNE KRONENBERG He's officially filed to run against you.
ANNE KRONENBERG My friend at The Advocate says David Goodstein is backing him.
MICHAEL WONG A gay candidate against a gay candidate.
MICHAEL WONG It's unfortunate.
JIM RIVALDO They'll split the gay vote.
JIM RIVALDO The straights will divide and conquer.
HARVEY MILK Try to find out when they're going to announce.
DICK PABICH You replaced Scott with a lesbian?
HARVEY MILK Anne worked on a recycling campaign up North.
HARVEY MILK She's very organized.
JIM RIVALDO How do you know she's not a plant from Rick Stokes' campaign?
ANNE KRONENBERG Are you guys always this paranoid?
MICHAEL WONG Yes.
MICHAEL WONG They take after Harvey.
HARVEY MILK Shouldn't you be doing someone's laundry?
MICHAEL WONG Right after you redecorate my house.
ANNE KRONENBERG Sir, my girlfriends say you guys don't like women.
ANNE KRONENBERG Just asking, is there a place for us in all this, or are you scared of girls?
HARVEY MILK Gentleman, we already have a tinker bell, a lotus-blossom, Jim and Dick in your three-piece suits.
HARVEY MILK We need someone to manage things.
HARVEY MILK A woman this time.
HARVEY MILK She's the right price, and she has bigger balls than any of you.
ANNE KRONENBERG Just give me whatever's left over in the register at the end of the day.
ANNE KRONENBERG So should I call the Chronicle about getting US an endorsement?
ANNE KRONENBERG No?
ANNE KRONENBERG OFF the group of misfits, considering the addition.
PAN OFF: a large "RICK STOKES, SUPERVISOR DISTRICT 5" poster to reveal Anne Kronenberg outside the hall handing "MILK" signs to a long line of gathering women and lesbians who are filing in.
Flanked by a PEEVED AID, Rick Stokes rushes out of the lecture hall and confronts Anne.
RICK STOKES Young lady, you must be confused.
RICK STOKES This is my night, not Mr. Milk's.
ANNE KRONENBERG No, sir.
ANNE KRONENBERG I'm Harvey's new campaign manager.
ANNE KRONENBERG Anne Kronenberg.
RICK STOKES Then you should know this race is for District 5, the Castro, not for all of your lesbian...
RICK STOKES compadres-- A tough lesbian kisses Anne and stares Rick down as she heads in.
RICK STOKES Rick looks uncomfortable around all these women.
ANNE KRONENBERG I'm sorry.
ANNE KRONENBERG Are we distracting you, Mr. Stokes?
ANNE KRONENBERG I'd hate to screw you up on your big night.
ANNE KRONENBERG Dick runs up looking for more fliers.
ANNE KRONENBERG Taking Rick even more off his game, Dick is flirtatious.
DICK PABICH Hi Rick, handsome suit.
DICK PABICH Annie, do you have any more hand cards?
RICK STOKES These people are not from this area.
RICK STOKES They need to leave.
RICK STOKES Now.
DICK PABICH Not true.
DICK PABICH Guess where we found them all, Rick?
DICK PABICH A slew of them.
DICK PABICH Way up on Valencia Street.
DICK PABICH Living right there in our district.
DICK PABICH And you see, as it turns out, Annie here is very, very popular with the ladies.
DICK PABICH Dick puts his arm around Anne.
DICK PABICH Rick is stupefied.
Dozens of supporters hold "MILK for Supervisor" signs in a long line along Market St.
waving to commuters.
Anne walks the long line, handing out new signs to arriving volunteers.
Harvey is handing out FLYERS.
He is exhausted, his throat is RAW.
The campaign is nearly over.
A WEIRD MOMENT: A BOY walks up to Harvey and hands him a flier.
ALL SOUND GOES DEAD ON THE SOUNDTRACK as HARVEY'S EYES lock into the BOY'S EYES.
Harvey reads the FLIER: a??Unite and Fight for Dan White.a?? Harvey looks back to pat the BOY'S head, but he's gone.
He looks to the sidewalk for the kid...
a parent...
nothing...
Harvey is still looking at the flier.
Anne is leaving with a stack of SF Chronicles.
Cleve comes in, pulls one off her stack, and looks for "the article."
HARVEY MILK They've accused me of many things, but never as blatant a lie as this.
ANNE KRONENBERG First ever newspaper endorsement.
CLEVE JONES They endorsed you for being a good businessman?
CLEVE JONES Has Scott read this?
CLEVE JONES He'll piss himself.
HARVEY MILK Yeah?
HARVEY MILK Go show him.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Cleve, maybe you should go find a boy to celebrate with.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Just in case.
CLEVE JONES I'm going to The Stud.
CLEVE JONES Meet me out.
CLEVE JONES Cleve goes.
CLEVE JONES His energy is boundless.
CLEVE JONES Harvey sits alone watching the bargoers return home through his front window.
bitter-sweetness lingers.
A couple waves, one shouts out:
Gonna win this time, Milk?
They walk on, not waiting for an answer.
Then, a drunk, cute, Latino, JACK LIRA, 25, stops.
He stares in at the political ads in the window.
Harvey watches him sway drunk out of his mind, waiting for him to fall.
The two make eye contact.
Harvey smiles.
Jack tries to.
Harvey picks up a folding chair and walks it out to him.
JACK LIRA You're more handsome in the posters.
HARVEY MILK Thank you.
HARVEY MILK Where do you live?
JACK LIRA ...Palomino's are my favorite horse.
JACK LIRA They're smart.
JACK LIRA They're fast and compact.
JACK LIRA Do you think I'm more like a Palomino or a Stallion?
JACK LIRA Jack smiles, out of his mind.
JACK LIRA Then he sits/falls down into the chair, and slides off.
JACK LIRA Harvey stands above the passed out young man.
JACK LIRA A newcomer.
JACK LIRA A wounded bird.
JACK LIRA Perfect.
Completely nude, Jack plays a tantalizing game of seduction, allowing Harvey to hold him, then wriggling away...
Dancing against Harvey then BITING his shoulder...
LYING on the bed, then ROLLING away when Harvey tries to hold him...
No TALK.
No POLITICS.
Just SEX.
A perfect RELEASE for Harvey.
Harvey holds Jack after lovemaking.
JACK LIRA My father beat me when he found out...
JACK LIRA So I came here.
JACK LIRA I stay in this man's house.
JACK LIRA But I don't like him.
HARVEY Shh, it's okay, now.
HARVEY No one's ever going to beat you again.
HARVEY A long, comforting beat between them.
JACK LIRA I love you.
HARVEY Do you even remember my name?
HARVEY Harvey.
JACK LIRA I love you, Harvey.
HARVEY stands in a voting booth.
He goes down the list of names.
He finally punches the one next to "HARVEY MILK" District 5, and pulls the lever.
The chads fall.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) And for the first time in my life, it all came together...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) the union boys, the women, the seniors, the minorities...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) All of the us's showed up...
TV lights blast Castro Camera.
A raucous crowd pours into the streets to greet the roar of motorcycles.
Anne pulls up with the Sheriff on back.
Harvey is passenger on a second bike.
HARVEY IS VICTORIOUS!
He is instantly swarmed.
The Shop is packed.
It's a giant celebration party.
Anne and Cleve are working the door.
SCOTT SMITH WATCHES FROM THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE SHOP as Rick Stokes and David Goodstein try to get in.
RICK STOKES We just want to congratulate him.
CLEVE JONES I'm sorry.
CLEVE JONES We're all full.
DAVID GOODSTEIN Harvey!
DAVID GOODSTEIN Harvey!
HARVEY MILK It's too crowded.
HARVEY MILK Sorry!
HARVEY MILK JACK LIRA shoves his way toward the door...
JACK LIRA Harvey!
JACK LIRA Harvey PULLS JACK INSIDE, right past Goodstein and Stokes.
JACK LIRA Harvey CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF SCOTT OUTSIDE...
HARVEY MILK Scottie--?
HARVEY MILK But Scott fades into the CROWD.
HARVEY MILK Harvey (with Jack at his side) is pulled back into the party.
CLEVE JONES The new Mrs. Milk.
CLEVE JONES I give it a week.
JACK LIRA Harvey, is this all for you?
JACK LIRA Are you this famous?
HARVEY MILK No, darling.
HARVEY MILK We do this all the time.
HARVEY MILK Do you like it?
HARVEY MILK Jim is calling out NAMES of the OTHER WINNERS.
JIM RIVALDO Carol Ruth Silver...
JIM RIVALDO Gordon Lau...
JIM RIVALDO It's the most liberal Board in years!
HARVEY MILK What about Dan White?
HARVEY MILK Did he win?
We'll deal with him tomorrow.
Harvey is DOUSED with champagne.
JUMP TO: Harvey is interviewed by a TV REPORTER.
Jack squeezes his way under Harvey's arm and into the picture.
Does this mean, as many straights are concerned, maybe the gays are taking over San Francisco?
Are you going to be a Supervisor for all the people?
HARVEY MILK I have to be.
HARVEY MILK That's what I was elected for.
HARVEY MILK I have to be there to open up the dialogue for the sensitivities of all people, all their problems, the problems that effect this city effect all of us.
HARVEY MILK Thank you San Francisco!
HARVEY MILK Thank you!
SET TO MUSIC: In his old brown suit, Harvey walks to City Hall with a crowd of supporters.
The familiar faces now include Jack Lira.
On City Hall's steps, Mayor Moscone swears in HARVEY.
HARVEY MILK I, Harvey Milk, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter and during such time as I hold the office of Supervisor, City and County of San Francisco.
HARVEY MILK Bulbs FLASH.
HARVEY MILK A light rain begins to fall.
HARVEY MILK Umbrellas go up.
Anita Bryant said gay people brought the drought to California.
Looks to me like it's finally started raining!
Cheers.
Harvey is emboldened.
Off a TV in Scott's NEW APARTMENT, we see a S.F. Morning show featuring new Supervisors, Harvey Milk and Dan White.
This will be the first time in many years that we've seen so many new faces on the Board of Supervisors.
Do you think such diversity will cripple the Board?
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) The name of the game on the Board is six votes to get anything passed.
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) So, like it or not, Dan and I are now in bed together...
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) politically speaking.
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) THE CAMERA REVEALS SCOTT watching the program.
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) He's been up all night.
I've assured Harvey here that my brochure's comments about "social deviants" referred more to junkies than to his people.
See, I'm about to have my first child.
I have to make sure this city remains a decent place to raise him.
The segment over, sound assistants help Harvey and Dan remove their microphones.
Harvey tries to draw Dan in:
HARVEY MILK How long were you a fireman, Dan?
DAN WHITE A couple of years.
HARVEY MILK And before that...
HARVEY MILK You were a police officer?
HARVEY MILK Dan studies Harvey suspiciously...
HARVEY MILK What's his point?
DAN WHITE You have something against cops?
HARVEY MILK No.
HARVEY MILK They tend to have something against me.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) But firefighters.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Now those are true heroes...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) They supported me in the last campaign.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I support them fully.
DAN WHITE I appreciate it.
HARVEY MILK I meant what I said.
HARVEY MILK I'd like to work together.
HARVEY MILK Dan hesitantly accepts Harvey's handshake.
HARVEY MILK It's a step.
DAN WHITE I'll see you at the office, Mr.
DAN WHITE Milk.
Harvey goes through the metal detectors at the entrance and finds Cleve in a NEW SUIT waiting for the elevator.
HARVEY MILK What do you think of my new theater?
CLEVE JONES A bit over the top.
HARVEY MILK What's with the suit?
CLEVE JONES I got it from a friend.
CLEVE JONES Harvey leads Cleve from the elevator to the grand staircase.
HARVEY MILK When you come here, I want you to wear the tightest jeans possible.
HARVEY MILK Never blend in.
HARVEY MILK And no elevators.
HARVEY MILK Ever.
HARVEY MILK Always take the stairs, you can make such a grand entrance going up the stairs.
Harvey leads Cleve down the hall of Supervisors' offices, passing Dianne Feinstein's open door.
HARVEY MILK And street talk only around Feinstein.
HARVEY MILK Shit, goddamn, fuck,
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) all that.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) It bugs the hell out of her.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) They arrive at his Lead Aide's desk: it's Anne Kronenberg.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Morning Annie, let's set Cleve up on mail.
ANNE KRONENBERG Will do.
HARVEY MILK Come into my office...
Harvey walks in.
Michael and Jim are in a strategy session.
HARVEY MILK The first order of business that will come out of this office is a city wide Gay Rights Ordinance.
HARVEY MILK Just like the one Anita shot down in Dade County.
HARVEY MILK What do you think, Lotus Blossom?
MICHAEL WONG I think it's good.
MICHAEL WONG Not great.
HARVEY MILK Then make it brilliant.
HARVEY MILK I want Anita's attention here.
HARVEY MILK In San Francisco.
HARVEY MILK I want her to bring her fight to US...
HARVEY MILK This Bill needs a unanimous vote.
HARVEY MILK We need headlines.
JIM RIVALDO Dan White won't vote for this.
JIM RIVALDO Harvey puts his fingers to his lips and points down the hall,
indicating Dan is down there.
Harvey whispers:
HARVEY MILK Dan's fine.
HARVEY MILK He's just uneducated.
HARVEY MILK We can teach him.
HARVEY MILK Dan pops his head into Harvey's office.
DAN WHITE Harvey, committee meets at 9:30.
DAN WHITE Oh, hi Michael, Jim.
DAN WHITE Hey, did you get the invitation to
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) my son's christening?
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) I invited a few of the other supes as well.
HARVEY MILK I'll be there.
DAN WHITE Great!
DAN WHITE All smiles, Dan leaves.
DAN WHITE Cleve mocks him.
DAN WHITE OFF Mike Wong's expression: THAT WAS BIZARRE.
ANNE KRONENBERG Are you going?
HARVEY MILK Hey.
HARVEY MILK I'll let him christen me, if he'll vote for my Gay Rights Ordinance.
HARVEY MILK We need allies.
HARVEY MILK We need everyone.
The neighborhood is booming.
Storefronts and sidewalks filled.
This is not the rundown Castro that Harvey moved into 3 years ago.
Harvey heads home, greeted by his PROUD CONSTITUENTS.
He stops at the CAMERA SHOP when he notices a BROKEN WINDOW near the side entrance to his apartment.
Harvey RUSHES UP THE STAIRS into his apartment and finds: JACK LIRA - Lighting a candle on the table which has been set for a lovely, romantic dinner.
HARVEY Jack?
JACK LIRA Welcome home, Harvey!
JACK LIRA I hope you're hungry.
JACK LIRA I only know how to cook one thing, but I make it good.
HARVEY Did you...
HARVEY break in?
JACK LIRA I asked the boy downstairs to let me in...
HARVEY Danny?
JACK LIRA He wouldn't let me in.
JACK LIRA So I came in this way.
JACK LIRA Your friends aren't very nice to me.
HARVEY I have a Town Hall meeting tonight, Jack.
JACK LIRA You work too hard.
JACK LIRA I'm sorry about your window.
JACK LIRA I'll fix it tomorrow.
JACK LIRA Are you surprised?!
HARVEY MILK Jack, I have to go.
HARVEY MILK I have an invitation to a party tomorrow.
HARVEY MILK Lots of rich people, politicians.
HARVEY MILK We could get all dressed up...
HARVEY MILK Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey's hands and guides him through a simple dance.
JACK LIRA So I could be the first lady?
HARVEY MILK Uh-huh.
JACK LIRA I watched TV here today.
JACK LIRA All day.
JACK LIRA I saw All My Children.
JACK LIRA They killed Margo.
JACK LIRA I knew it was going to happen.
JACK LIRA They try and trick you but it never works.
HARVEY MILK You always see it coming?
JACK LIRA What?
JACK LIRA Killing the blonde?
JACK LIRA Every time.
JACK LIRA I'm good with that.
JACK LIRA I think now the old lady is going to have an affair.
JACK LIRA Then she'll get killed or married.
JACK LIRA Always one or the other.
JACK LIRA Dead or married.
JACK LIRA Jack starts dancing with Harvey again.
JACK LIRA It's sweet, intimate.
HARVEY MILK If I make you a key, you won't break my windows again, right?
JACK LIRA That's right.
JACK LIRA The dance lesson is a lovely distraction.
JACK LIRA Harvey won't be going back to work tonight.
Harvey watches water pour over an INFANT BOY.
He tries hard to feel comfortable, but he's the only Jew, and likely the only gay man at Dan's child's baptism.
Dan looks to Harvey, the proud father.
Harvey waves.
Harvey and Dan have pulled themselves away.
HARVEY MILK I'm proposing a citywide ordinance.
HARVEY MILK It ensures that a person who already has a job can't be fired for their orientation.
DAN WHITE I'm not sure my constituents would favor that.
DAN WHITE Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON.
HARVEY MILK Is anyone else here from the Board?
DAN WHITE You're the only one who showed up I think.
HARVEY MILK Were you christened here?
DAN WHITE Yes.
DAN WHITE Right here.
DAN WHITE Same Parish.
DAN WHITE My grandma immigrated here when this was an Irish Catholic city.
DAN WHITE The City of St.
DAN WHITE Francis...
DAN WHITE A lot's changed here since then.
HARVEY MILK You're more like one of us now...
HARVEY MILK an outsider.
DAN WHITE You're not like most homosexuals, are you, Harvey?
HARVEY MILK Do you know a lot of "homosexuals?"
DAN WHITE Say, where do you stand on the Psychiatric Center the City's been pushing into my district?
HARVEY MILK Well, I'd have to study it...
DAN WHITE Getting it out of my district was a key piece of my platform.
DAN WHITE It only attracts arsonist, rapists, all that, you know.
HARVEY MILK Sure, sure.
HARVEY MILK A campaign promise.
DAN WHITE A big one.
What do you say we watch out for each other's interests?
I'd like that.
HARVEY MILK I'd like that, too, Dan.
HARVEY MILK Mary Ann White approaches with their child.
HARVEY MILK It's awkward, as if she's walked in on something intimate.
DAN WHITE I'm sorry.
DAN WHITE Slipped into some shop talk.
HARVEY MILK The Gay Rights Ordinance.
HARVEY MILK My fault.
Seems an inappropriate subject in here don't you think?
HARVEY MILK Hey, don't knock it till you've tried it.
HARVEY MILK His attempt to break the tension goes down in flames.
HARVEY MILK She cracks a polite smile.
HARVEY MILK They're from very different worlds.
Harvey is under pressure from his own advisors (Michael, Dick, Cleve) to vote against Dan's bill.
DICK PABICH Supervisors Silver and Lau are asking you to vote to keep this Psychiatric Center in Dan's district.
DICK PABICH It'll go down 6 to 5 if you vote to get rid of it.
MICHAEL WONG It's a Youth Campus, Harvey.
MICHAEL WONG These are kids that would be displaced from their families if it's moved.
HARVEY MILK I can't just dump Dan.
HARVEY MILK The guy's got nothing going for him.
HARVEY MILK No friends...
CLEVE JONES Here we go, Harvey to the rescue.
CLEVE JONES Isn't it enough we have to put up with Jack?
HARVEY MILK Lay off.
HARVEY MILK He registered 120 voters last week.
CLEVE JONES So do any of your volunteers, but you don't make them all first lady.
MICHAEL WONG What does Dan White do for you?
MICHAEL WONG Really?
MICHAEL WONG Politically?
HARVEY MILK He intrigues me...
HARVEY MILK I think he may be one of us.
Everyone groans.
Cleve camps it up:
CLEVE JONES Dear God, say it ain't so!
HARVEY MILK It's just a theory...
DICK PABICH You just think he's cute.
HARVEY MILK No...
HARVEY MILK I know what it's like to live that life.
HARVEY MILK That lie.
HARVEY MILK You can see it in Dan's eyes...
HARVEY MILK The fear, the pressure...
HARVEY MILK Anne Kronenberg walks in.
HARVEY MILK She's got that look in her eyes.
HARVEY MILK Something's up.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Good or Bad?
ANNE KRONENBERG Not great.
ANNE KRONENBERG State Senator John Briggs is Anita Bryant's go-to guy in California for sure.
ANNE KRONENBERG He's filed his petition for a statewide referendum to fire all gay teachers and anyone who supports them.
ANNE KRONENBERG A pall falls over the room.
ANNE KRONENBERG This is worse than expected.
HARVEY MILK How many signatures will he need to qualify for the ballot?
CLEVE JONES Whatever.
CLEVE JONES He can get them in two Sundays at church in Orange County.
HARVEY MILK This means the fight's coming here, where we can do something about it!
HARVEY MILK Wichita's one thing, Kansas City.
HARVEY MILK But Anita's heading for San Francisco!
HARVEY MILK She's not going to know what hit her.
HARVEY MILK Smile, children!
HARVEY MILK This is the fight we've been waiting for.
CA State Senator, JOHN BRIGGS, 47, delivers his message to the PRESS, THE TV CREWS, AND A MASS OF PROTESTERS.
HARVEY AND HIS GROUP are amongst the crowd.
JOHN BRIGGS My proposition promises to protect our children from these gay perverts and pedophiles who recruit our children to their deviant lifestyles, including the ones who
do it in our public schools.
It's time to root them out.
In the crowd is teacher TOM AMMIANO, 36, colorful, worked up:
And how are you going to determine who's a homosexual?
JOHN BRIGGS Sir, my bill outlines procedures for identifying homosexuals.
How?
Will you be sucking them off?
JOHN BRIGGS Sir, you can argue with me, but you cannot argue with God.
JOHN BRIGGS It's getting ugly fast.
JOHN BRIGGS Briggs is whisked away by TWO OFFICERS.
JOHN BRIGGS He trips off the curb and is quickly scooped up.
Dan's house is filled with RELATIVES for a birthday celebration.
Dan is glued to the NEWS, watching BRIGGS.
Dan's RELATIVES gather around the TV.
Mary Ann puts their BABY into Dan's arms and returns to wrangling kids.
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) Look what happened in Germany.
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) Now Anita Bryant already says that Jews and Muslims are going to hell, you know she's got a shopping list.
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) We are not going to let John Briggs or Anita Bryant legislate bigotry in this city...
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) Hold on Dan watching Harvey on TV.
Cleve and Anne sit in the entry way, Cleve in his tight jeans and shirt.
He's very out of place amongst all the suits.
Harvey walks in.
Cleve and Anne rush to his side.
David Goodstein and Rick Stokes turn to greet Milk.
DAVID GOODSTEIN Hello, Harvey.
DAVID GOODSTEIN Running late?
Oh Harvey...
your boyfriend is in the closet.
HARVEY MILK Excuse me, David?
The Latino, he's locked himself in the coat room...
Mr. Milk, Phil Burton is here.
He's likely the next Speaker of the House and a much needed ally against Prop Six.
We don't need a scene.
Harvey is at the door.
Jack is locked inside the room.
HARVEY MILK You're right, I know, I was late by twenty minutes.
HARVEY MILK I'm sorry, Jack.
JACK LIRA Who were you with?
JACK LIRA Scott?
JACK LIRA Some boy?
HARVEY MILK I was at work.
HARVEY MILK Come out, sugar pea.
JACK LIRA No.
JACK LIRA You embarrassed me.
JACK LIRA I didn't know anyone.
JACK LIRA These are not good people.
JACK LIRA I don't want to be here.
HARVEY MILK Then go home, Jack.
JACK LIRA No.
JACK LIRA I'll wait for you.
JACK LIRA Go away.
JACK LIRA A tight smile from Harvey as he looks up to Cleve.
Harvey, Cleve and a dozen others are scattered about the room for a meeting with the DEMOCRATIC PARTY ESTABLISHMENT.
U.S.
Congressman PHIL BURTON, 51, leans on a desk, listening.
DAVID GOODSTEIN The Briggs initiative is polling at 75 percent for approval statewide.
CLEVE JONES 80 percent in other polls.
CLEVE JONES Some even have us losing San Francisco.
DAVID GOODSTEIN So it's important we not deceive people into thinking we can beat this, or we'll have riots and only increase this backlash.
Good point, David.
Let's just roll right over.
Make it easier for Briggs to fuck us up the ass.
Rick and David are horrified.
Phil Burton rises above it, passing out copies of his new Anti-Briggs Initiative flier.
PHIL BURTON We're taking this very seriously in my office.
PHIL BURTON We want to send one of these to every home in California.
PHIL BURTON We'll need money to do that.
HARVEY MILK "Proposition Six is an affront to Human Rights.
HARVEY MILK An invasion of the State into the private lives of California citizens."
HARVEY MILK Does it even say the word gay on this thing?
HARVEY MILK Anywhere?
DAVID GOODSTEIN No Harvey, purposefully not.
PHIL BURTON With the heat bearing down on your movement right now, we think it's best to dodge the "gay" bullet.
PHIL BURTON Go for the human rights angle.
HARVEY MILK People need to know who's affected.
HARVEY MILK This flier needs at least one old queen on it.
HARVEY MILK Why don't you volunteer for that, David?
RICK STOKES Corey Wares is an out gay--
HARVEY MILK This is shit.
HARVEY MILK Shit and masturbation.
HARVEY MILK It's a coward's response to a dangerous threat.
DAVID GOODSTEIN I think you should leave.
DAVID GOODSTEIN In the face of Phil Burton, most the others seem to agree.
DAVID GOODSTEIN HARVEY PUTS PHIL BURTON'S FLYER IN THE FIREPLACE on his way out of the room.
Harvey knocks on the coat check door.
HARVEY MILK Jack, it's time to go.
HARVEY MILK Get everyone together.
HARVEY MILK I want young people, women, fresh heads.
HARVEY MILK Fighters and organizers, not politicians.
CLEVE JONES What about, S-C-O-T-T?
CLEVE JONES OFF HARVEY, knowing Scott would be an asset.
CLEVE JONES Jack opens the door and grabs Harvey's hand.
CLEVE JONES They go.
Harvey's clan is assembled (Jim, Dick, Mike, Cleve, Anne, Jack, Denis) along with fiery teacher Tom Amiano and MANY
A HANDSOME PIZZA DELIVERY GUY is setting down boxes of pizzas.
They're in for the night.
The atmosphere is 180 degrees different from the previous stuffy meeting.
CLEVE JONES We're not interested in working with those old Democratic Party shits.
CLEVE JONES THE DOOR OPENS and someone new enters.
CLEVE JONES He's HOLDING THE HAND OF...
CLEVE JONES SCOTT SMITH.
CLEVE JONES They are obviously a new couple.
Scott and his BOYFRIEND find a place on the floor.
Harvey's and Scott's EYES MEET across the room.
JIM RIVALDO But we can't afford infighting anymore, Cleve.
JIM RIVALDO We have to bring together every group.
JIM RIVALDO Even the old school Democrats.
HARVEY MILK Is anybody gonna pay the pizza guy, or are we just gonna stare?
HARVEY MILK People start chipping in for the HANDSOME PIZZA GUY.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) If we're gonna convince the 90% to give a shit about us 10%...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) We have to let 'em know who we are.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Everybody's coming out.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) The entire state.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) No matter where they live.
DICK PABICH "Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
HARVEY MILK I'm serious.
HARVEY MILK We're going to tell everyone in the state to come out.
HARVEY MILK Every gay doctor, lawyer, teacher, dog catcher...
HARVEY MILK We have to leave the ghetto, let all those people out there know that they do know one of us.
HARVEY MILK And if people won't step out of the closet, we open the door for them.
ANNE KRONENBERG Jesus.
SCOTT SMITH The whole state is not San Francisco.
HARVEY MILK Clearly, Scott.
JIM RIVALDO It could be dangerous.
JIM RIVALDO There is such a thing as a right to privacy.
HARVEY MILK Privacy's our enemy.
HARVEY MILK You want real political power?
HARVEY MILK Let's tell the truth for a change.
HARVEY MILK Starting here.
HARVEY MILK If there's anybody in this room, right now, who hasn't told their families, their friends, their employers...
HARVEY MILK Do it.
HARVEY MILK Now.
ANNE KRONENBERG My folks know already.
ANNE KRONENBERG A beat.
ANNE KRONENBERG The room is silent.
ANNE KRONENBERG Dick looks ill.
DICK PABICH I haven't told my father yet...
HARVEY MILK People vote two to one for us if they know just one of us.
Cleve, show Dick where you keep your phone.
CLEVE JONES It's in the bedroom.
CLEVE JONES After a moment, Dick RISES and follows Cleve out of the room.
CLEVE JONES People are stunned by Harvey's outrageous demand.
CLEVE JONES Harvey sees Scott GLARING at him.
The meeting is breaking up, and Scott lets his NEW BOYFRIEND go ahead.
Harvey ducks away from Jack and intercepts Scott.
HARVEY MILK I thought you were done with politics.
SCOTT SMITH Politics.
SCOTT SMITH Not the movement.
SCOTT SMITH What the hell was that in there?
HARVEY MILK The movement needs people to be up- front.
HARVEY MILK Why were you fighting me?
SCOTT SMITH You were the biggest closet case alive in New York.
SCOTT SMITH You told me and all your boyfriends to keep our
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) traps shut.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) You were the hypocrite in there.
HARVEY MILK My parents are gone.
HARVEY MILK My brother knows.
HARVEY MILK I'm sure they knew.
SCOTT SMITH I had to listen to your phone calls home to Mom.
SCOTT SMITH Hear you deny that I existed.
SCOTT SMITH You want to be "normal" as bad as any of us.
SCOTT SMITH More than any of us...
SCOTT SMITH Those are kids in there.
SCOTT SMITH You're asking them to lose their families.
HARVEY MILK If their families won't love them for who they are, who they really are, then they should lose them.
SCOTT SMITH That's fucking insane.
HARVEY MILK Who's he?
HARVEY MILK Do you live together?
SCOTT SMITH Someone I'm seeing.
SCOTT SMITH He's good for me.
SCOTT SMITH He makes me stay home at nights, out of the bars...
HARVEY MILK I miss you.
SCOTT SMITH Oh, Harvey, don't...
SCOTT SMITH What's that about?
JACK LIRA Har-veyyyyy!
HARVEY MILK He needs me.
HARVEY MILK Scott nods.
HARVEY MILK THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN HARVEY'S ACHILLES HEAL.
HARVEY MILK He walks away from Harvey, leaving him alone.
Dianne bangs her gavel like a mad woman.
Harvey's adamant.
I have told no lies here Supervisor Milk, you will today or to Supervisor White come to order.
in the past--
HARVEY MILK --I want it noted that I never promised to back moving any Mental Health Centers.
HARVEY MILK I greatly respect Supervisor White, but I would like his remarks stricken.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN Duly noted.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN We will take a recess before recording the vote.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN Fellow Supervisor, CAROL RUTH SILVER, leans over to Harvey.
CAROL RUTH SILVER Thank you, Harvey.
CAROL RUTH SILVER Harvey is preoccupied with Dan approaching.
CAROL RUTH SILVER He leans back.
DAN WHITE Can I have a moment with Harvey?
DAN WHITE Alone, please, Carol?
DAN WHITE She politely recognizes the tension and gets up.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) Why are you turning on me like this at the last minute?
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) What did I do?
HARVEY MILK I didn't have all the details.
HARVEY MILK I'll help you craft a different version that doesn't displace any kids.
DAN WHITE Harvey, I can't go back to my family and to my folks and to my district without this.
DAN WHITE Don't do this.
HARVEY MILK I'm getting a lot of pressure, Dan.
DAN WHITE You strung me along.
DAN WHITE And now you're throwing me to the wolves.
HARVEY MILK You only need one more vote, Dan.
HARVEY MILK There are 5 other Supervisors you could convince besides me.
HARVEY MILK Dan grabs Harvey.
HARVEY MILK It's threatening.
HARVEY MILK A new side of Dan.
DAN WHITE I'll vote against your Queer Law.
DAN WHITE I'll get Quentin against it.
HARVEY MILK It'll still pass.
HARVEY MILK You can't keep alienating yourself here, Dan.
DAN WHITE I gave you a chance, Harvey.
DAN WHITE I really did.
DAN WHITE You blew it.
DAN WHITE You really blew it.
DAN WHITE Dan goes, the rage of a scorned adolescent under his suit.
Harvey's mood has darkened as he talks into his recorder...
HARVEY MILK Across the country, a handful of city councils had passed the very first ordinances protecting gay people against discrimination.
HARVEY MILK But Anita Bryant and her right wing Christian fundamentalists were creating and exploiting and fanning a backlash.
HARVEY MILK Now she had referenda to repeal all of these gay rights ordinances.
HARVEY MILK While we were preparing for the battle against Briggs and Prop Six, Anita Bryant was taking her show on the road...
HARVEY MILK sweeping the country.
HARVEY MILK Her next stop was Wichita, Kansas.
CHYRON: "Landslide: Wichita says NO to Gays."
Anita talks to a REPORTER.
BRIGGS is among the supporters at her side.
I give thanks for all of our foot soldiers of God here in Wichita.
But we must push on.
Look what happened to Sodom and to the world of Noah.
Onward Christian soldiers!
(lifting her hand with
On to California!
A telephone tree MONTAGE starts with Cleve on a PAY PHONE on Castro Street:
CLEVE JONES Hi.
CLEVE JONES We're losing Wichita.
CLEVE JONES Rally tonight.
CLEVE JONES Sundown.
CLEVE JONES Market and Castro.
CLEVE JONES A MULTIPLYING FRAME EFFECT: the person he called calls two others, they call four, then more and more as the tree grows.
HARVEY'S POV ON: The VIOLENT DEATH THREAT LETTER AND DRAWING that is still tacked up to his refrigerator.
OUTSIDE: The SOUNDS of a RIOT in the making.
Harvey rips down the threatening LETTER and throws it away.
Harvey BOUNDS down the stairs and into the shop.
Cleve RUSHES into the store, breathless.
CLEVE JONES They're moving.
CLEVE JONES I don't know where, but...
HARVEY MILK Did Jim call the press?
HARVEY MILK Get out there with your camera!
DANNY NICCOLETTA I'm going!
CLEVE JONES Press is covered.
CLEVE JONES But we don't have a permit to march.
HARVEY MILK When I got Coors out of the bars, the Union gave me this.
HARVEY MILK I want you to have it.
CLEVE JONES What do I do with this?
HARVEY MILK You're an activist.
HARVEY MILK Take it.
HARVEY MILK March them.
HARVEY MILK March those people up to the front doors of City Hall.
HARVEY MILK When it looks really bad, the city's first gay Supervisor will come out and play peacemaker.
HARVEY MILK We save the city from a riot.
HARVEY MILK We can turn this night into more political power for the cause.
CLEVE JONES I can't do it like you do it.
HARVEY MILK I won't always be here.
HARVEY MILK Somebody else will have to take over.
HARVEY MILK I need you to be the scary one now.
A massive, angry crowd has gathered.
Baby-faced Cleve takes a makeshift stage.
He lifts the bullhorn and with nerves, reads a speech.
Its pages blow about.
CLEVE'S POV: Harvey watches from afar.
Encouraging him.
CLEVE JONES Forty years ago tonight, the gay citizens of Germany found out they no longer had civil rights.
CLEVE JONES Tomorrow morning, the gay citizens of Wichita will also awaken to find that they too have lost their civil rights.
CLEVE JONES You have whistles.
CLEVE JONES You use them when we have been attacked.
CLEVE JONES Tonight we have been attacked.
CLEVE JONES Initially Cleve is successful, but then the crowd turns, marching toward City Hall without him.
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) Fuck.
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) Shit.
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) Harvey!
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) Cleve runs as fast as he can to cut through the crowd, to get to the front.
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) He gets on his walkie-talkie.
CLEVE JONES (CONT'D) Get the press to the overpass!
CLEVE JONES (CONT'D) ON HARVEY: Ducking through EMPTY STREETS, trying to get AHEAD OF THE CROWD and beat them to City Hall.
Cleve gets to the head of the crowd.
CLEVE JONES (CONT'D) Move...
CLEVE JONES (CONT'D) Left...
CLEVE JONES (CONT'D) Move...
CLEVE JONES (CONT'D) Left...
JIM RIVALDO What are you doing?
JIM RIVALDO Where's Harvey?
CLEVE JONES We're shutting down traffic, both directions.
CLEVE JONES Cleve looks up at the press that's arrived on the overpass above, and turns to two HIPPIE KIDS near the front.
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) Disconnect the power arms!
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) The boys climb up a trolley and knock down the power arms.
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) Sparks fly.
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) Brakes squeal.
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) The press snaps photos.
The angry protesters march past the large glass windows of TWIN PEAKS bar.
Unlike the Dade County march, the bar is empty.
The patrons are already in the streets.
Harvey RACES to his office.
He stops at a mirror to straighten his tie and collect himself.
OUTSIDE: The SOUND of the ANGRY MOB on City Hall's front steps.
"Civil Rights or Civil War!" Someone THROWS A ROCK at the City Hall doors.
Harvey rushes out the front doors, pushing past the police to greet THE MOB on City Hall's front steps.
Through the glass doors we see Cleve rush up and hand Harvey his bullhorn:
HARVEY MILK Hello.
HARVEY MILK My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you.
HARVEY MILK I want to recruit you for the fight to preserve our democracy against the Anita Bryants and John Briggs who are trying to legalize bigotry!
HARVEY MILK We have a choice to make.
HARVEY MILK The fight is at our doors.
HARVEY MILK We must either go back in the closet and shut it tight, or fight...
HARVEY MILK History shows
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) that if we continue to fight, we...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) will...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) win.
Jim, Dick, Anne, Michael, Frank and Cleve are all in the office.
The FRONT PAGE of the Examiner features a PICTURE OF CLEVE AND HARVEY ARM IN ARM on City Hall's steps.
Cleve is jazzed.
Harvey stews.
CLEVE JONES They're calling it a "successful mediation."
CLEVE JONES You're a God damn hero.
CLEVE JONES Fuck.
CLEVE JONES It came this close to a riot.
HARVEY Lose the note cards next time.
HARVEY Your job is just to say into that bullhorn what they're all feeling.
CLEVE JONES You're just jealous it wasn't you out there.
HARVEY MILK We're losing Prop Six by 60% and you're over there celebrating a riot.
HARVEY MILK I need more visibility...
HARVEY MILK If we're going to beat this thing, we have to get Briggs to acknowledge us.
HARVEY MILK Harvey steps away, hot, pensive.
HARVEY MILK Anne gets quiet.
ANNE KRONENBERG Every paper's calling Prop Six the main event now.
ANNE KRONENBERG We lose this, we'll have anti-gay laws in all fifty states, and Briggs won't return our calls for a public debate.
DICK PABICH He's ignoring us to death.
HARVEY MILK We need something populist.
HARVEY MILK What's the number one complaint about city life?
CLEVE JONES The piss smell in the Tenderloin.
HARVEY MILK Close.
Dog shit.
JIM RIVALDO If you cleaned up all the dog shit in the city, you could be elected Mayor.
CLEVE JONES "Mayor Milk."
HARVEY MILK I like it.
Cleve searches frantically for something...
He SEES a pile of DOG POOP.
He scoops it up and runs it back to City Hall's front lawn and plants it in the grass.
IN THE VERY SAME SPOT CLEVE JUST WAS: Harvey with a clump of REPORTERS, a red and white "No on 6" button pinned to his lapel (HENCEFORTH, IT'S A FIXTURE).
HARVEY MILK Dog mess is a hazard, and on top of that, it's disgusting.
HARVEY MILK Under the ordinance, dog owners that don't clean up can be fined.
HARVEY MILK This really is the bottom line!
HARVEY MILK He smiles at his own joke, punctuating it by "accidentally" stepping in Cleve's well-placed dog shit.
HARVEY MILK A BIG grin.
HARVEY MILK BULBS
FLASH.
These flashes transition into:
HARVEY STUDIES HIS OWN PHOTO on the FRONT PAGE of the Chronicle, making his announcement about dog poop.
The SUPERVISORS are assembled for a vote.
The CLERK, 60, wraps up his roll call
CLERK Supervisor Lau?
Aye.
CLERK Lau, Aye.
CLERK Supervisor Silver?
CAROL RUTH SILVER Aye.
CLERK Silver, Aye.
CLERK Supervisor White?
DAN WHITE No.
CLERK White, No.
CLERK Madam President, I have ten ayes and one no.
CLERK Dianne Feinstein BANGS HER GAVEL down hard.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN The San Francisco Gay Rights Ordinance sponsored by Supervisors Milk and Silver is passed.
Harvey locks onto Dan White.
Dan makes eye contact.
Harvey turns his attention to the chamber audience's applause.
A gaggle of press has congregated.
Mayor Moscone and Harvey walk into the office keeping their conversation private.
MAYOR MOSCONE I can't get my stories on page ten, you're getting page one?
HARVEY MILK Doggy-doo's a real problem, George.
HARVEY MILK With a shit eating grin, Harvey offers up a powder blue pen.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Powder blue to sign they city's first Gay Rights law...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) George, we need your help with Briggs...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) The gay community will have your back from now on.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) On all issues.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I hope you'll have ours.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) A beat between them.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) An alliance is forming.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) The Mayor sits behind his desk and turns to the press with Harvey's pen.
MAYOR MOSCONE Good morning, everyone...
MAYOR MOSCONE I don't do this enough, taking swift and unambiguous action on a substantive move for civil rights.
MAYOR MOSCONE Moscone signs the law with the powder blue pen.
MAYOR MOSCONE Harvey leans over him.
MAYOR MOSCONE THE PRESS CAPTURES THE MOMENT.
Dan sits at his desk, agitated.
DAN'S POV: The FRONT PAGE of the Examiner featuring MOSCONE AND HARVEY.
Harvey comes to the door.
HARVEY MILK What are you working on, Dan?
DAN WHITE If you have something to discuss, you can have your aide make an appointment with my aide.
HARVEY MILK Listen, I know you're disappointed about the Psychiatric Center...
HARVEY MILK What else do you have coming up?
DAN WHITE Now you need something from me.
DAN WHITE You want my me to join in with the Queers on this Prop Six business?
HARVEY MILK We prefer the word "gay," Dan.
HARVEY MILK Just as I'm sure you prefer the word, "Irish-American" to "Mick."
DAN WHITE Harvey, our society can't exist without the family, without the church.
HARVEY MILK We're not against those things.
DAN WHITE You're not?
DAN WHITE Can two men reproduce?
HARVEY MILK No.
HARVEY MILK But, we keep trying!
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) C'mon, Dan.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) You're channeling Anita and Briggs...
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) we can work together.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) On something...
DAN WHITE Okay.
DAN WHITE You introduce an initiative for Supervisor pay raises.
HARVEY MILK It's a bad time politically.
HARVEY MILK I have an election next year.
DAN WHITE You asked for something.
DAN WHITE Introduce pay raises.
DAN WHITE I can't take care of my family on our salaries.
DAN WHITE You don't have that problem, do you?
DAN WHITE Dan's AIDE steps into the doorway.
DAN WHITE She seems surprised to see Harvey in Dan's office.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) Mr. Milk, You'll excuse me, I have a development meeting.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) Dan goes.
A crowd sings a??Happy Birthday.a?? One after another, Harvey's guests throw CREAM PIES in his face.
RICK AND DAVID GOODSTEIN INCLUDED.
A PEACE OFFERING.
Harvey wipes pie from his eyes.
In the B.G. the black drag queen sensation, SYLVESTER, breaks into his top 10 anthem, "You Make Me Feel."
It's a who's who of San Francisco's political elite.
Jack scoots up to Harvey.
HARVEY MILK What's wrong, Taco Bell?
JACK LIRA Anne and Cleve tried to cut me out of your table.
JACK LIRA You should fire them.
HARVEY MILK I'll take it under consideration.
HARVEY MILK Why don't you get us a drink?
HARVEY MILK A kiss and Jack heads to the bar.
HARVEY MILK Scott approaches.
SCOTT SMITH Don't let Cezar Chavez hear you calling him Taco Bell.
HARVEY MILK He's getting better.
HARVEY MILK He's enrolling in classes on Monday.
HARVEY MILK Scott wipes PIE CREAM from Harvey's jacket.
SCOTT SMITH I remember when your birthdays were a bit less...
SCOTT SMITH lavish.
SCOTT SMITH More intimate.
HARVEY MILK Who invited you?
HARVEY MILK Anne?
SCOTT SMITH My boyfriend got an invitation.
SCOTT SMITH I was his "plus one."
HARVEY MILK Congratulations.
HARVEY MILK It was a tough ticket to get.
SCOTT SMITH Congratulations to you.
SCOTT SMITH Looks like you're part of the Machine now.
SCOTT SMITH You can do better.
HARVEY MILK When I come home to Jack, I don't have to talk politics or talk intelligently.
HARVEY MILK Or even talk.
And where's an old man like me going to get such a good looking young man, right?
SCOTT SMITH You're not so old.
SCOTT SMITH You look handsome...
SCOTT SMITH Happy 48th.
SCOTT SMITH Looks like you're gonna make it to fifty after- all, Mr. Milk.
SCOTT SMITH Scott gives Harvey a BIRTHDAY KISS.
Harvey, still wearing cream pie remnants on his jacket, waits for Jack to come out of the rest room.
Harvey's one of the last guests to leave.
WAITERS are clearing tables.
APPROACHES, footsteps ECHOING on the marble floor.
Harvey braces himself.
Emerging from the shadows: DAN WHITE.
He approaches Harvey with a bottle of Chivas.
Dan is SUPER-FRIENDLY, as if nothing unpleasant has ever happened between them.
DAN WHITE Sorry I missed the party, Harv...
HARVEY MILK No problem, Dan.
HARVEY MILK Good to see you.
DAN WHITE Dog poop?
HARVEY MILK Yeah.
DAN WHITE It's good!
DAN WHITE It's a good one.
HARVEY MILK Thanks.
HARVEY MILK But it's a real problem.
DAN WHITE Oh, yeah.
DAN WHITE I mean, God knows how many problems it causes.
DAN WHITE All kinds of diseases, birth defects probably, I mean, stuff you can't even...
DAN WHITE Hey, I got you a little something.
HARVEY MILK You didn't have to--
DAN WHITE You didn't have to--
Why do people always say that?
"You didn't have to?" I mean, of course, right?
But, that's what they always say.
They always say things like that...
Dan's attempts to be witty and erudite (like Harvey) only leave him confused and tongue tied.
Harvey HAS NO IDEA why Dan is here.
HARVEY MILK Are you okay, Dan?
DAN WHITE Oh, what?
DAN WHITE Yeah, sure.
DAN WHITE Harvey, I just...
DAN WHITE I just want to say...
DAN WHITE Happy Birthday.
DAN WHITE Dan PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND HARVEY for a sort-of macho but really weird birthday hug.
DAN WHITE Harvey stiffens, it's such a peculiar moment.
DAN WHITE Dan steps back, looks him over.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) I've really learned a lot from watching you, Harvey.
HARVEY MILK I doubt that.
DAN WHITE No, I have.
DAN WHITE You gotta get out there.
DAN WHITE Get noticed.
DAN WHITE That's how it works.
DAN WHITE But, you have an issue.
DAN WHITE That's your advantage.
HARVEY MILK It's more than an issue, Dan.
HARVEY MILK Dan.
HARVEY MILK I've had four relationships in my life.
HARVEY MILK Three of those four tried to kill themselves.
HARVEY MILK I know it was my fault they did it.
HARVEY MILK I told them to stay quiet.
HARVEY MILK To hide.
HARVEY MILK Most of my life I've been closeted.
HARVEY MILK That's what living this life is like for most of us.
HARVEY MILK The way things are...
HARVEY MILK This isn't just about our jobs, or any issue, it's our lives we're fighting for.
HARVEY MILK Jack emerges from the bathroom, barely together and leans on Harvey.
HARVEY MILK Dan steps back from Harvey and Jack, his moment alone stolen away.
DAN WHITE I've learned a lot from you, Harvey.
DAN WHITE I'm going to get my picture in the papers, too.
DAN WHITE You'll see.
DAN WHITE I've got my own issue.
DAN WHITE That's right.
DAN WHITE Dan White's Got An Issue!
STOCK FOOTAGE: Along Market street: 375,000 people have shown up for the parade, many holding signs naming their hometowns: Newark, San Antonio, Lincoln.
A MONTAGE: of the various marchers, floats, "Parents and Friends Of", high-camp drag queens, etc.
Harvey sits on top of a car with a pink lei around his neck, a fistful of white flowers in one hand, and in the other, a hand written sign: "I'm from Woodmere, NY."
To a news camera:
HARVEY MILK Come out!
HARVEY MILK Just come on out!
HARVEY MILK DRIVING THE CAR: Anne keeps a close eye on the parade watchers.
HARVEY MILK Any one of them could be an assassin.
DAN WHITE I see naked men walking around, naked women walking around, which doesn't bother me as far as my personal standards of nudity, but it's not proper.
DAN WHITE We wouldn't allow it for any other parade in San Francisco, and it should not be allowed for the gay parade.
Just off stage.
Anne hands him a typed postcard.
ANNE KRONENBERG It came in the mail today.
HARVEY MILK "You get the first bullet the minute you stand at the microphone."
HARVEY MILK Looks like the publicity's working.
ANNE KRONENBERG You don't have to go up there.
HARVEY MILK It could happen any day, any night, any time...
HARVEY MILK The nation's eye is on us.
HARVEY MILK I have to do this.
HARVEY MILK JUMP TO: POV shots of cops and loners amongst the massive audience hint at Harvey's paranoia.
HARVEY MILK Like diving off a cliff, Harvey launches up to the microphone.
HARVEY MILK The deafening cheers surely would have drowned
out gunfire, but when it fades, He's standing.
He delivers his impassioned call to action:
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I want to recruit you for the fight to preserve your democracy.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Brothers and sisters, you must come out.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Come out to your parents.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I know that it is hard and will hurt them but think about how they will hurt you in the voting booth!
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Come out to your friends, if they indeed are your friends.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Come out to your neighbors, to your fellow workers.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Once and for all, break down the myths, destroy the lies and distortions.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) For your sake.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) For their sake.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) For the sake of the youngsters who are becoming scared by the votes from Dade to Eugene.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) On the Statue of Liberty it says "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free."
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) In the Declaration of Independence it is written "All men are created equal and are endowed with certain inalienable rights."
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) For Mr. Briggs and Mrs. Bryant and all the bigots out there, no matter how hard you try, you cannot erase those words from the Declaration of Independence.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) No matter how hard you try, you cannot chip those words from off the base of the Statue of Liberty.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) That is what America is.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Love it or leave it.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Wild applause.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) He scans the crowd as he steps off stage.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) A bit surprised to still be alive.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Cleve grabs him.
CLEVE JONES The Mayor says Briggs is on his way here.
CLEVE JONES He could intercept him for us.
CLEVE JONES We could get him face to face.
CLEVE JONES He couldn't ignore us anymore.
HARVEY MILK Get the press.
John Briggs rides in a limo watching the a??freaks" outside.
As he nears the Parade Stages his POLICE ESCORTS take an unplanned turn.
He leans forward.
JOHN BRIGGS The parade is the other direction.
They're taking us another way, Sir.
The limo pulls in.
Briggs cautiously steps out.
Greeting him are Moscone, the POLICE CHIEF, 25 SFPD officers, a gaggle of press, and Harvey Milk.
It's a showdown...
HIGH NOON.
JOHN BRIGGS I have a right to be here, Mr. Mayor.
MAYOR MOSCONE I'm afraid it's not in the interest of your safety, or my public's safety to let you into that parade grounds.
MAYOR MOSCONE Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand.
MAYOR MOSCONE Its a show for the FLASHING CAMERAS.
MAYOR MOSCONE Briggs is clearly uncomfortable.
HARVEY MILK Hi, I'm Harvey Milk.
HARVEY MILK It's quite an honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.
JOHN BRIGGS I'm aware.
JOHN BRIGGS Sad you're too afraid to fight this out in public, Mr. Milk.
HARVEY MILK No sir.
HARVEY MILK I would love to have a public debate.
HARVEY MILK I'm very interested in the details of your argument.
JOHN BRIGGS You know the details.
JOHN BRIGGS As do the people.
JOHN BRIGGS Look at the votes across this nation.
JOHN BRIGGS The "public" is with me.
HARVEY MILK Yes sir, today they are.
HARVEY MILK But with my City's Mayor and the San Francisco press as my witnesses, I'm challenging you to a public debate.
HARVEY MILK John nods, stiff.
HARVEY MILK He can no longer avoid Harvey Milk.
HARVEY MILK He gets back in his limo.
Harvey sits with John Briggs at a table facing forward.
We hear the cheers and jeers of the packed audience.
HARVEY MILK Senator, as a Christian it's interesting that you don't seem to understand what Christ was about.
HARVEY MILK He was about accepting people and giving love, not carrying a Bible in one hand and hatred in the other...
HARVEY MILK ...Now all the gay myths have been shattered, all the fears, all the--
JOHN BRIGGS Not in my mind they haven't--
HARVEY MILK That's it.
HARVEY MILK In your mind they haven't, and I'm wondering why--
JOHN BRIGGS Mr. Milk, we don't allow people who believe in practicing bestiality to teach our children, and the reason we don't is because it is illegal.
JOHN BRIGGS But it's not illegal to be a homosexual in California.
HARVEY MILK And your law goes even further.
HARVEY MILK Any school employee who even supports a gay person will be fired--
JOHN BRIGGS True.
JOHN BRIGGS But, gay people don't have children of their own.
JOHN BRIGGS If they don't recruit our children, they'd all die away.
JOHN BRIGGS That's why they want to be teachers, to encourage our children to join them.
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) How do you teach homosexuality?
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) Like French?
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) I was born of heterosexual parents, I was taught by heterosexual teachers in a fiercely heterosexual society.
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) So then why am I homosexual?
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) And no offense meant, but if it were true that children mimicked their
teachers, you'd sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around.
The audience eats it up.
It feel like "The Harvey Milk Show."
Briggs makes a STATEMENT to the press.
JOHN BRIGGS If they're going to lead such an open life of homosexuality that they want a 21-gun salute every time somebody goes by them, those people are going to be in danger of being removed their job.
Continuing on with his recorded will...
HARVEY MILK We were really genuinely frightened by Proposition Six, and with the backlash gaining strength, we were very pessimistic.
HARVEY MILK We didn't think there was any chance we could beat it.
HARVEY MILK What we hoped to do was to organize to the point that when we did lose, there would be a revolt...
HARVEY MILK That all hell would break lose.
Harvey, pacing, decisive.
DICK PABICH People are coming out, though.
DICK PABICH We met with groups in Bakersfield, Redding, a dozen people showed up in a library basement in Fresno asking for our support if they came out.
DICK PABICH Last Sunday, the Reverend of St.
DICK PABICH Mary's came out to his entire congregation...
HARVEY MILK We're still losing, 60 to 30.
HARVEY MILK We have to take the show on the road.
HARVEY MILK Call Briggs's office.
HARVEY MILK Do a press release.
HARVEY MILK Tell them he can pick the town, the audience, and I'll ask our supporters not to attend.
DICK PABICH Their audiences are insanely devout.
DICK PABICH We'll get killed.
HARVEY MILK Get me Orange County.
Jack is FLIPPING OUT, storming around the place.
JACK LIRA You just have to go down to LA and guess the right things on TV and they'll pay us...
JACK LIRA You have to use your fame now while you have it.
JACK LIRA We could have nice things.
HARVEY MILK I don't have time to do game shows right now...
HARVEY MILK This stops Jack cold.
JACK LIRA You are horrible!
JACK LIRA I have worked on this surprise for you for weeks!
HARVEY MILK Are you drunk right now?
JACK LIRA You are an ungrateful asshole!
HARVEY MILK Jack, I'll have more time soon.
JACK LIRA You're ashamed of me!
HARVEY MILK That's not true.
HARVEY MILK I think you're smart.
HARVEY MILK You're capable.
HARVEY MILK No matter what your family or your father said.
HARVEY MILK I believe in you...
HARVEY MILK We should figure out something for you to do.
HARVEY MILK I could get you a job.
JACK LIRA I'll never be good enough for you!
JACK LIRA Jack THROWS A PIECE OF POTTERY AT HARVEY.
JACK LIRA It misses, CRASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW onto the street below.
HARVEY MILK I'll get a broom.
HARVEY MILK Harvey goes.
HARVEY MILK Jack collapses into a chair.
TV CAMERAS ROLL.
They've gotten their ORANGE COUNTY DEBATE!
BRIGGS'S SUPPORTERS jeer Harvey as he rips into their State Senator.
Their vehemence frightens Dick in the audience.
Harvey lifts a Briggs flier.
HARVEY MILK If in your statements here you say that child molestation is not an issue, why do you put out literature that hammers it home, why do you play on that myth and fear?
JOHN BRIGGS Same thing with VD Harvey, we put out publications about VD so you can avoid it.
HARVEY MILK But you've even admitted that there's more molestation in the heterosexual group!
HARVEY MILK So why not get rid of the heterosexual teachers?
HARVEY MILK Boos from the conservative audience.
JOHN BRIGGS We are not talking about homos...
JOHN BRIGGS child molestation, the fact is, at least 95 percent of the people are heterosexual.
JOHN BRIGGS If we took heterosexuals out AND homosexuals out, you know what--
--we'd have no teachers We'd have no teachers--
HARVEY MILK --No child molestation...
HARVEY MILK So you're saying the percentage of population is equal to the percentage of child molestation?
JOHN BRIGGS No, no, I'm not saying that at all--
HARVEY MILK That's what you just said.
JOHN BRIGGS No.
JOHN BRIGGS I'm saying that we cannot prevent child molestation so let's cut our odds down and take out the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group-- Harvey laughs in disbelief at the asinine argument.
JOHN BRIGGS Briggs looks down to his notes, lost.
JOHN BRIGGS Harvey takes the opportunity
to rip into the State Senator:
HARVEY MILK --Sir, in your own drive for personal power, how many careers are you willing to see destroyed?
HARVEY MILK How many lives will you destroy in your lust for power, and when will you stop?
HARVEY MILK The crowd boos, rails.
HARVEY MILK This isn't San Francisco, it's Orange County.
HARVEY MILK In the audience, Dick Pabich sweats, taken aback by the level of hatred.
HARVEY MILK Harvey tries to maintain his composure.
Harvey heads home from work.
He starts into his store.
He sees JACK LIRA'S SHADOW through the curtains upstairs, and turns instead to the cafe next door.
Harvey sits down at the bar.
The WAITER pours a coffee for him.
Harvey looks up to the TV.
HARVEY'S POV: DAN WHITE ON TV talking to a news reporter.
It feels as if Dan is talking directly to Harvey.
DAN WHITE All I'm really saying is, if we don't protect ourselves with this kind of legislation, a transvestite can show up at a public school with all the qualifications for teaching and they can't refuse to hire him.
Harvey rushes from a packed session in the Supervisors' Chambers to his office.
Anne is behind him.
He picks up the phone.
It seems urgent.
HARVEY MILK Hey Jack, what's wrong?
JACK LIRA Nothing.
JACK LIRA I just want to know when you'll be home.
HARVEY MILK You just had them pull me out of my big vote on the dog shit ordinance.
HARVEY MILK Did you do this on purpose, Jack?
JACK LIRA It's poop, Harvey.
JACK LIRA Aren't I more important than poop?
HARVEY MILK Yes, but...
HARVEY MILK I don't know when I'll be home.
HARVEY MILK Maybe 6.
HARVEY MILK 6:15.
JACK LIRA Fine.
JACK LIRA 6:15.
JACK LIRA Harvey hangs up.
JACK LIRA His patience is slipping.
JACK LIRA He looks up in time to see Dan heading down the hall with his briefcase.
Harvey catches up to Dan who is on his way out.
HARVEY MILK Dan?
HARVEY MILK How's the baby?
DAN WHITE You didn't bring up Supervisor pay raises.
DAN WHITE In fact, I heard you plan to publicly oppose them.
HARVEY MILK I heard you planned to vote against them too, Dan.
HARVEY MILK Were you trying to set me up?
DAN WHITE (parrotting Harvey
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) It's not a good time for me to bring it up.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) Politically.
HARVEY MILK Dan, there's a vote to approve the police desegregation settlement, give me that and I'll consider backing pay raises.
DAN WHITE I don't trade votes...
DAN WHITE unlike you, the way I was raised, we believe in right and wrong.
DAN WHITE Moral and immoral.
HARVEY MILK Black skin and White in your police department?
HARVEY MILK Dan, even Ronald Reagan's come out against Proposition Six.
HARVEY MILK You're looking more and more out of touch.
DAN WHITE If I come out against Prop Six, it's only for the invasion of State's rights issue.
HARVEY MILK And the potential witch hunts against you "straight people," right?
HARVEY MILK Dan tries hard to come up with a cogent response.
HARVEY MILK He can't.
HARVEY MILK His behavior is alarming.
HARVEY MILK He sets down his briefcase.
DAN WHITE You underestimate me, Milk.
DAN WHITE You're very, very wrong about me.
HARVEY MILK I don't know what you mean.
HARVEY MILK A moment.
HARVEY MILK Dan is on the verge of tears, hot angry tears.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) What is it, Dan?
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) You can tell me.
DAN WHITE You don't...
DAN WHITE You can't humiliate me.
DAN WHITE And you will not demean me.
Anne appears down the hall.
Dan has more on his mind, but the moment has passed.
He picks up his briefcase and walks out of the building.
Off Harvey, concerned.
Harvey walks home.
A PASSERBY shouts:
You're the asshole that just passed that dog shit thing aren't you?
What the hell do you have against dogs?
HARVEY MILK Sir, blind people can't see "shit."
HARVEY MILK What the heck do you have against blind people?
HARVEY MILK The young folks surrounding the PASSERBY laugh and hoot at Harvey's joke.
HARVEY MILK Even the harassing PASSERBY can't help but crack a grin.
HARVEY MILK Harvey beams.
Opening the door, Harvey finds a trail of voter registration cards, anti-Briggs literature, and Coors beer cans.
Pushing through his fear, he carefully follows the cans and flyers up the stairs and through his apartment.
Odd notes are taped to the walls.
They all lead to a black velvet curtain with a note attached: "YOU'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE
Harvey pulls back the curtain to find Jack's body, cold and discolored, hanging from a beam by a noose.
HARVEY CAN'T MOVE.
He is mesmerized...
horrified.
He grabs a knife and frantically tries cutting Jack down.
He cuts through the rope and FALLS TO THE FLOOR with the HEAVY
Scott arrives.
Sitting very still, Harvey is being consoled by Cleve and Anne.
Tears in his eyes, Harvey won't look up.
SCOTT SMITH Harvey.
SCOTT SMITH Look at me.
SCOTT SMITH Look at me.
SCOTT SMITH You did everything you could.
HARVEY No, I didn't.
HARVEY Not everything...
SCOTT SMITH What else could you have done?
HARVEY I could have come home at six o'clock, not six-fifteen.
HARVEY Scott puts his arm around Harvey.
HARVEY Harvey buries his head.
HARVEY Anne helps Cleve take down Jack's many hidden notes.
HARVEY Cleve
quietly reads a prominently placed one:
CLEVE JONES "Beware.
CLEVE JONES The ides.
CLEVE JONES Of November."
Into the recorder as if re-living the event over again...
HARVEY MILK Jack was gone.
HARVEY MILK I didn't have time to mourn...
HARVEY MILK There was no choice but to keep on...
HARVEY MILK to keep fighting.
Harvey sits in a make-up chair.
A MAKE-UP artist is painting him up to look like a clown.
Several other CITY OFFICIALS are in chairs beyond him.
Harvey turns to the make-up artist.
With sincere enthusiasm:
HARVEY MILK Thank you for this great honor.
HARVEY MILK But do you think once the magazine is done snapping pictures, maybe I could keep the suit for a while?
Still made up from head to toe as a clown, Harvey walks the streets of San Francisco.
He waves, smiles, poses for photos with tourists.
It's a rare moment of grace.
He jumps on a trolley headed toward Castro.
He instantly captures the imagination of a small GIRL wearing a knit hat.
HARVEY MILK Would you like to trade with me?
No.
What the heck are you?
HARVEY MILK Oh, me?
HARVEY MILK I'm an elected official.
HARVEY MILK I run this city.
He makes a show of it.
She smiles.
He hands her the flower he's been holding onto all afternoon.
THIS IS THE MOMENT.
Harvey watches aides on the phones comb districts for voting results.
Jim fills up a map on the wall.
DICK PABICH San Bernadino is coming in.
DICK PABICH Not good.
HARVEY MILK Of course not.
HARVEY MILK How not good?
MICHAEL WONG 60% for Briggs.
MICHAEL WONG Same in Fresno.
HARVEY MILK Dear God, little Lotus Blossom.
HARVEY MILK Harvey is stunned.
HARVEY MILK Other districts follow with similar results.
HARVEY MILK They go up in red on the map.
JIM RIVALDO Imperial is 69% "for" so far.
HARVEY MILK Put it up on the board.
HARVEY MILK Harvey tries to stomach this major defeat, loss after loss.
HARVEY MILK He starts reflexively tying his tie in a knot.
HARVEY MILK Cleve comes up to Harvey, concerned.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) The whole world is watching this.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) This is San Francisco we're about to lose.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Are you ready?
CLEVE JONES I can have 15,000 people in an hour.
CLEVE JONES But there's gonna be riots if this thing passes.
HARVEY MILK There goddamn better be.
CLEVE JONES What are you telling me?
HARVEY MILK I can't say it because I'm a public official, but for God's sake, if this thing passes, fight back.
HARVEY MILK Cleve is stunned, holding the weight of Harvey's words.
HARVEY MILK Harvey's focus is interrupted when Anne brings him the phone.
ANNE KRONENBERG Don Amador down in LA.
HARVEY Kind of a bad time, Don.
YOUNG TEEN (V.O.) No sir, this is Paul.
YOUNG TEEN (V.O.) Don just gave me the phone.
HARVEY MILK Paul who?
YOUNG TEEN (V.O.) You talked to me on the phone a year or so ago.
YOUNG TEEN (V.O.) I'm from Minnesota...
YOUNG TEEN (V.O.) I'm in a wheelchair.
YOUNG TEEN (V.O.) REVEAL: The boy in his wheelchair on the other end.
HARVEY MILK I thought you were a goner, Paul.
YOUNG TEEN I'm sorry.
YOUNG TEEN I should have called.
YOUNG TEEN When I read in the paper that you won the Supervisor seat, I got a friend to put me on a bus to LA.
HARVEY MILK Who did you know in Los Angeles?
YOUNG TEEN Nobody.
YOUNG TEEN That's the uh...
YOUNG TEEN I just didn't want to die anymore, sir.
YOUNG TEEN I met your friend Don down here.
YOUNG TEEN I turned 18.
YOUNG TEEN I voted today against Prop Six...
YOUNG TEEN Thank you, Mr. Milk.
HARVEY MILK No.
HARVEY MILK You did this all by yourself.
YOUNG TEEN I don't think I'd be alive right now without you, sir.
YOUNG TEEN You were right about LA.
YOUNG TEEN It's like gay Disney World.
HARVEY MILK Then you have to see San Francisco!
YOUNG TEEN Okay.
YOUNG TEEN I will.
YOUNG TEEN Don wanted me to um...
YOUNG TEEN congratulate you on what he says looks like a big win for us tonight.
YOUNG TEEN Congratulations Mr. Milk.
YOUNG TEEN Harvey turns back to the map.
YOUNG TEEN Jim Rivaldo is now coloring in LA county with green.
YOUNG TEEN On the other end of the phone, Harvey's friend in LA, Don Amador, is back on the line.
It looks like we've taken LA County, Harvey.
By 65%.
It's huge.
HARVEY MILK I gotta go, Don.
HARVEY MILK Thank you.
HARVEY MILK LA by 65% put it up!
HARVEY MILK Put it up!
HARVEY MILK The tone in the room is changing.
HARVEY MILK Jim storms up.
JIM RIVALDO The polls were off.
JIM RIVALDO Briggs is going down by more than 2 to 1.
JIM RIVALDO The only district where it's leading in San Francisco is Dan White's.
JIM RIVALDO Harvey takes a moment to absorb the map.
JIM RIVALDO Anne, Dick & Jim, all the volunteers.
JIM RIVALDO What this apparent win means to him, to
his people.
To Cleve:
HARVEY MILK Well crap Cleve, now what are we going to do tonight?!
HARVEY MILK Cover up Lady Liberty.
HARVEY MILK The cameras will be coming our way.
TV cameras roll.
Lady liberty is covered with a "No on Six" poster.
A brass band marches dramatically into the hall.
Balloons fall.
Harvey MOUNTS the stage to INCREDIBLE CHEERS.
HARVEY MILK To the gay community all over this state...
HARVEY MILK my message to you is...
HARVEY MILK so far a lot of people joined us and rejected Proposition Six, and now we owe them something...
HARVEY MILK We must destroy the myths once and for all, shatter them.
HARVEY MILK We must continue to speak out...
HARVEY MILK and most importantly, most importantly, every gay person must come out.
Tonight...
Tonight it is clear that everyone out there does know one of us.
And now that they do, they see we are not sick...
they can feel we are not wrong...
and they know we should have a place in this great country and in this world...
A message of hope has been to sent to all the young people out there...
to all those afraid of this wave of hate...
to all those who have lost their homes and their hometowns...
tonight we know there is a place for us!
My brothers and sisters...
we can come home again!
The crowd goes WILD.
Harvey BEAMS.
Moscone walks up onto stage and lifts Harvey's hand.
Harvey is now a member of the S.F.
political elite.
Cleve watches from afar as Harvey steps off and disappears into the crowd.
Dan watches HARVEY'S VICTORY SPEECH on the local news.
The party behind him, Harvey scans the block.
Cleve catches up, looking at Harvey, probing:
CLEVE JONES What's the matter?
HARVEY MILK You ever heard of sore losers?
HARVEY MILK Well, I'm a sore winner...
HARVEY MILK I thought we were goners.
I'd started looking forward to the riots.
CLEVE JONES I told you, I don't "do" losing.
HARVEY MILK I think maybe we're best with our backs to the wall.
HARVEY MILK It's too quiet.
HARVEY MILK I think we should march on Washington D.C. next year.
CLEVE JONES Milk, you're a decent politician, a mediocre businessman, but you're a lousy gay man.
CLEVE JONES Take some time off.
CLEVE JONES Fifty's right around the corner.
CLEVE JONES Nobody will want you after that...
CLEVE JONES I can handle D.C.
HARVEY MILK The people voted for us, Cleve Jones.
CLEVE JONES They did.
CLEVE JONES There's nowhere to march tonight, Mr. Harvey Milk.
CLEVE JONES Lets go back inside.
CLEVE JONES Turning back, they savor the moment, like father and son walking to Castro Camera, growing ever smaller in the frame.
Dan White slides a sealed letter across a desk to an Aide.
It's addressed to Moscone.
He seems oddly calm.
DAN WHITE Could you give this to the Mayor for me?
DAN WHITE As soon as possible.
Harvey walks down the hallway to his office, a spring in his step.
There are nods, hellos if not outright deference from most passersby.
His newfound political muscle is evident.
He comes face to face with Dan White.
HARVEY MILK Morning, Dan.
DAN WHITE I just resigned.
DAN WHITE Congratulations.
DAN WHITE I'm sure you're pleased.
DAN WHITE Harvey doesn't know what to say.
DAN WHITE Dan's right, it does make him happy.
DAN WHITE But it's not that simple.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) You'll be the next President of the Board.
HARVEY MILK I'm sure we could work together-- Dan walks away from Harvey.
HARVEY MILK He doesn't want to hear anything Harvey has to say.
HARVEY MILK Harvey watches as Dan is met in the hallway by an OFFICER from the POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.
OFFICER Hey, Dan.
OFFICER Just got word.
OFFICER Can we talk to you for a minute?
DAN WHITE Sure...
DAN WHITE Dan heads for his office.
OFFICER Downstairs.
OFFICER The Association meeting room...
OFFICER Harvey watches as Dan follows the officer down the stairs to an ASSOCIATION MEETING ROOM on the next floor.
OFFICER When the DOOR OPENS, Harvey sees SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES from the Police Department wearing somber expressions.
OFFICER It looks as if Dan is about to get REAMED OUT.
ACTUAL FOOTAGE: Channel 5 reporting from Dan White's street:
DAVID FOWLER (ON TV) Most people were surprised when Dan White quit last Friday citing financial difficulties.
DAVID FOWLER (ON TV) Now we've heard that White is asking for his Supervisor job back.
DAVID FOWLER (ON TV) But many say--
Harvey, watching on the small TV set in his office.
DAVID FOWLER (ON TV) --White gave up all of his political chits when he resigned without making any arrangements.
DAVID FOWLER (ON TV) The news story transitions in the B.G. as Harvey gets up.
The city of San Francisco is in disbelief.
Four-hundred bodies have been found thus far in Jonestown, Guyana.
Leader of the People's Temple, Jim Jones...
Harvey heads to Dan's office.
He toys with the nameplate.
Something bittersweet lingers.
He walks in.
HARVEY'S POV: On City Hall's lawn, Dan is with the press.
He looks up, seeing Harvey in his office window.
They make eye contact.
It bears all the awkwardness of a relationship lost.
Something's snapped.
With adolescent frustration in evidence, Dan is with his wife, the press and a few supporters.
DAN WHITE It was a major decision on Friday that I had to come...
DAN WHITE to arrive at.
DAN WHITE But since that time, people unknown to me, plus my family and friends, have come to me and stated that they want me to stay in office, that they support me...
DAN WHITE So I'm asking the Mayor to let me stay in office to serve the people...
Harvey is firm, his hands planted on the Mayor's desk.
HARVEY MILK He gets dragged into a closed door meeting with the Police Officers Association, and comes out demanding his job back?
HARVEY MILK What do you think they promised him?
HARVEY MILK Or worse, how did they threaten him?
MAYOR MOSCONE A man has the right to change his mind.
MAYOR MOSCONE Give me some peace.
HARVEY MILK How many of our propositions has Dan shut down?
HARVEY MILK We could finally settle this police desegregation nonsense.
HARVEY MILK Cement rent control.
HARVEY MILK It's his vote on this Board that stands in our way.
MAYOR MOSCONE I get it, Harvey.
MAYOR MOSCONE I've been lobbied all week.
MAYOR MOSCONE Enough.
HARVEY MILK Let me just remind you that you're up for re-election.
HARVEY MILK If you re- appoint Dan, you lose the gay vote.
HARVEY MILK They listen to me.
HARVEY MILK You won't get elected dog catcher.
MAYOR MOSCONE I'll make my decision on Monday.
MAYOR MOSCONE You know what you sounded like just now?
MAYOR MOSCONE Boss Tweed or Mayor Daly.
HARVEY MILK A "homosexual" with a bit of power...
HARVEY MILK rather scary isn't it, Mr.
HARVEY MILK Mayor?
HARVEY MILK OFF Harvey.
HARVEY MILK He's come a long way.
Harvey sits in a balcony seat of the filled, darkened opera house next to Brazilian opera star BIDU SAYAO, 76.
He's enraptured by a production of TOSCA.
ON STAGE IT'S "O Scarpia, we shall meet before God!" Refusing to be taken prisoner, Tosca jumps from the walls of the castle set to her death.
Mary Ann offers the phone to Dan.
Dan takes it.
DAN WHITE Yes.
DAN WHITE This is Dan White.
I'm Barbra Taylor from KCBS.
I'm interested in your reaction.
I've received information from the Mayor's office that you won't be getting your job back.
DAN WHITE I'm sorry.
DAN WHITE I don't know anything about that.
DAN WHITE Dan hangs up on her.
Harvey can't sleep.
He dials the phone.
He lets it ring and ring.
Finally, a voice picks up on the other line.
SCOTT SMITH Hello?
SCOTT SMITH REVEAL: Scott, half asleep.
HARVEY MILK Sorry to wake you up.
SCOTT SMITH What's wrong?
HARVEY MILK I went to the opera tonight.
HARVEY MILK Guess who my date was.
SCOTT SMITH Who?
HARVEY MILK Bidu Sayao herself.
HARVEY MILK She was in the first Puccini I ever saw.
HARVEY MILK The crowd went wild.
HARVEY MILK It was like I was young again, seeing my first live opera...
SCOTT SMITH If you go to the opera again, you should call me.
HARVEY MILK Really?
HARVEY MILK Scott gets out of bed, considers his words.
HARVEY MILK It's intimate.
SCOTT SMITH Yes.
SCOTT SMITH I'd go with you.
HARVEY MILK I'd like that.
HARVEY MILK Harvey is quiet, a rare moment of reflection.
HARVEY MILK An unexpected tear rolls down his cheek.
SCOTT SMITH Harvey?
HARVEY MILK Look out the window, the sun's coming up.
SCOTT SMITH It's late.
SCOTT SMITH You should get some sleep.
HARVEY MILK I don't want to miss it.
SCOTT SMITH Miss what?
HARVEY MILK This.
HARVEY MILK Harvey's single word answer means, "Life."
HARVEY MILK OFF Harvey: Neither wants to hang up the phone.
The sun rising in his own living room, Dan White has been up all night, too.
The coffee table is covered with coke cans and junk food wrappers.
Waiting for a MAN inside to turn away, Dan sneaks in through a side window at City Hall.
The man calls after him:
MAN Hey, wait a minute, Mr.--
DAN WHITE My aide was supposed to come down here and let me in the side door, but she never showed up.
MAN And you are?
DAN WHITE I'm Dan White.
DAN WHITE City Supervisor.
DAN WHITE We follow Dan down the hall and into the grand entry-way.
Harvey walks through City Hall's METAL DETECTORS.
He picks up his keys from the dish and heads up the grand staircase.
Like ships in the night, Harvey just misses Dan exiting the elevator.
Dan heads into Mayor Moscone's office.
With Dianne, Harvey is thrilled, rubbing it in.
HARVEY MILK Who's it gonna be?
HARVEY MILK Is he replacing Dan with that God Damned liberal lefty Don Horanzy?
HARVEY MILK That'll really shake up the Board, huh?
DIANNE FEINSTEIN All I know is that we're getting a new Supervisor today.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN If Dan shows up, just avoid him.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN We don't need a scene today, right Harvey?
HARVEY MILK Heaven forbid, Dianne.
The MAYOR'S SECRETARY sits at her desk.
Shouting can be heard from inside his office.
Moscone leads Dan White to the bar beside his office.
Dan is enraged.
Moscone lights a cigarette.
DAN WHITE You can't take this away from me!
DAN WHITE Moscone has his back turned, pouring them cocktails.
MAYOR MOSCONE The issue is what's fair, for the people of your district.
MAYOR MOSCONE Take some time off.
MAYOR MOSCONE Spend it with your family.
Moscone finishes pouring two cocktails, and turns to see Dan White brandishing his revolver.
Moscone's Secretary, and a WAITING MAN note the THREE DULL THUDS, not so different than a backfire.
The secretary looks out the window, concerned.
The waiting man checks his watch.
Still gripped in his hand, Moscone's cigarette burns a hole in his tie.
Dan walks past Dick Pabich, past Dianne's office.
Harvey's voice can be heard down the hall.
He sounds up-beat,
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) This time next year we're marching on Washington D.C. It'll look like Market and Castro, but with a million people.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Write that down.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Tell President Carter we're coming after him next.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) I'm going to deposit this.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) I'll be back in 20 minutes.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Dan arrives at Harvey's office door.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Harvey is with a FRIEND, preparing to leave, surprised to see Dan in his doorway.
DAN WHITE Say, Harve, can I see you for a minute?
HARVEY MILK Sure.
HARVEY MILK Dan walks Harvey down the hall to his old office.
Harvey walks in first.
Dan stays between Harvey and the door.
Dan closes it.
Harvey smiles, sensing something is off.
Dan draws his revolver.
Harvey raises his hand.
Dan Fires.
The bullet rips through Harvey's hand and down his arm.
HARVEY MILK Oh no...
HARVEY MILK N-- Dan Fires again, silencing Harvey's cry for help.
Harvey turns away.
Another bullet rips into his chest, and he falls to his knees, now facing the window.
He staggers toward it.
The moment is extended as we see Harvey's POV of the Opera House outside the window, and the Castro beyond it.
HOLD ON HARVEY, gazing out at his beloved city.
Dan puts his revolver to the back of Harvey's head.
HE FIRES.
And just like that, Harvey falls.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Last week I got a phone call--
Harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder...
HARVEY --from Altoona, Pennsylvania, and the voice was quite young, and the person said...
HARVEY "Thanks."
HARVEY You've got to elect gay people so that that young child and the thousands upon thousand like him know there's hope...
HARVEY hope for a better world...
Scott and Anne enter a sparsely attended memorial service.
Most of the seats are empty.
The speaker is unfamiliar, some appointed CITY OFFICIAL.
SCOTT SMITH Where is everybody?
SCOTT SMITH Didn't anyone give a damn?
Harvey speaking into the tape recorder.
HARVEY MILK I ask this...
HARVEY MILK If there should be an assassination, I would hope that five, ten, one hundred, a thousand would rise.
HARVEY MILK I would like to see every gay lawyer, every gay architect come out--
Walking back out onto the street, Anne and Scott turn to look down Market Street, the camera pans and drifts to reveal:
THOUSANDS of San Franciscans of every religion, nationality, sexuality, all of the familiar faces and many new ones...
THEY ALL MARCH SILENTLY up Market Street to the palace Harvey dreamed could be his own: City Hall.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) --If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) And that's all.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) I ask for the movement to continue.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Because it's not about personal gain, not about ego, not about power...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) it's about the "us's" out there.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Not only gays, but the Blacks, the Asians, the disabled, the seniors, the us's.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) Without hope, the us's give up-- As the thousands of mourners arrive at City Hall, they place their candles around the statue of Lincoln.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) --I know you cannot live on hope alone, but without it, life is not worth living.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) So you, and you, and you...
HARVEY MILK You gotta give em' hope...
HARVEY MILK you gotta give em' hope.
HARVEY MILK Harvey closes his note pad, puts down his pencil, and pushes stop on his recorder.
Push in on Castro Camera.
The sign still in the window, "We're Very Open."
