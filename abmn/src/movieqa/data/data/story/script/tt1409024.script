MEN IN BLACK 3
Written by
Etan Cohen & Lowell Cunningham
Standard issue throughout the south to abusive, racist prison guards.
Widen to reveal that, indeed, these glasses are on the sneering face of just such a man.
We follow the guard
Paint peeling off the rusty bars.
Somewhere, someone is playing harmonica.
Prisoners yell complaints as he passes.
He meets them all with--
GUARD Shut up, convict!
GUARD Get yer hands off the bars!
The guard passes through several levels of security doors, deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison -- home of the scum of the scum.
Meanwhile...
The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read magazines, watch TV.
Footsteps -- someone's here.
Which pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do their jobs.
The unseen visitor buzzes for help.
They take their time getting off their asses.
When they finally look up, their gaze becomes a leer.
Follow it to: DEVIL GIRL, the visitor.
Too tall, too muscled, but hot if you're into that kind of thing -- an R. Crumb drawing come to life.
She holds a CAKE -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook.
GUARD 2 Lookie here.
GUARD 2 Yaz's visitor.
GUARD 2 I guess even a turd gets flies to land on it.
GUARD 3 Me, I like a big girl.
2. They smirk, hoping for a reaction.
2. Devil girl emits a low, sinister growl like an angry Doberman...
2. The guards look at
each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS:
GUARD 2 I.D., visitation papers.
He reaches the end of the hallway.
The biggest, most absurdly-reinforced double security door.
He punches in a code.
The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it squeaking and groaning the whole way.
Whoever's behind this thing must've done something REAL bad.
Going through the metal detectors, waved over with security wands.
The guards are being thorough.
Maybe more thorough than they need to be.
They check everything -- even the cake.
The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED.
GUARD 3 She's clean.
GUARD 3 Well, not CLEAN, but you know.
GUARD 3 They laugh, buzz her through.
The giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the hallway.
Stops in front of a cell.
Yells in:
GUARD Hey, Yaz!
GUARD You got a visitor.
GUARD Let's go, pretty boy.
Spare.
Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured concrete.
Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face of a guard.
The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks like they're not taking chances.
At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake.
She hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HER
YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider.
A huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a grubby unshaven face...
Everything about him seems strangely independently alive -- every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the way Elvis was in his prime.
He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING.
A smirk plays on his mouth that says -- I'm smarter than you, asshole.
The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and MANACLES.
They dump him into one of the chairs.
Devil Girl jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long.
A guard pokes them with his billy club --
GUARD 2 This ain't a conjugal visit.
GUARD 2 quit yer conjugating.
YAZ When's the last time you conjugated anything?
DEVIL GIRL I brought you a cake.
YAZ Thanks, darling.
Hey could you cut this up for us?
It's our anniversary.
I'm romantic like that.
A guard picks up the cake.
Smirks and takes a dirty three- fingered scoop of frosting.
Not great.
She must.be good at somethin' else.
They all LAUGH.
He goes back for another scoop.
YAZ I wouldn't do that.
GUARD 2 Why's that, convict?
Where he scraped away the frosting, REVEAL A HORRIBLE ALIEN
But in a flash, the mouth SPRINGS OUT -- IT BELONGS TO A VORACIOUS ALIEN -- another springs out behind it -- they consume the guard's entire face.
YAZ That's why.
YAZ The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as their master, snarling and hungry for blood.
YAZ The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER.-- he launches his aliens, taking them all out.
YAZ Yaz "holsters" the aliens and...
One guard, badly wounded, crawls to SOUND THE ALARM In the reflection of a pair of blood-spattered aviator glasses -- Devil Girl puts the guard down with his own weapon.
She uses one of the cake-aliens like a saw to get Yaz out of his chains.
YAZ There's nothing sexier than a girl killing for me.
She runs a hand over his bicep.
DEVIL GIRL You got so strong in prison.
Yaz notices the almost-dead guard:
YAZ I'm not just a man of brute force, you know.
YAZ I prefer to be known for my rapier wit-- His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier -- impaling the guard--
--and tongue.
The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl KISS.
They collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to saw open the door.
Prisoners go nuts, guards scramble -- smoke, screaming, chaos.
Yaz and Devil Girl, armed with weapons they took off the dead guards, BLAST THEIR WAY OUT.
He's a sociopathic badass...
and she's no slouch either.
Along the way, Yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs an armload of weapons -- Shotguns, pistols, and a Rocket- Propelled grenade (RPG).
He uses and discards them as he goes.
They head for the front gate and FREEDOM...
But..
They turn the corner and find 50 GUARDS in FULL RIOT GEAR -- Plexiglass shields, helmets, shotguns -- all aimed at Yaz.
All Yaz has left is his RPG.
Give it up, Yaz!
There's no way out!
A beat of stand-off -- Yaz and Devil girl facing off against the 50 Guards...
No one blinking...
Prisoners.
watching...
what's gonna go down?
GUARD You can't win.
GUARD You've only got one shot in there!
GUARD Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it.
GUARD The guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear.
YAZ You look hot.
YAZ Mind if I open a window?
The guards share a look - huh??
Yaz grins, turns his RPG towards the wall behind the guards.
The guards' faces go
GUARD Hey!
GUARD Whoa!
GUARD What are you doing?
GUARD Don't do that!
Yaz blasts a hole in the wall -- the guards are IMMEDIATELY SUCKED OUT like from a hole blown in an airplane.
What the...?
Yaz steps through the hole.
As he and Devil girl step through the hole, take a deep, satisfied breath of FREEDOM.
Reveal we are on...
The signage on the prison reads INTERGALACTIC DEPARTMENT OF
Yaz looks up at the BLUE MARBLE OF EARTH, smiles.
As Yaz fixes his gaze on our planet, his hair, his fringes INDEPENDENTLY ARTICULATE YAZ'S MALEVOLENT EMOTIONS...
they also seem drawn here.
Like bees, they express a collective intelligence.
YAZ I'm coming for you...
YAZ Following Yaz's gaze to the Earth, we launch into...
MiB credits fly us through the Galaxy.
Ending on a PARTICULARLY INHOSPITABLE LOOKING PLANET As it revolves, we observe its strange craters and surface, where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases...
When you really think about it, the universe is a pretty awful place.
Full of danger, brutality, and ten million kinds of scum.
So the trick is to find one or two things that make life in this cesspool worth living.
And reveal we are actually looking at...
Rotating on a spit.
JAY and KAY watch this awful duck rotate.
JAY That?
JAY That nasty, greasy thing makes your life worth living?
JAY There's people eating here, younger than that duck.
KAY I was talking about the noodles.
KAY Best noodles in town.
KAY And we are in
Tanks everywhere filled with strange fish.
An eclectic NY crowd eats -- Wall Street guys, hipsters, a Chinese family or two, a couple of NYU professor types who love the "authenticity" of this place.
KAY flashes a badge to the OWNER, Chinese.
KAY Good evening, Mr. Wu.
MR. WU (heavily accented, barely
Kay, Jay...
So happy see you...
Mr.
Wu get you regular table...
KAY Not so fast, Wu.
KAY We'd like to take a look in the tanks.
MR. WU Yes, you see, very fresh.
JAY The tanks in the back, Wu.
MR. WU Oh...
MR. WU so sorry...
MR. WU please no English, you come back later...
JAY Hey, save the chop socky bullshit for the locals, Wu.
JAY We need to see the kitchen.
Why are you busting my balls, Jay?
KAY Jay, take a look at this.
KAY Wu protests, Jay blows by him.
KAY So this is what you're passing off as tuna?
KAY Reveal a giant tank holding a HUGE ALIEN FISH.
JAY Wow, I didn't think there was anything uglier than a catfish.
JAY Jay taps on the glass -- the fish SNARLS, making Jay JUMP.
KAY Ugly AND a clear violation of Health ordinance 32, selling
foodstuffs.
MR. WU That's an earth fish.
MR. WU Very traditional from China.
MR. WU You arrest me, that's hate crime.
MR. WU They turn their stares on him.
KAY I guess it would be.
KAY If you were Chinese!
KAY Reveal -- from the waist down, Wu has the BODY OF A SLUG.
MR. WU C'mon, I got larvae to feed.
MR. WU And earth fish is so expensive.
MR. WU This is the only way I could stay afloat.
JAY Look, Wu.
JAY You can serve it to your...
JAY out of town guests, but locals get earth fish.
JAY REAL earth fish.
JAY The kind that doesn't jump out of their stomach and get everyone asking a lot of annoying questions.
JAY Like, "Why is my lunch eating Daddy?" You got it?
JAY DAMN, that's ugly.
MR. WU Yeah, yeah, thanks guys.
KAY Aren't you forgetting something?
Wu walks them to a table, seats them.
MR. WU Allow me most honorable benefit of get you noodles.
Be right back, guys.
Wu walks off.
Jay CLOCKS the other diners.
JAY Something about this strike you as weird?
KAY Yeah, look -- clean fork.
JAY Look at table two over there.
JAY They haven't ordered a thing.
JAY When's the last time Wu let someone sit at a table without ordering?
JAY And table five over there just drank his third cup of duck sauce.
JAY Now Kay's radar is up --
KAY Come to think of it...
KAY Why is Wu getting our noodles...
KAY outside?
JAY Because it's about to go down.
JAY Wu, at the door, closes the blinds.
JAY He catches them looking.
MR. WU Sorry, guys.
MR. WU Wu leaves, quickly pulling the door behind, him.
MR. WU The guys reach for their weapons.
MR. WU And IT GOES DOWN -- It's a SET-UP, and everyone in the restaurant is in on it -- The hipsters, the families, the wall street guys -- all draw various forms of ALIEN WEAPONS and ATTACK It's like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping truckloads of ordnance at each other.
MR. WU Close hand-to-hand combat.
MR. WU Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and they're not taking any chances.
MR. WU Right ahead of the onslaught, JAY GIVES KAY A HAND SIGNAL -- He nods, and they dive in opposite directions, SAVING
But not for long...
An explosive lands between them -- Kay gets BLOWN OUT THE FRONT WINDOW, rolls to a stop in the middle of the
Silhouetted at the top of the block -- a biker on a motorcycle.
As he pulls into the light -- YAZI
Kay's eyes go wide with recognition.
Yaz grins a murderous grin...
YAZ Some things are worth waiting for.
KAY Then come get it, you worthless
Yaz guns the engine and BEARS DOWN ON KAY.
Getting the worst of it.
A messy battle THROUGH THE KITCHEN.
The Giant fish's tank gets shot -- the FISH IS FREE!
And he goes RIGHT AFTER JAY!
JAY You probably took that whole catfish thing the wrong way -- The fish SNARLS AFTER HIM -- lunges and BITES!
JAY (CONT'D) I was jealous, you know?
JAY (CONT'D) Because you're so pretty!
JAY (CONT'D) Jay BATTLES THE FISH-- throwing pots and pans in its mouth, squirting hot sauce -- working like a lion tamer to keep it
JAY (CONT'D) Kay!
JAY (CONT'D) KAY!!!
JAY (CONT'D) Little help!
JAY (CONT'D) Little help!
Yaz getting closer.
He pulls out a CANNON of a gun, fires into the air.
YAZ This time you don't have your friends to tell you what happens next.
KAY Oh, I know what happens next.
Kay draws his EQUALLY BADASS-LOOKING WEAPON --
KAY (CONT'D) I've been waiting forty years for another shot at you, scum.
KAY (CONT'D) Kay takes aim and...
KAY (CONT'D) CLICK!
KAY (CONT'D) Empty.
GUN (V.0.) Your weapon is empty!
GUN (V.0.) Please recharge!
KAY Damn!
GUN (V.0.) Sorry you're having trouble!
GUN (V.0.) If you survive this encounter, please call customer service at-- Kay throws the gun at Yaz.
GUN (V.0.) Yaz laughs.
GUN (V.0.) Gets Kay in his sights.
YAZ All I wanted was justice, Kay.
YAZ Justice for my brothers.
YAZ But you had to meddle, didn't you?
KAY They deserved what they got.
YAZ Why don't you say that to their faces when you see them...
YAZ Puts the barrel in Kay's face and BOOM!!!
YAZ Yaz goes up in a GIANT EXPLOSION!!
YAZ Reveal Jay, just fired the shot.
YAZ Jay looks like total hell, beaten up, covered with 8 kinds of slime and alien guts.
YAZ He stumbles over to Kay, who in contrast looks perfectly pressed.
JAY So I was thinking about making a chart for each time I save your ass.
JAY And when I do it ten times, you buy me lunch.
Kay lets out a long, weary sigh.
KAY Will you settle for a drink?
Kay reaches behind the counter for a couple of beers.
Jay is on his phone.
We're gonna need a cleanup on the corner of Canal and Mott.
And bring a net.
Biggest one you've got.
Follow Jay's gaze -- the giant fish flops its way down Canal.
Jay and Kay back in their booth, Jay grabs a couple noodles off another table and starts eating.
Through the scene, various MiB clean-up crew people work the crime scene.
Why aren't you eating?
So what the hell was that guy?
Kay's quiet.
Ominously quiet.
Weighing his words:
KAY Yaz.
KAY Put him away a long time ago.
KAY Biggest mistake I ever made.
JAY Why?
JAY Was he the wrong guy?
KAY No.
KAY Should've killed him.
JAY Yeah, well, don't worry, I think I took care of him.
KAY That was too easy.
JAY I make it look easy.
JAY That's the problem with being my partner.
You get used to my game.
It's what Dr. Phil would call taking for granted.
KAY You don't get it, hoss.
KAY This guy is different.
KAY Worse than anyone.
KAY He tried to blow up the Earth but I stopped him.
KAY He developed a dislike for me and for certain behaviors of mine, such as being alive.
JAY C'mon, you know better {than anyone.
JAY What does an MiB agent call it when 12 alien species try to kill him?
JAY Tuesday.
JAY Jay laughs at his own joke.
JAY Kay just stares.
KAY Maybe.
KAY (calling off to cleanup
Make sure you get all of him, I mean it!
He's an assembler!
CLEANUP GUY Yes, sir, Agent Kay.
JAY Seriously, man, those noodles'll kill you before he does.
JAY I got your back.
KAY I know you do.
Stares at his noodles a while, like there's answers in there:
KAY (CONT'D) I used to play a game with my daddy.
KAY (CONT'D) What would you want for your last meal.
KAY (CONT'D) Could do worse than this.
JAY Oh, yeah?
JAY I used to play a game with my dad, too.
JAY Called catch.
JAY I'd throw the ball, and then it'd hit the house `cause he WASN'T
KAY Do me a favor, don't badmouth your old man.
JAY Hard to badmouth someone you don't know.
Alright, forget it.
The past is the past.
And right now we have something much more important to talk about.
Bowling Night.
KAY I'm tired.
JAY Tired?
JAY What -- you afraid I'm gonna take that MVP trophy away from you?
KAY Petrified.
KAY See you later.
KAY Kay takes a few tired steps and turns back --
KAY (CONT'D) And slick?
KAY (CONT'D) Watch yourself.
KAY (CONT'D) A guy like Yaz can come after you when you least expect it.
KAY (CONT'D) Anywhere, anytime.
KAY (CONT'D) Jay watches Kay walk away.
KAY (CONT'D) Looks like he's carrying a heavy
load.
Turns his attention to the clean up crew:
KAY (CONT'D) What part of clean up everything don't you understand?
KAY (CONT'D) There's a spleen on that car!
CLEANUP GUY On it, sir.
A glow of a cigarette illuminates the face of...
Devil Girl!
She reaches down.
We see -- a finger with the distinctive Skull, inching its way along the road.
DEVIL GIRL You okay, baby?
DEVIL GIRL Momma's got you.
DEVIL GIRL now.
Jay at his desk -- papers and folders everywhere -- SEARCHING
We see what he's looking through -- KAY'S OLD CASE FILES.
JAY Yaz...
JAY Yaz...
JAY Yaz...
JAY Where are you, Yaz...?
JAY And he FINDS IT!
JAY (CONT'D) Here we go...
JAY (CONT'D) Jay opens the YAZ INCIDENT REPORT
- Pictures of Yaz - A type-written report telling us YAZ APPREHENDED BY AGENT
- Farther down on the page, a CASUALTY REPORT: ONE
ZED Ready to bring the pain?
ZED Reveal Zed in his ridiculous bowling outfit.
A sign says: CLOSED FOR LEAGUE NIGHT We follow a couple normal-looking BOWLERS into
Safely inside, the Bowlers remove their heads -- which become their bowling balls.
It's the LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME -- ALIENS VS.
MIB AGENTS MiB agents and aliens say hi, exchange trash-talk.
We see shots of games in progress: An alien rolls a ball -- when it gets to the end of the lane, it sticks out arms, taking down all the pins.
The aliens cheer, slap tentacles, clink beers and swallow them whole.
A many-armed alien re-sets the pins.
A giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul line...
and -- gutter ball!
He gets mad and shoots the pins with his laser-eyes.
We end up with JAY AND THE MIB TEAM, NOT BOWLING BECAUSE
Zed paces, wearing way too much bowling regalia.
ZED Where's Kay?
ZED We either roll or forfeit -- and I didn't put this on to forfeit!
JAY Alright, Bowling Robot, do what we built you for.
JAY Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those white trash T-shirts that reads "10 reasons why Bowling is better than Women."
This is my time to shine.
Robot fires a ball directly down into the floor.
An awkward beat as we hear the ball puncture four floors.
Then a car alarm.
There goes my perfect game.
Ha ha ha.
JAY Guess it's on me.
JAY Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches, willing it towards the pins -- which SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY!
JAY But Jay's roll is too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- a
Jay and his teammates triumphant!
The frame of a lifetime!
Jay looks around --
JAY (CONT'D) Of course -- the one time Kay isn't here...
Jay enters -- looks a little worse for wear, like somebody who did some celebrating last night.
We see why -- when he hoists his GIANT, RIDICULOUS MIB
JAY Check it out-- The trophy raises a triumphant fist -- we realize it is in fact AN ALIEN.
We're number one!
In your face!
Suck it!
JAY Look who's league MVP.
GUARD Big surprise, you win every year.
GUARD That's weird...
JAY I...
JAY huh?
Jay, in a good mood, flaunts his trophy to everyone in the office.
The trophy continues its stream of obnoxious trash talk.
JAY Where are you, Kay?
JAY I think you want to see this.
JAY It's the bowling MVP trophy with MY name on it.
JAY Jay works his way to his desk.
JAY Kay's already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his work, his back to Jay.
JAY (CONT'D) Maybe you want to think twice next time you ditch me.
JAY (CONT'D) Kay, absorbed in work, doesn't answer.
JAY (CONT'D) Kay?
KAY Yeah?
JAY Yeah, I just wanted to show you this so I could say--
Who the hell are YOU???
Reveal -- CLINT EASTWOOD I'm agent Kay.
JAY You new around here?
Good one, partner.
JAY Yeah, okay, but I need the other Kay.
JAY You know, craggy old white guy...
JAY well, DIFFERENT craggy old white guy.
JAY I got you something.
JAY He hands over a "World's Best Partner" mug --
Have I told you today how much I appreciate working together?
JAY What the HELL is going on here?
JAY Why are you pretending to be Kay?
You seem upset.
Let's go get some coffee and talk about our feelings.
JAY How about instead, you go find me THIS guy?
JAY Jay opens the YAZ file and pulls out a picture of KAY.
JAY But
now, splashed across Kay's photo, the words:
Jay stares at the photo --- in it, we notice Kay is NOW
JAY (CONT'D) Killed?
JAY (CONT'D) In 1969?
JAY (CONT'D) Jay grabs the YAZ FILE -- the one he looked through last night -- but now everything is different.
JAY (CONT'D) We see -- the incident report stating ONE CASUALTY - AGENT
Jay can't believe it, he keeps reading...
Snatches of the typewritten incident report The casualty report
A photo of Kay WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION.
Jay stares, struck by this --
JAY (CONT'D) Kay's dead?
JAY (CONT'D) How?
JAY (CONT'D) Why?
JAY (CONT'D) The Men in Black Computer/Big Board sounds the alarm!
COMPUTER (V.0.) Attention.
COMPUTER (V.0.) Inbound missiles entering solar system!
COMPUTER (V.0.) Inbound missiles entering solar system!
Zed enters, chuckling at the warning:
ZED Well, must be a Tuesday.
ZED Okay, computer [twins].
ZED Give me a trajectory and an ETA on those puppies.
COMPUTER (V.0.) Running impact simulator...
COMPUTER (V.0.) Everyone watches as we see an animated simulation: the missiles smash into EARTH...
COMPUTER (V.0.) (CONT'D) Catastrophic Earth impact imminent.
ZED Damn.
ZED Welp, looks like we're all done for.
ZED Sorry, kid, it's been a good ride.
Jay remains calm:
JAY Whoa, what's everyone freaking out about?
JAY We had one of these last week.
JAY "Kay" hides under a desk, weeping.
We're all gonna die!
JAY Wait - what is everyone's problem?
JAY What about that pan-galactic missile shield thing?
ZED Sure, great idea, if we had one.
COMPUTER (V.0.) Now running pan-galactic shield simulation.
COMPUTER (V.0.) We see the missiles being shot down.
COMPUTER (V.0.) (CONT'D) Conclusion: 6.72 billion lives saved.
COMPUTER (V.0.) (CONT'D) With shield...
COMPUTER (V.0.) (CONT'D) without shield...
COMPUTER (V.0.) (CONT'D) Sorry to say I told you so.
ZED I wanted to build one years ago, but Kay talked me out of it.
JAY Kay talked you out of it?
JAY Kay wouldn't do that.
JAY He's the most distrustful person in the galaxy.
JAY He personally set up that system to defend our planet from the scum of the universe.
I thought we didn't have any enemies anymore.
A stranger's just a friend you haven't met.
JAY Yeah, that's working out great.
JAY Look, I don't know what's frying everyone's brains, but I remember the missile shield --- Kay -- the real Kay -- loved that thing.
JAY He wouldn't shut up about it.
JAY I mean, that thing was all Kay.
But Kay's dead.
He's been dead for years.
But I knew him yesterday.
Jay looks at the YAZ file.
Gears turning.
He grabs a picture of Yaz --
JAY (CONT'D) Where the hell did he.get an iPhone in 1969?
Peeking out of Yaz's jacket -- an iPhone.
Something clicks --
Kay said Yaz can get you anywhere, anytime.
Any TIME.
So Yaz killed Kay in 1969 and now there's no missile shield.
Jay realizes something and RUNS OFF
I love you, Jay!
JAY You're definitely not Kay!
He runs by people dealing with the world coming to an end:
COMPUTER (V.0.) Nine minutes to impact.
COMPUTER (V.0.) I always loved you, microwave...
On the microwave -- it beeps plaintively.
Jay runs off with purpose...
July in the city.
A perfect summer day.
Kids eat ice cream.
Old ladies head to matinees.
The streets of New York team with humanity, blissfully unaware that they are about to die.
In other words, a Tuesday.
Jay runs through Time Square, where guys sell stuff on blankets.
Desperately looking for someone...
Among the sellers, a suspicious-looking guy wearing a strange mixture of anachronistic clothing -- tri-cornered hat.
As soon as he sees Jay, his eyes go wide and HE FLEES.
Jay grabs something off the blanket and smacks him -- lays him out.
JAY Where you going in such a hurry, Obadiah?
JAY The past?
OBADIAH What are you talking about?
OBADIAH He throws his arms up, revealing a pocket watch and a telescope.
JAY I know you've been time-travelling.
OBADIAH No way, man.
OBADIAH I've just been here, totally legit, here in New Amsterdam.
OBADIAH I mean -- Manahatta ...
OBADIAH n I'm legit.
JAY Yeah?
JAY What's this?
JAY Reveal the thing he just hit him with -- a ship's bell with S.S.
JAY TITANIC on it.
OBADIAH I swear, I'm out of that.
OBADIAH That's my grandmother's.
JAY What else you got here?
OBADIAH Nothing, nothing man.
JAY Oh, yeah?
JAY Off a Dodo in a cage.
JAY (CONT'D) Is that a dodo bird?
OBADIAH Family pet.
JAY I think he'd be happier free.
JAY Jay frees the bird -- it runs, squawking...
OBADIAH Oh, come on, man!
JAY Interesting.
JAY Jay picks up Spider-Man 8 off the blanket.
JAY Featuring chubby, bald 50-year-old Tobey Maguire.
OBADIAH That's pirated, man.
OBADIAH That ain't nothing.
OBADIAH Jay rips open his jacket --
JAY And this?
JAY Reveal a copy of the Declaration of Independence..
OBADIAH Okay, okay, maybe I've been time travelling a little -- just for personal use, man, just enough to
JAY Listen -- I'll look the other way if you tell me who's selling time travel these days.
JAY I just want your supplier.
OBADIAH No way, man.
OBADIAH You don't mess with that guy.
OBADIAH He'll kill you, me, and then he'll go after our families!
JAY Don't worry, he won't have time.
OBADIAH What do you mean?
OBADIAH Jay forces the guy to look up-- we see the missiles.
JAY Those hit the sun in 8 minutes.
JAY You want to live out those minutes?
JAY Or you want me to take you out of your misery?
JAY Jay picks up an ancient weapon -- crossbow, blunderbuss -- off the blanket and puts it to the criminal's head.
OBADIAH Okay, okay, but don't say I didn't warn you, man.
OBADIAH You just signed your own death warrant.
JAY I just want a name.
OBADIAH Fine, but it's the last one you'll ever hear.
Think Michael Cera at his most geeky.
Hi, I'm Trevor!
Reveal -- we are in
And Trevor is an "Apple Genius"
TREVOR Do you have an appointment?
Well, if you don't have an appointment, you'll have to come back tomorrow.
JAY Yeah, well, the thing about tomorrow is, we'll all be busy being dead.
TREVOR Excuse me?
JAY Help me, or the world is gonna end.
TREVOR Everyone thinks their computer problem is the world coming to an end.
JAY Right.
JAY Take a look at this.
JAY Jay directs Cera's sightline to the sky--
TREVOR Ahhh!
TREVOR What is THAT?
JAY That, is We're all dead in...
JAY Seven
TREVOR Unless WHAT??
JAY You start sharing the illegal time travel tech you've been slinging.
Excuse me, can you tell me which one of these batteries is better?
The 10-hour or the 12--
JAY You only need seven minutes, get the cheap one.
JAY He grabs Trevor-
JAY (CONT'D) Where is it??
TREVOR Okay, okay, I'll show you.
TREVOR But this is incredibly powerful technology, so it must remain absolutely secret.
TREVOR Follow me.
Trevor LEAVES HIS POST --- Jay follows:
TREVOR (CONT'D) Absolutely secret, do you understand?
JAY Yes, but we're running out of time--
AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM Hey!
AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM Excuse me!
TREVOR With you in a second, ma'am.
AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM It'll only take a minute.
AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM You see, my nanny's phone number got erased from my favorites and I have to ask her what my daughter wants for her birthday.
AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM Jay takes the phone.
JAY Oh, I see the problem.
JAY He CHUCKS THE PHONE across the store, where it SMASHES TO PIECES.
JAY She leaves in a huff.
TREVOR I've always wanted to do that.
TREVOR okay, so here's what you do...
TREVOR Trevor pulls Jay in, ready to lay this top secret information on him...
TREVOR (CONT'D) Okay, so go to the clock app.
TREVOR (CONT'D) And shake it.
JAY That's it?
JAY Jay does it.
On the phone -- TIME TRAVEL BETA
TREVOR Now you just type in the year you want to travel to...
TREVOR On the phone -- it's "augmented reality" -- the image through the phone is the image of the targeted time period.
JAY Okay, thanks.
TREVOR Now listen.
TREVOR This is highly crucial: Time travel is nothing to mess with.
TREVOR You can't change anything, you can't use new technology or all of space-time can just -- kablooey!
Yeah, well, is it ok if I change
TREVOR Yeah.
TREVOR Right.
TREVOR Yeah, that's cool.
TREVOR Jay is about to "enter" time travel...
TREVOR (CONT'D) Wait -- hold on a second.
TREVOR (CONT'D) If you go -- I'm just gonna stay...
TREVOR (CONT'D) and be dead?
JAY Don't worry, I'll fix it.
JAY You'll only be dead for a little while.
JAY Jay DISSOLVES INTO A TIME TRAVEL EFFECT...
JAY Cera is left alone.
JAY The missiles get EVER CLOSER...
Trevor opens a "Voice Recorder" app:
Trevor's last words.
Dear posterity...
Should anyone find this, let history remember that Trevor was a man of noble bearing, quiet dignity --
And the world is vapor.
Pure white.
Jay comes to, groggy, like he has the worst hangover of all time, brain bigger than his skull, trying to make his eyes focus.
Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white environment -- Is this the afterlife?
The reverie disrupted by a TOILET FLUSH The white resolves into
Jay realizes he's in a men's room, sitting in a urinal.
The music transitions: Whatever hip-hop featuring a 60s sample was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s song itself, played over a tinny portable radio.
He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of one of the stalls, washes his hands...
and flips Jay a quarter.
Jay stares at it a beat, confused.
Misreading his confusion, the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter.
What the heck, you're doing a great job.
The kid leaves.
Jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in...
White guys on IBM Selectric typewriters as far as the eye can see -- like the office in the Apartment.
Jay stops in his tracks, taking in the 1969-ness of it all.
An officious guy, annoyed, runs up--
OFFICIOUS GUY You're late!
OFFICIOUS GUY Where's Mr. Watkins' lunch?
OFFICIOUS GUY Did his girl not put in the order?
OFFICIOUS GUY The officious guy glares at the "girl" -- in her 60s.
OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D) (shoves a bill in Jay's
Run down to Woolworth's -- Two hamburger sandwiches, fries, egg cream, and a pack of luckies.
If you're back in half an hour, you can keep the change.
Jay looks at the SINGLE DOLLAR BILL.
OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D) On the double, OK?
JAY Yeah.
JAY Jay's moves to the elevator, waits for it.
JAY Pockets the profits of the racist misunderstandings.
JAY Elevator opens, the elevator operator opens the door -- Jay climbs in with a car full of older executives.
JAY Jay shakes his head, just taking this all in.
JAY (CONT'D) Wow.
JAY (CONT'D) 1969.
JAY (CONT'D) You're all dead now.
JAY (CONT'D) Just as the elevator's about to close, a leggy blonde tosses him a set of keys.
The Big Man wants his caddy.
Chop- chop.
The doors close.
Jay's got the keys.
He looks at the parking tag, walks down a row of beautiful classic cars, looking for the right car -- stops and smiles.
Reveal Jay cruising in the most gorgeous 1964 Coupe deVille convertible.
Fins, chrome, a thing of beauty.
From the seat next to him -- a fedora.
He puts it on, completing the look.
In the background we notice the Leggy Blond getting yelled at by the guy who must be "The Big Man" Jay HONKS and waves -- thank you!
Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York.
A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS' "Can't Get Next to You" comes on the radio.
Jay is swept up in the music and soon is
At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian couple.
They give him a disapproving look.
The woman clutches her pearls just a little more protectively.
He smiles and leans towards them.
JAY Guess what?
JAY Black president!
JAY He laughs and drives off.
JAY Pulls up at...
EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING The secret entrance to MiB HQ, familiar from the first movie.
EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING Jay strides up to the entrance and...
EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING can't open the door.
EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING Bangs on the door -- nothing.
EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING Shaking the knob, calling to
the guard...
nothing.
From behind him:
Help you?
Look a little lost.
JAY Yeah, thanks, listen--
Jay turns and is face-to-face with two grinning Staten Island cops.
He instantly realizes what's about to go down.
Yeah, guess I knew this wasn't gonna be just people handing me money and Cadillacs.
COP 1 'Scuse me?
JAY Nothing, officer.
JAY I'll be on my way.
COP 2 That's an awful nice car.
JAY Thanks.
COP 1 Kind of work you do, individual of your particular...
COP 1 ethnic persuasion...
COP 1 to buy a car like that?
COP 2 Wouldn't be anything illegal, would it?
COP 1 You an athlete or something?
JAY Yeah, I'm the North American champion of kiss my ass.
The cop loses his smile, turns to his partner:
COP 1 That sound like resisting arrest to you?
COP 2 Sure did.
COP 2 They grab him, start to frisk him --
Well, well.
Boy, you're gonna have a little problem explaining THIS.
The cop holds up Jay's HIGH-TECH GUN -- the NOISY CRICKET and his NEURALIZER.
A BLACK CROWN VIC SCREECHES UP between the cops and JAY.
Out steps KAY -- but 40+ years younger.
KAY I'll take it from here.
Who the hell are you?
KAY Agent Kay, Division 2, special...
KAY .black ops.
KAY Thank you for your cooperation, if I could ask you to look here for a moment -- Kay pulls out what looks like a NEURALIZER -- and swiftly beats each one over the head -- it's just a BLACKJACK -- they crumple.
JAY Kay?
JAY Kay, is that you?
JAY Oh, man it's good to see you, buddy!
JAY Jay hugs Kay -- who remains stony-faced.
JAY Jay gets a little choked up to see his friend alive -- Kay is a rock.
JAY (CONT'D) Look at you, all...
JAY (CONT'D) sort-of- young...
JAY (CONT'D) Kay!
KAY That's got to be the first time an unregistered alien caught sneaking onto Earth was happy to see me.
KAY Jay pulls away, realizing--
JAY Oh!
JAY You think -- aw,that's funny.
JAY No, it's not like that.
JAY You see, I'm your partner.
KAY If I had a partner I'd know it.
JAY There's a simple explanation for that.
KAY I'm all ears.
JAY You see I'm your partner...
JAY (knows he's about to sound
In the future.
And I came back to save you.
A longdry stare.
KAY Well, thank you very much.
Hey, no problem, man.
I got you--
KAY Yeah, thought I'd heard them all.
KAY Usually, they offer a great gift to the people of Earth in exchange for refuge.
KAY Time-travelling partner from the future -- that's some extra-credit right there, and I do appreciate you bringing some much- needed variety to what can be a very dull job.
KAY But I'm still gonna have to bring you in.
JAY Yeah, ok, I know it sounds a little-
KAY It sounds a LOT--
JAY That's why I'm going to prove it to you...
JAY Because if I weren't from the future, would I know about -- your little top-secret headquarters right HERE??
JAY He tries to force the door open.
JAY Nothing.
JAY (CONT'D) I said -- HERE?
Jay finally kicks the door open -- And inside...
we SEE...
An abandoned building, filled with spiders, etc.
JAY (CONT'D) Right.
JAY (CONT'D) Not here yet.
JAY (CONT'D) But it will be.
JAY (CONT'D) Gonna need to get rid of the raccoons and bats and stuff, but...
JAY (CONT'D) it'll be real nice.
JAY (CONT'D) Game room over there for your pinball, you love your pinball.
JAY (CONT'D) Lotta good times there -- I'm going for an extra ball, Jay!
JAY (CONT'D) you'd say.
JAY (CONT'D) And I'd be there.
JAY (CONT'D) With you.
JAY (CONT'D) Partners.
JAY (CONT'D) Long stare from Kay.
KAY Let's go.
KAY And word of advice -= I don't know what it's like on your planet, but around here, a guy with your...
KAY complexion in a car like that is gonna get some attention he doesn't want.
We hear the way-too-loud death-rattle exhaust note of what sounds like ten Harleys at once.
Reveal -- Yaz, the nightmare biker, looking like Dennis Hopper meets Satan, riding a badass custom skull-themed rig that might have dropped out of the brain of Stanley Mouse.
His skull ring gleams on his pinkie.
Devil Girl sits behind him, hands on his shoulders.
We ride with them a beat, tearing down the highway...
They STOP AT A LIGHT -- even with a brightly-painted microbus full of hippies.
One of the hippies leans out --
Hey, you guys like to party?
Care to make a trade for the mama?
Yaz pulls out his alien "guns."
The stoned hippie smiles serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths.
Makes a peace sign.
Make love, not war.
Yaz "fires" the alien -- it launches into the microbus -- followed by its brother.
The microbus rocks, hippies scream, the bus dents from the inside-out.
On a bumper sticker: If This Van's a-rockin', don't come a knockin'.
The guns, finished, return to Yaz.
Yaz surveys the carnage, picks up a medallion off one of the hippies.
But looking at it more closely, frowns and throws it away.
The head back on their way...
Blood drips over the Ass, Gas or Grass bumper sticker...
We dissolve from the blood to a deep red STRAWBERRY SUNDAE.
Widen to reveal we are in...
A great NYC automat...
The kind of place you go when you like to be alone.
Loners and weirdos populate the tables, minding their own business.
Immigrants read foreign papers.
Jay follows Kay as they walk by the glorious deco machines offering pies...
pastries.., beverages...
JAY Is this your favorite place?
JAY Makes.
JAY sense.
JAY Zero human interaction.
JAY Kay ignores him.
JAY (CONT'D) So how old are you?
KAY Twenty-six.
JAY Really?
JAY Wow, you got some city miles on you.
JAY Jay laughs.
JAY Kay ignores him, stops in front of a machine offering "SPECIALS".
JAY Jay grabs a paper off a nearby table: We see headlines about Nixon, Vietnam, the Apollo Launch.
Jay looks at the date: July 14, 1969.
JAY (CONT'D) The fourteenth.
JAY (CONT'D) Then we have two days.
JAY (CONT'D) Kay really takes his time, picking out the right sandwich.
JAY (CONT'D) Hey, look, I know your lunch is important, but like I said, we only have two days here.
KAY Here we go...
KAY Kay puts some money in the machine -- is about to make his selection.
KAY Jay reacts to it -- GROSS!
KAY We see -- the most unappealing ham sandwich ever.
KAY The meat is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy.
KAY No one in their right mind would buy this sandwich.
JAY No way, man.
JAY I am not letting you eat that.
JAY I didn't come all the way here to have you die before I can tell you-- Kay reaches for the button.
JAY Jay slaps his hand away.
JAY A BEAT of undignified hand-slap-fighting--
JAY (CONT'D) No way, man.
JAY (CONT'D) No way the world ends because you had to eat that thing-- Kay SUCCEEDS IN HITTING THE BUTTON and
A SECRET DOOR instantly spins them around and Jay and Kay are
INT. MIB 1969 HQ A cloud of smoke...
INT. MIB 1969 HQ It clears and reveals Mid-century futurism with a martini lunch office vibe.
INT. MIB 1969 HQ It's how Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury would have imagined the MiB offices.
The cloud of smoke comes from everyone smoking.
Aliens run around with ashtrays, cocktail shakers and cigarettes.
The alien smokers smoke from surprising orifices.
The !liB agents have the feel of ivy league privilege.
Very male and very white.
Women are there to be secretaries and eye candy.
Two many-armed aliens stock the automat.
Kay tosses one the sandwich, it goes right back into the automat.
Jay recognizes the aliens -- it's the twins!
JAY Hey!
JAY [long alien name] and Bob!
JAY Don't worry, you guys get a big promotion in, like, 20 years.
JAY Kay takes Jay down an escalator.
JAY Quick atmospheric
establishing shots of MiB '69: - A wall of Black and White TVs monitoring the aliens of the times: Castro...
Yoko...
Hendrix...
- A cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very high-tech camera.
Reveal they're using it to watch a secretary's ass.
She gets wise, turns -- they raise their martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible!
- Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool.
- Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go clean something up.
- An MiB barbershop quartet practices.
The men in blaaaaaaack...
Jay can't help laughing --
JAY What planet are they from?
KAY The Hamptons.
KAY Let's go somewhere we can talk.
JAY Finally.
Typical interrogation room table in the middle.
Kay pulls out a giant form -- it looks like 10 tax returns stacked together.
He fits sheets of carbon between the pages.
JAY Oh, we're gonna do the forms now.
JAY Listen, Kay, I know you're gonna do what you're gonna do, but we're burning time here.
JAY When I got here, you had 48 hours.
JAY Now you've got 46.
KAY Name, planet of origin and Galactic
JAY My name is Agent Jay, you gave it to me.
"Subject uncooperative."
Purpose of visit?
JAY To save the Earth.
Kay looks at the form, there's a number of options to check: "Create a new race...
Steal Earth women...
Offer life of eternal youth...
vacation...
Save the Earth."
He checks the box.
KAY Save the Earth...
KAY Congratulations, you're the third one today...
KAY Maybe you'll get a balloon.
JAY Fine, don't believe me.
JAY But just listen to what I have to say, because it's going to save your life and the life of everyone in this galaxy.
JAY It hangs in the air...
KAY Are you currently pregnant or preparing to spawn?
JAY There's a killer out there.
JAY Goes by "Yaz."
JAY He's coming for you.
JAY You told me your one regret was not killing him when you had the chance.
KAY Never heard of any Yaz.
JAY You will.
JAY Here's what to look for.
JAY Long hair, leather, looks kind of like a biker.
JAY You'll know him from the skull ring on his pinky.
JAY He's trying to blow up the Earth and you get in his way somehow so he kills you.
JAY This Friday.
JAY In Florida.
JAY So, if you want to live -- do not go to Florida.
KAY Florida?
KAY I hate Florida.
KAY I hate everything South of Virginia.
KAY If that's what you came to tell me, you're wasting your time.
JAY Man, you're as stubborn as you always were.
JAY I mean -- always will be.
JAY Look, It's not just about you.
JAY Because he kills you, you don't live long enough to build the defense shield.
JAY And without a defense shield, the Earth gets destroyed.
JAY You get it?
JAY He kills you, the Earth gets destroyed.
JAY I have to save you from him so we can save the planet.
JAY Kay stops writing.
KAY Huh.
KAY Well.
KAY This is finally starting to make sense.
KAY Jay looks hopeful.
KAY (CONT'D) Because you're crazy.
KAY (CONT'D) Paranoia.
KAY (CONT'D) Delusions of self-importance--
Agent Kay!
Door BANGS OPEN -- in walks THE BOSS MAN...
and it sure isn't ZED.
AGENT EX, flanked by junior agent underlings.
EX is a well- tanned WASPy jackass with a room-temperature IQ who probably got this job from his daddy's country club connections.
He's good at tennis and not thrilled about this whole "civil rights" fad.
Kay stands.
KAY Hey, chief.
EX Heard you got a mooner in here.
EX Don't take all day.
EX We're not here to babysit them, just figure out where he's from and send him back.
KAY Actually, still trying to sort it out.
KAY He says he's human.
EX Fortunately, we have the technology here to test for that.
EX Ex steps up close to Jay.
EX Looks him over.
EX Then SWIFTLY
EX (CONT'D) Gag reflex.
EX (CONT'D) Coughing.
EX (CONT'D) Eyes watering.
EX (CONT'D) Human.
EX (CONT'D) Code 43 him.
KAY Got it, chief.
Kay walks Jay.
JAY So what's code 43?
They pass through a set of double doors.
Tilt up to reveal:
ON JAY AND KAY Jay reacts to whatever he's looking at.
KAY This little baby here is called a Neuralizer.
KAY REVEAL -- The 1969 Neuralizer fills an entire room.
KAY And we
It's manned by 60s labcoat technicians with sliderules and punchcards.
The Neuralizer itself is a piece of 60s-tech-glory -- magnets, tubes, things that look like they belong in Dr.
Frankenstein's lab.
JAY Whoa, whoa, what?
JAY You're gonna neuralize ME?
JAY You can't neuralize me.
JAY Haven't you been listening?
JAY Two ALIEN ORDERLIES grab Jay.
KAY Have a lay down, stretch.
KAY The orderlies force Jay on a sort of gurney -- in the '69 Neuralizer, the "patient" is fed through the machine, like for an MRI.
JAY You erase what's in here, you erase the whole world.
KAY Don't worry.
KAY When it's over, you'll forget all about this Yaz and Florida and the end of the world.
KAY I think it'll be good for you.
KAY Calm you down.
JAY I don't need to calm down.
KAY Don't worry, it's safe.
KAY We even tested it on one of our own men.
KAY Kay indicates Q, who wanders around like he's been lobotomized.
KAY (CONT'D) Hey, Agent Q!
Q waves back:
Hey, agent Q!
KAY No, YOU'RE -- forget it.
KAY We're still.., fine-tuning it.
KAY okay, strap him down.
KAY TWO BIG-ASS ALIEN ORDERLIES force Jay down.
KAY A TECH flips the machine ON -- TUBES POWER UP WITH HUGE NOISE
Jay struggles as he gets closer and closer to the machine.
Jay manages to slide his key fob out of his'pocket -- uses the edge to flip open the clamp on the straps -- and HE'S
TECH How the hell-- Kay smiles -- Not bad, kid.
TECH The orderlies rush him -- Jay knocks them out.
TECH The scientists are fraidy-cats -- they hide.
TECH It's down to Jay and Kay.
KAY Nice moves.
KAY You'd make a good agent.
JAY I AM a good agent!
JAY Kay takes a SWING at Jay -- Jay dodges it easily.
JAY (CONT'D) That's right, you always lead with your left.
Kay pulls his weapon -- Jay ducks behind the Neuralizer -- now Kay can't shoot.
KAY You're just making it worse for yourself.
KAY The following plays over a game of CAT AND MOUSE around the giant structure of the Neuralizer -- like through the stacks in a library.
KAY (CONT'D) There's nowhere to run, slim.
KAY (CONT'D) It's just if we're gonna do it easy or do it hard.
KAY (CONT'D) Jay runs into a dead end.
KAY (CONT'D) Kay and the orderlies are on him.
KAY (CONT'D) The pissed-off orderlies grab him roughly, force him onto the gurney.
KAY (CONT'D) Jay keeps flailing.
JAY I know you, Kay, I can prove it...
You love to bowl!
KAY Bowling is enjoyed by more than 95 million people in more than 90 countries.
KAY You gotta do better than that.
JAY You've got a scar on the back of your right hand!
JAY Jay grabs Kay's hand.
JAY They LOCK EYES for a moment.
JAY Kay lets Jay flip his hand over, big build-up, REVEALING...
JAY .no scar.
JAY (CONT'D) Damn.
JAY (CONT'D) You will!
JAY (CONT'D) I swear!
JAY (CONT'D) Kay signals -- the Neuralizer powers up.
JAY (CONT'D) And Jay is on the conveyor belt into the machine.
JAY (CONT'D) This is all about to be over.
JAY (CONT'D) Jay thinks desperately for a way out, THEN-- Eureka!!
JAY (CONT'D) Kay!
JAY (CONT'D) KAY!!!
JAY (CONT'D) What about your girl on Martha's Vineyard?
Kay looks up.
Jay sees an opening:
JAY (CONT'D) You chose the job over her -- but you never stopped thinking about her.
JAY (CONT'D) You can't forget her.
JAY (CONT'D) Kay grabs him.
KAY How the hell do you know that?
KAY I've never told anyone that.
KAY A long look at this guy, who somehow knows things he shouldn't.
KAY And he hits the POWER OFF BUTTON...
KAY But this being TUBE TECHNOLOGY -- we stay with JAY'S TERRIFYING POV -- as he slides through the claustrophobic Neuralizer chamber -- the tubes powering down just in time, inches away from him.
KAY Jay crawls out of the Neuralizer, shaken.
JAY You see, Kay?
JAY It's me-- But Kay grabs him and puts a gun on him--
KAY If you're gonna drag her into this, you'd better be able to back up your story.
KAY Because if you're jerking me around, I'll make a window out of your head.
JAY Yeah, okay, um -- according to the file, he should have entered Earth- space in the last couple days.
JAY Did you spot any unauthorized landings in the last 48 hours?
JAY Kay looks to a tech, who looks at a clipboard --
TECH We did have something -- a landing in New Jersey.
TECH Kay and Jay look at each other.
Alright, you're coming with me.
Jay grabs his key chain.
JAY Can I ask how you're planning on getting me out of here?
INT. MIB 1969 HQ Kay leads a "LOBOTOMIZED" Jay through HQ.
KAY 'Scuse me, boys.
KAY Just did a code 43 on this one.
JAY How's it going, fellas?
JAY Look, I put on my pants.
JAY He feels one of the agent's faces.
JAY Kay leads him to the exit.
JAY He talks to Jay as if Jay is a
dim 3rd-grader who speaks little English:
KAY You are a tourist from Kansas.
KAY A city slicker took your wallet at the bus station...
KAY Kay leads Jay to a SET OF DOORS MARKED "EXIT to STREET" --
KAY (CONT'D) Two out.
KAY (CONT'D) The agents nod to Kay and WAVE HIM THROUGH-THE EXIT...
KAY (CONT'D) Which deposits them in...
The peepshow megaplex from the bad old days of time square.
A creepy pervert sits in a booth.
Puts money into the machine.
The wall SLIDES UP -- and to his surprise, instead of a peepshow...
Jay and Kay climb out.
Off the creep's reaction:
JAY Aww.
JAY Did I spoil the mood?
On the New Jersey State Parkway --
KAY You'd better not be wasting my time-
JAY Yeah, yeah.
JAY Window out of my head.
JAY But hey -- if I don't save you, I'm dead anyway.
JAY So do what you want to me -- just make sure you watch out for yourself.
JAY They pull up to...
A squat shack on the edge of a dump, home office to a "legitimate local business."
The windows are bloodied and broken from the inside.
Corpses of wiseguys litter the front of the building, all showing disturbing spore growth.
[please see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuKjBIBBALS for reference] The corpses DEMATERIALIZE and disappear.
JAY This doesn't look like a mob hit.
KAY That's a hell of an observation.
KAY What gave it away?
JAY Spores.
JAY Dematerializing corpses.
JAY And THAT.
JAY Jay points beyond the building...
JAY a SHEER DROP Which is the edge of a HUGE SMOKING CRATER -- And how did this crater get here?
In the center, a GIANT ROCKET, all chrome and Flash Gordon.
It formed the crater on landing.
KAY We're going in.
KAY Kay draws his weapon.
JAY Aren't you gonna give me a.gun?
KAY Right.
KAY He pulls out a Smith and Wesson, dumps the bullets, and hands it over.
KAY (CONT'D) Try not to get in my way.
JAY You try not to get in MY way.
JAY Jay and Kay move towards the building...
JAY BAM!
JAY BAM!
JAY BAM!!
JAY Someone's firing at them -- they dive for cover.
JAY More GUNSHOTS -- Jay gives Kay THE SIGNAL, WE SAW IN THE CHINESE RESTAURANT
KAY What the hell is that?
JAY Stay behind me.
JAY You need to stay alive.
KAY The hell I will.
KAY Jay tries to go in -- Kay pushes him out of the way and goes in first.
Jay and Kay bust in -- almost fall into the room because they're squabbling over who's first -- Then - BAM!
Someone's hiding under a desk, holding a gun over his head, firing randomly.
Kay gets GRAZED -- They dive for cover.
Kay's right hand is bleeding.
JAY Huh.
JAY So that's how you got the scar.
JAY Jay tosses his EMPTY GUN into the corner -- the guy under the desk fires FIVE TIMES - EMPTYING HIS GUN!
JAY Jay sprints at him, flips the table -- it's a terrified, quivering WISEGUY.
JAY Jay grabs him and DISARMS HIM.
JAY The guy is FREAKED OUT.
JAY What'd he look like?
JAY Pull it together!
JAY Jay SLAPS THE GUY.
JAY (CONT'D) The guy who did this --- what'd he look like?
WISEGUY Looked like a biker...
WISEGUY And he had a...
WISEGUY He had a skull ring...
WISEGUY Jay and Kay share a look.
JAY That's him.
Walking up to Kay's car.
In the background, MiB puts up a facade around the rocket -- "Rocket Waste Disposal", techs take samples.
JAY What about the witness?
JAY We don't have time to take him back to HQ to
KAY We've got something new.
KAY Portable Neuralizer.
KAY With a rumbling and BLASTS OF AIRHORNS, 18-wheelers drive up, housing the "portable" Neuralizer.
KAY (CONT'D) Can you believe how small these things are getting?
JAY Yeah.
KAY Okay, slick.
KAY I'm making a decision to believe you.
KAY Not because I do, but because I have to, you get me?
KAY He walks to the trunk, pops it open.
KAY He flips a switch, revealing a HIDDEN ARSENAL.
KAY He grabs a COOL GUN and gives it to Jay.
KAY Jay admires the
JAY Aw, this means you like me, doesn't it?
KAY Let's go get this sunovabitch.
KAY They climb in but -- SCREECH!!!
KAY A Crown Vic swerves to a stop in front of them.
KAY Out pops an
EX Kay!
EX Don't move a goddamn muscle!
EX I have you on 12 protocol violations!
EX Kay looks to Jay.
KAY Make it thirteen.
KAY He GUNS IT -- THEY TEAR OFF...

Yaz approaches the tollbooth, manned by a gruff NY no-BS, no- time for anyone TOLLBOOTH COLLECTOR.
TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER Exact change only.
YAZ Can you help a stranger, please?
TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER Oh, sure.
TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER That's what I'm here for.
TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER You see that thing behind you?
TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER That's New Jersey.
TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER Go home and get some change.
YAZ There's been a great injustice in the Universe.
YAZ I must make it right.
TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER You know what's also a great injustice?
TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER Sitting in this box all day listening to people try to get out of paying the toll.
YAZ Let me ease your pain.
YAZ On Yaz's evil grin...
KAY Now tell me everything you know about this Yaz scumbag.
JAY In two days he's gonna kill you in Florida.
KAY Two days.
KAY Doesn't give me a lot of time.
KAY You couldn't have come back a week ago?
JAY Sorry, I was distracted by the Earth blowing up.
KAY So we have two days to kill him before he kills me.
KAY Alright, there's one cesspool everyone washes up in sooner or later.
KAY Someone'll know something there.
KAY Come on.
KAY Let's take a drive to Alien Town.
JAY Alien Town?
JAY They drive under a sign indicating: EAST VILLAGE
Cruising through NY.
Devil Girl on the seat behind him.
He pulls even with a patrol car.
YAZ Excuse me, officers of the law.
YAZ Like you, I care a great deal.
YAZ about justice and I'm looking for some people.
YAZ Maybe you can help me.
OFFICER Okay -- get a shave and a haircut..
OFFICER They laugh.
OFFICER Yaz smiles sadly.
YAZ Have you ever lost someone close to you?
YAZ I have.
YAZ I've lost everyone.
YAZ Everyone except them.
YAZ Can you help me find them?
YAZ He gives the cops a picture, they take it grudgingly -- we see it: a half dozen hippies wearing medallions.
YAZ The cops look at each other and raise eyebrows.
OFFICER Only one part of town where people like that hang out...
The historic Village landmark.
Jay and Kay approach...
60s freaks eyeball the squares...
Jay and Kay ride to the sixth floor.
JAY There's gotta be something that connects you to Yaz.
JAY What cases are you working on?
KAY Well, I'got this whole dry ice thing.
JAY Dry ice?
JAY What's that?
JAY Someone get killed over some dry ice?
JAY Smuggling something in some dry ice?
KAY No.
KAY We just can't figure out what it is.
JAY Wow, you're pretty low on the totem pole, aren't you?
JAY The great Kay, looking for dry ice.
KAY Don't push your luck.
KAY The doors open, and we're in...
Kay's on the hunt for someone.
They weave their way through the far-out types, hear snippets of high-60s party conversations.
Someone notices Jay's suit --
What are you, a time traveller?
That suit is SO five years ago.
Kay sees who he's looking for, grabs him:
KAY We need to talk.
KAY Reveal ANDY WARHOL -- and this is the Factory, and this is one of Warhols' famous parties.
KAY Draped on Warhol -- a bunch of strange hangers-on, his "stars."
Yum, pigs are getting cute.
Jay smiles -- she looks skeeved out.
I meant the young one.
Warhol speaks with his strange -- yes, almost alien -- affect.
WARHOL It's not really a good time to talk.
WARHOL I'm creating a party.
WARHOL But...
WARHOL Maybe if he asks me.
JAY What - me?
WARHOL I would never say no to anything that came out of that beautiful mouth...
WARHOL Jay is visibly uncomfortable.
WARHOL Kay nudges Jay - do it.
JAY [Grumbles about what he has to do for his partner].
JAY We need to talk.
JAY Please.
JAY Warhol and his Stars ooh and ahh over Jay.
JAY Someone snaps a picture.
WARHOL Amazing, just amazing.
WARHOL Alright, you talked me into it.
WARHOL Follow me.
Be back soon, stars.
From here, a window looks out over the whole scene.
Warhol leads the guys in, shuts the door and LOCKS IT.
Immediately, his ENTIRE AFFECT CHANGES -- he rips off his WIG, lights a cigarette, and talks like a hard-nosed cop.
WARHOL Damnit, Kay, are you TRYING to blow my cover?
KAY Take it easy agent W, your cover is perfectly safe.
WARHOL Perfectly safe?
WARHOL Are you out of your goddamned mind?
WARHOL It's only a matter of time before they figure out I'm a total fraud.
KAY Cool your jets--
WARHOL I'm so out of ideas I'm painting bananas and soup cans for chrissakes.
WARHOL How long do you really think they're gonna keep buying this shit?
WARHOL Warhol slumps on a chair.
WARHOL (CONT'D) I can't take it anymore.
WARHOL (CONT'D) Talking to these nutjobs and all these goddamn hippies.
WARHOL (CONT'D) God, I hate hippies.
WARHOL (CONT'D) They're just filthy, Kay.
KAY Yeah, I know they are, buddy.
KAY But you're doing good work here.
KAY We need you.
KAY A knock at the door -- Warhol gets back into character --
WARHOL I'll be right there...
WARHOL I'm just...
WARHOL filming these men eating a hamburger...
WARHOL It's...
WARHOL transcendent.
WARHOL Okay, now the pickle...
WARHOL You see what I mean?
WARHOL And who the hell's this guy?
WARHOL New partner?
JAY Actually, I'm his old partner.
JAY I came from the future to warn him
WARHOL Jesus, fine, don't tell me.
WARHOL Alright, what do you need?
JAY We're looking for a recent arrival.
JAY Long hair, wears a lot of leather...
JAY Warhol indicates the party below -- half the guests match that description.
WARHOL You'll have to do better than that.
WARHOL Look, if that's all you have, I can't help you.
KAY Maybe you know someone who's seen something.
Andy, the horse is here...
WARHOL I gotta get back in there--
JAY Hold up -- the guy we're looking for -- he's out to destroy the world.
WARHOL C'mon, what's new?
WARHOL What does an MiE call it when someone tries to destroy the world?
WARHOL Tuesday.
JAY I thought you made that up.
KAY C'mon, W, I got a feeling on this one.
KAY Like we should take it serious.
KAY And we don't have much time.
KAY Jay checks his watch.
JAY 33 hours.
WARHOL Yeah, yeah, alright.
Okay, talk to Prell and Vidal.
C'mon.
ON TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - in very 60s fashion with incredibly giant hair - one with a big afro, one with big chignon hairdo.
WARHOL Vidal, Prell, can you please talk to these nice men?
WARHOL The women's LIPS DON'T MOVE -- they respond in incongruously
PRELL Whadaya want?
VIDAL They look like cops to me.
VIDAL ain't talking.
PRELL We're not rats.
PRELL We swing around them to REVEAL that Warhol/Kay/Jay are not talking to the women's faces -- They're STANDING BEHIND THE WOMEN -- TALKING TO THEIR HAIR- DO'S which we realize are two COMPLETE HAIR ALIENS, VIDAL and PRELL, perched atop these women.
KAY Start talking, you two, before you end up on a barber's floor.
PRELL Ah, you don't scare me.
KAY Yeah?
KAY Kay reaches into a passing woman's purse, pulls out HAIRSPRAY.
KAY Grab some of Prell and holds up the spray.
PRELL You wouldn't!
PRELL He sprays the hair, it starts to SCREAM IN PAIN.
VIDAL Stop, you bastard!
PRELL I'm telling you, we don't know anything!
KAY You wanna play tough?
KAY How about we take a ride to the barber college, see how tough you are?
KAY Kay keeps shaking them down, but Jay is distracted...
KAY On Jay...
KAY something is making him think...
KAY A sound...
KAY it.
KAY grows louder...
KAY we start to be able to make out the distinct bip...
KAY bip...
KAY bip...
KAY of PONG Jay FOLLOWS THE SOUND...
KAY To a group of people -- that incredible Factory mix from slumming socialites to Black Panthers to the freakiest freaks...
KAY They surround a SKANKY GUY -- and whatever they're watching on TV is so mesmerizing it's like they're seeing the face of God...
It's too beautiful.
Someone takes a picture of the screen.
Jay walks around the TV -- REVEAL: They're watching CLASSIC EARLY 70S PONG.
The SKANKY GUY controls it via a BIG MEDALLION hooked up to the TV antennae terminals.
He's playing against a young clean-cut square.
Jay grabs the wires and rips them out, cutting off the game.
Everyone JEERS him.
ON KAY, hearing the noise, turns to see what's going on.
SKANKY GUY What the hell, man?
JAY Just wondering where you got that.
SKANKY GUY Your mother.
SKANKY GUY The crowd laughs.
JAY Really.
JAY So my mother gave you a technology that hasn't been
Jay grabs him by the throat.
Partygoers react.
Someone takes pictures.
Someone claps in delight.
JAY (CONT'D) Now how about you tell me where you really got it?
JAY (CONT'D) The skanky guy knows he's in trouble.
SKANKY GUY Oh...
SKANKY GUY uh...
SKANKY GUY okay, no hassles, man...
SKANKY GUY I got it from that dude over there...
SKANKY GUY With the beard.
SKANKY GUY Jay turns, lets go just long enough for the guy to LEAP OUT
Jay takes off after him -- Kay joins And the CHASE IS ON
Jay and Kay chase the guy through various 60s locations - a commune, an ashram, a folk club, a protest.
Everywhere they are mistaken for "pigs" - people get in their way.
To Jay's surprise, young Kay is a hell of a runner, in incredible shape.
It gets competitive between them...
Until Jay can't keep up -- Kay takes off...
Kay runs the Skanky Guy down - Jay huffs and puffs his way over, grabs the medallion.
JAY Alright, one more time.
JAY Where'd you get this?
SKANKY GUY It was a gift--
JAY Bullshit.
JAY Kay puts a gun on him.
JAY (CONT'D) Oh, hey.
JAY (CONT'D) This is my partner.
JAY (CONT'D) He's about to get fired for excessive violence and he doesn't have much left to lose.
SKANKY GUY I borrowed it!
SKANKY GUY CLICK!
SKANKY GUY Kay cocks the gun.
I stole it, okay?
JAY That's what I like.
JAY A nice, honest thief.
JAY Stole it from who?
SKANKY GUY They don't even care, man.
SKANKY GUY They leave their money everywhere.
JAY Who?
SKANKY GUY I don't know who they are--
KAY Then you're not worth much to us, are you?
KAY The gun comes back out.
SKANKY GUY I heard they were Archanans.
JAY Archanans?
JAY They're pretty far out of their neighborhood.
JAY I didn't think we'd ever had one on Earth before.
SKANKY GUY I can tell you where they live!
SKANKY GUY Southwest corner of 3rd and Avenue C.
SKANKY GUY Top floor.
SKANKY GUY Apartment 12.
SKANKY GUY Jay rips the medallion off his neck.
Ow!
JAY I'll do a lot worse.
JAY Get the hell out of here.
JAY The guy runs off.
KAY What's the deal with the necklace?
JAY You were wearing one just like it when you died.
JAY Come on.
Jay and Kay pull up in front of the building.
KAY That address.
KAY It's familiar.
KAY He pulls out a notebook.
KAY (CONT'D) I was going to come by here tomorrow to check out a lead on the dry ice case.
JAY So you come here tomorrow, get tangled up with these Archanans...
JAY And...
KAY And Yaz kills me?
JAY Something like that.
JAY So do me and the people of Earth a favor and be careful.
KAY Aw, put on your big girl panties and let's go.
JAY Hey, I've always got my big girl panties on.
JAY Huh.
JAY That didn't sound right.
Jay and Kay ride up...
KAY That thing back at the party, what was it?
KAY Some kind of game?
JAY Not just any game, PONG.
JAY Game of kings.
JAY But it wasn't invented until 1974.
KAY How do you know that?
JAY Because I was the only kid on my block who didn't have one.
KAY Aw, what's the matter?
KAY Daddy didn't buy you the toy you wanted?
JAY Didn't have a daddy to not buy me toys.
JAY Here's the only thing I ever got from him-- He holds up his key chain.
KAY That's rough.
JAY It gets worse.
JAY You're the closest thing I have to a dad.
Jay and Kay move carefully, ready for trouble.
They get to the door -- Apartment 12.
Jay points to the door -- THIS IS IT!
They see -- THE DOOR IS SMASHED IN, PUNCHED OFF ITS HINGES And punched into the door -- THE IMPRESSION OF A SKULL RING
JAY That's from Yaz's ring.
JAY He was here.
JAY Or is here.
JAY Jay SIGNALS KAY
KAY Why do you keep doing that?
They move into the room on high alert...
But it's empty.
They realize the strangeness of the room - alien technology (including a TV hooked up to something strange with tons of wires hanging out) and lots of money..
LOTS of money...
Not just piles -- the actual furniture is MADE OF STACKS OF MONEY.
They've been using it for scrap paper, for napkins.
JAY So Yaz was never after you...
JAY he was after the Archanans.
JAY You just got in the way.
KAY Which must make them damn important.
KAY But what does he want with them?
JAY 'No sign of struggle.
JAY They must've cleared out before he got here.
JAY Like they knew he was coming.
KAY And he's probably on their trail now.
KAY But where the hell did they go?
KAY They look around, puzzling over this place.
KAY Jay picks up a $100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money.
JAY Think this might tell us something?
On the $100 bill: A strange series of words and numbers: 3 2...
5 1...
7 5..
KAY Looks like some kind of code.
KAY We'll take it to HQ, run it through the computer.
KAY Figure out where they went.
Jay and Kay walk down the dark hallway -- Yaz steps out of the shadows --
Jay and Kay head back to HQ.
Kay drives, Jay stares at the $100 bill, squinting at it, turning it over --
JAY How about bible verses?
JAY Coordinates?
JAY Airplane flights?
JAY Shoe sizes?
KAY So this is how you do it in the future, huh?
KAY You just keep guessing until you figure it out?
Phone numbers!
They stop at a light.
Suddenly -- WHAM!
WHAM!
Someone FRANTICALLY POUNDS on the trunk -- a frightened 12-year-old prostitute wearing what is basically Jodi Foster's Taxi Driver hooker costume -- hotpants, mary janes, halter top.
There's something familiar about her face...
HOT PANTS GIRL For God's sake!
HOT PANTS GIRL Help me, would you?
HOT PANTS GIRL There's some maniac after me -
JAY Slow down -- who's after you?
HOT PANTS GIRL He was like nothing I ever saw -- crazy eyes, and this freaky skull ring.
Jay and Kay look at each other:
JAY Get in.
HOT PANTS GIRL Thank you so much.
HOT PANTS GIRL This is a dangerous city for a girl.
HOT PANTS GIRL The light turns green -- we're on the girl's face.
HOT PANTS GIRL Jay and Kay looking straight ahead.
JAY So where can we take you?
HOT PANTS GIRL Just make a left up here.
HOT PANTS GIRL Kay does it...
HOT PANTS GIRL There's a rushing noise...
HOT PANTS GIRL In the back seat, Hot Pants Girl IS "INFLATING" AND BECOMING
The car turns down a dark, deserted alley.
JAY Are you sure?
JAY Seems dangerous.
DEVIL GIRL Not for me.
DEVIL GIRL Reveal -- the girl has fully "inflated" into her natural form -- DEVIL GIRL!
DEVIL GIRL The outfit is grotesque on her.
SET PIECE FIGHT in the car.
Employing cool MiB tech built into the car.
Devil Girl subdued, locked into the trunk in a "CONTAINMENT SACK" -- like what you'd use to stuff a raccoon into.
The fight's over, the guys slump against the car.
JAY What the hell was that?
KAY I don't know, but I'd bet you two to one Yaz sent her.
KAY Beat.
KAY Light bulb moment for Jay --
JAY Say that again!
KAY I think Yaz sent her.
JAY No, the whole thing!
KAY I'd bet you two to one Yaz sent her.
KAY On Jay, realizing-- He grabs the $100 bill --
JAY I know where they are!
ON JAY AND KAY Walking -- we hear sounds of crowds, of cheering, REVEAL we
JAY How are we going to find them?
JAY Any idea what an Archanan looks like?
JAY And then -- they see --
A circle of what looks like Tibetan monks -- colorful, playful, dressed in robes.
They could only be -- the Archanans.
The group comprises one older Archanan -- the LAMA -- and three younger ATTENDANTS.
KAY I think I found them.
KAY They step into
Within the space around the Archanans, the chaos and noise of the crowd melts away.
Deflected.
There are three Archanans and one distinctive older one --
In the middle -- a giant pile of winnings.
All is peaceful within this space.
Faint chimes.
They greet Jay and Kay happily, chant a strange mantra:
King Lady Big Trouble Classy...
The faint sound of an announcer:
Results for the sixth race: King, Sweet Sophie, Big Trouble and Red Gent!
Superba pays 3200 to one...
JAY You're in danger--
ARCHANANS You're in danger...
ARCHANANS you're in danger...
Jay thinks they're playing the "echo game" like little kids:
JAY Very cute, but--
LAMA In eight seconds, please do us the kindness of ducking.
JAY Huh?
KAY Yaz!
KAY They turn to see YAZ -- he levels a WEAPON AT THEM -- FIRES!
KAY Jay and Kay DUCK -- the weapon just misses.
JAY Thanks.
KAY Let's get into trouble.
KAY Jay and Kay engage him -- As they run off, the Lama calls --
LAMA Remember, please, to take the bridge.
LAMA And we begin
Try to include motorcycle and horse elements.
Could also involve the actual aqueduct, which is close by.
At one point, Jay and Kay seem stuck, they remember...
JAY Take the bridge...
JAY They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz.
JAY At one point, Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz BLASTS HIM -- Jay is knocked down.
JAY Looks DEAD!
JAY But he shakes it off reveal the PONG medallion blocked the shot.
JAY Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz compressed into .a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of a garbage truck.
JAY The guys give chase -- they want him captured, but no luck.
JAY The truck drives off...
KAY He's gone.
JAY Only a matter of time before he comes back.
JAY And this time he might be really mad.
Jay and Kay return to an EMPTY RACE TRACK...
It's like a ghost town.
No Archanans to be found...
JAY Damn, we lost them.
JAY They come all the way across the universe and just when we're about to figure out what all of this is about-- Then, faintly...
JAY a CHEER
KAY Hold that thought.
KAY They follow it out to
Which is empty.
No spectators, no horses.
Just the Archanans...
Who stand near the track watching...
nothing.
And yet -- They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race ever.
Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell?" Look and approach them.
JAY Everybody OK?
ARCHANANS Everybody is everybody.
JAY Yeah...
JAY guess I can't argue with that.
JAY So listen up -- Yaz is down but he won't be for long, so we need to start coming up with some answers.
JAY First of all-- The Archanans CHEER.
JAY Jay shakes it off.
The Archanans CHEER AGAIN.
JAY (CONT'D) What are you cheering about?!
ARCHANANS The races.
ARCHANANS Jay and Kay keep approaching...
ARCHANANS Puzzled -- the track is empty...
JAY What races?
JAY Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura...
JAY and now-- The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHING
JAY (CONT'D) Where are we?
We are tomorrow.
Jay steps backwards, out of the aura -- back to empty ghost town.
Steps back in -- tomorrow's rabid fans, cheering the race.
From the Archanans' POV -- we see ALL VERSIONS/ALL AGES OF
The effect is -- THEY SEE ALL TIME AT ONCE.
JAY You...
JAY can see the future.
LAMA It is what you call the future.
ATTENDANT Ah, the future.
ATTENDANT An illusion of the time-bound, borne of the fallacy that one moment follows another.
LAMA Yaz suffers from this greatly.
LAMA And so he must have revenge on your planet.
JAY Revenge?, For what?
LAMA He mourns the past because he can not see the dead are still as alive as they ever were.
LAMA Just not now.
JAY Okay, someday you're gonna explain that to me, but right now you need to stop the riddles because there's about two minutes until Yaz crawls out of his hole and gets back to trying to kill you.
JAY So help me out.
JAY I need to know IN ENGLISH why Yaz is trying to kill you and what that has to do with saving the Earth.
ATTENDANT We know what he will know.
JAY You know what...
JAY he will know...
JAY You know his plans.
And you're going to stop him.
He wants to kill you because you stop him.
Yes, if he does not kill us first.
KAY Don't you know if he's going to?
LAMA Sometimes he kills us, sometimes he does not.
LAMA There are many futures.
JAY Okay, which future is the one where you live and the Earth doesn't blow up?
LAMA The one where you take us home.
LAMA Jay and Kay exchange a look --
KAY Alright, let's get these freaks home, and pronto.
LAMA You must let go of your.
LAMA attachment to time, beginning with your concept of "pronto."
LAMA And on that -- THUP THUP THUP -- 12 Blacked-out helicopters...
Illegal aliens -- you are surrounded...
Do not attempt to flee...
Jay and Kay YELL INTO THE BACKWASH OF THE ROTORS:
JAY No!
JAY We need to get them home!
JAY But it's all drowned out in the wind and dust...
JAY MiB "squad cars" -- pull up and surround them.
JAY Jay and Kay look for an escape route -- but MiB cars and trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere.
JAY MiB agents descend on ropes, round up the Archanans--
Agent Kay!
Return to your vehicle!
Rendezvous at headquarters in 20 minutes!
We will escort you by air!
And from the noise and chaos of the choppers...
To silence...
Jay and Kay watch through a glass wall.
Inside the conference room -- the Archanans sit around a table.
Ex paces, clearly talking ABOUT the Archanans to the other agents.
Body language tells us the MiB reach some kind of consensus.
Ex comes out -- Jay and Kay hop up.
Ex notices Jay for the first time --
EX What's he doing here?
EX Didn't we just bust you?
KAY That was someone else.
KAY All these mooners look alike, right?
KAY A beat -- and Ex buys it completely.
EX Yeah...
EX So look.
EX We've talked about it.
EX And you are to be commended, Agent Kay.
EX You did a fine job bringing these illegals in.
EX Now it's our job to get them out of the city for containment.
EX Somewhere where if someone decides to blow them off the map, the collateral damage will be insignificant.
EX Toronto.
KAY But they're in danger.
KAY One of the most dangerous beings in the universe is out to kill them--
KAY And if that happens, we're all going with them, because they're our only hope of survival.
EX Christ, if we listened to every Mooner who showed up telling us how they were gonna save the world, that's all we'd do.
EX Do you know why Earth is still standing?
EX (CONT'D) Why we're not a smoldering chunk of nothing?
EX (CONT'D) Because we don't stick our nose into other people's business.
EX (CONT'D) Especially people in danger, because they have enemies, and those enemies destroy Earth.
EX (CONT'D) Now.
EX (CONT'D) Are you going to execute my order or not?
I thought we were supposed to be the good guys.
EX Careful, Agent Kay.
EX That sounds like insubordination.
EX Kay walks up to Ex, looks him DEAD IN THE EYE
KAY It sounds like you need to cut some eyeholes in your stomach, because your head is so far up your ass, that's the only way you could possibly see.
EX That's it.
EX You're off this case.
EX Stick to dry ice.
EX If I catch you near them -- or him -- again, I'll have your badge.
EX (to a bunch of other
You four -- take the Archanans to transpo.
One of the agents looks up--
YOUNG AGENT Me?
YOUNG AGENT I'm just an accountant---
EX Go!!!
And you...
You just get out of here!
The MiB agents GRAB the Archanans and hustle them out.
Kay leans in to them--
KAY Don't worry, we'll--
LAMA Yes, we know.
LAMA Kay looks up -- sees Jay smiling at him.
KAY What?
JAY I knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna lie down.
JAY So what's the plan?
KAY You heard the man.
KAY We've got dry ice to investigate.
It's the truck that "compacted" Yaz.
We follow it to the
Where the truck dumps its load...
Including YAZ...
Who gets PROCESSED AND PRESSED INTO A CUBE.
On the cube -- it begins to swell and force itself back into its natural shape.
Around the piles of garbage, other Yaz parts SEEK EACH OTHER
Workers stop what they're doing -- get out of the way of something, disturbed.
We see Yaz and understand the reaction -- Yaz might be back together, but NOT AT ALL RIGHT -- a leg stuck in the wrong place, the head at a weird angle.
He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself...
Pops out an eye, swaps an arm...
He unfurls his tongue, smells the air --
YAZ Where did you go...
A SLEAZY GUY is suprised to see not just an agent...
but four agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his peep show window.
One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him:
You will die alone.
Yeah, I know.
The agents lead the Archanans through the world's greatest emporium of sleaze.
The hustle and bustle -- cabs picking up and dropping off
We find a LONG LINE OF UNHAPPY KIDS, MAKING UNHAPPY PARENTS -- Kids crying, pulling on Mom's dress...
We see -- it's the line to an ICE CREAM TRUCK.
And the line isn't moving because KAY IS QUESTIONING THE
DRY ICE SMOKE rises from the freezer:
KAY Just a few more questions about dry ice and I'll be out of your hair...
KAY A BIRD CALL makes Kay turn --.he sees Jay waving him over, pointing at something -- The MiB agents lead the Archanans into the Station!
I told you ten times -- I got no idea what dry ice is!
KAY (not listening).
KAY Thanks, you've been very helpful.
KAY Jay and Kay peel off, follow the MiB agents, leaving the Vendor scratching his head.
KAY He turns back to the kids.
KAY Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside...
The Men in Black blend in easily with the guys going home to Greenwich, but the Archanans are easy to spot.
Jay and Kay tail them -- and lose them for an instant!
They spot a glimpse of robe, run after them, turn a corner -- And it's just some Hare Krishnas.
KAY Damn.
KAY Wrong freaks.
KAY But Jay spots the Archanans...
JAY Over there, Kay!
JAY As they run off --
Perhaps you'd like to join us for a vegetarian meal?
Jay and Kay chase after the MiB agents and Archanans -- The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs warning WET PAINT!
The agents look around, then slip pass the ropes and through a NARROW DOOR marked "WET PAINT" or "MEN WORKING" Jay and Kay follow...
Through the skinny half-painted door...
An EQUALLY SKINNY ESCALATOR descends 100s of feet.
A problem: it's going the WRONG WAY -- bringing incognito aliens and MiB agents UP INTO GRAND CENTRAL.
Jay and Kay muscle their way down -- lots of 'scuse me -- pardon me -- hey, don't grab that!
But once they power past the crowds, Jay's jaw drops as we reveal...
A MUCH-BIGGER station under Grand Central, a secret hub for sending aliens back and forth all over the country.
It's basically a series of GIANT PNEUMATIC TUBES --people- sized versions of the vacuum tubes that used to beeverywhere in banks, offices, etc.
A mix of ALIENS and MIB AGENTS put on helmets and pads, board the tubes and FWOOP off...
Quick shots -- a shoeshine stand set up for many-limbed aliens...
a newsstand with strange papers...
The Beatles in line for Liverpool with a blue meanie...
Kareem Abdul- Jabbar...
KAY On your 2 o'clock.
KAY They spot the MiBers and the Archanans next to the TUBE TO
The MiB agents put helmets and pads on the Archanans.
They're about to load them into the tubes -- Jay and Kay approach:
KAY Hold up.
MIB You're off this case, Kay.
Yeah, but I heard there's some dry ice in Queens.
Magic show at a kid's birthday party.
Better hustle, you can get there before.
the cake.
They all LAUGH at Kay.
KAY Change in plans.
MIB What?
MIB We didn't hear about any change in plans.
KAY Yeah, Ex just gave us the new orders -- check this out -- Kay gestures them closer -- he reaches for something in his jacket pocket...
KAY The MiBers lean in...
KAY And Kay GRABS THEM AND SHOVES THEM BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE
The MiB agents stumble, surprised -- The Archanans, not surprised, step deftly out of the way, the MiBers FWOOP FWOOP FWOOP into the tube...
Jay and Kay exchange a smile and realize...
One last VERY YOUNG agent is still standing there, wide-eyed:
YOUNG AGENT Don't hurt me!
YOUNG AGENT I'm just the accountant!
He reaches for his radio...
Jay talks him down:
JAY I know you're a little freaked out and you want to call for backup, but listen: When you've done this job for a while, you realize there's one rule -- things aren't what they seem.
JAY These are innocent beings that need our protection.
JAY Are you gonna do the right thing or are you gonna be a company man and send them off to die in Toronto?
JAY The young agent thinks -- puts down the radio.
JAY (CONT'D) Good, good.
JAY (CONT'D) What's your name?
YOUNG AGENT Agent Zed, sir.
KAY You're gonna be okay, kid.
KAY Jay can't help laughing --
JAY He's gonna be better than OK.
JAY I'm not gonna give you so much shit anymore.
JAY The radio CRACKLES --
Zed, what's your status?
ZED Detainees are on the tube to Toronto.
ZED No sign of Kay.
ZED Over.
EX (V.0.) Copy that, good work, Zed.
EX (V.0.) Zed crosses off...
JAY Be nice to him.
JAY Trust me.
JAY Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup.
JAY (CONT'D) Okay, you all wanted to go home.
JAY (CONT'D) Well here we are.
JAY (CONT'D) So how do you want to get off this rock?
JAY (CONT'D) You guys have the spaceport on Long Island yet?
JAY (CONT'D) Kay just looks at him.
JAY (CONT'D) That place is a dump anyway.
JAY (CONT'D) Best Margaritas in the Universe, my ass.
JAY (CONT'D) What about the one in Ohio?
JAY (CONT'D) The Archanans smile.
ATTENDANT Here is the way home.
ATTENDANT The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and hands it to one of his attendants.
ATTENDANT The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT...
ATTENDANT it passes through all the attendants and then to JAY.
ATTENDANT Jay gives it a look.
JAY Here, huh?
JAY You're sure?
LAMA The only future that ends with life begins there.
JAY I'll take that as a strong "yes."
JAY Okay, then.
JAY Follow me.
JAY Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the terminal.
JAY Kay catches up --
KAY Where are we going?
KAY Jay looks at him a beat.
JAY Omaha.
JAY And I'm gonna buy you the biggest T-bone you ever saw when we get there.
JAY So -- you head over to the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help these guys over here for a second.
JAY But I'll meet you in a minute.
JAY By the Omaha tube.
JAY They stare at each other --
KAY Sounds good.
KAY See you there.
KAY Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card --
KAY (CONT'D) Omaha, my ass.
KAY (CONT'D) Kay looks at the card: GREETINGS FROM SUNNY FLORIDA -- a tourist post card with palm trees, oranges and beaches.
KAY (CONT'D) Let's go.
JAY No, no, no.
JAY No way.
JAY Florida, Kay.
KAY That's what it says.
JAY Don't you get it?
KAY Yeah, it's hot and muggy.
KAY The old people drive slow.
KAY (CONT'D) We'll stay somewhere air- conditioned and only drive after three when they're at dinner.
JAY This is why you were there.
JAY In Florida.
JAY Because of them.
JAY You were helping them and that's why...
JAY that's why you get killed.
JAY Today, July 16.
JAY I saw the report myself.
JAY Agent Kay, dead at the scene.
JAY Killed by Yaz.
KAY You know what an MiB agent calls it when he faces death?
KAY Besides I got you to watch my back, right?
KAY They walk to the FLORIDA TUBE
JAY I just want you to know, I'm doing this out of love, man.
KAY Doing what?
KAY He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM.
JAY You stay home and stay alive.
JAY But Kay isn't down.
KAY I told them I'd help them -- I'm honor-bound to do it.
KAY Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney.
KAY Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus.
KAY Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard.
JAY Damn, you used to have some abs.
They continue to pound each other.
As they trade punches:
JAY (CONT'D) I can't let you go to Florida.
KAY I make my own future!
KAY Besides -- I'm younger and stronger than you!
They both attempt an identical spin kick at the same time -- feet collide.
JAY Bet you're sorry you taught me that.
JAY The fight continues...
JAY They're wearing down, circling each other...
JAY And then Kay fakes a left ---
JAY (CONT'D) You always lead with your-- But this time Kay connects with his right, knocking Jay down hard.
KAY Had enough yet?
KAY On Jay -- gasping, spent -- using every last reserve of strength to lift himself off that floor.
JAY I can't let you go -- I love you!
JAY Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN.
JAY Kay LUNGES AT JAY.
JAY They CLINCH...
JAY it's a stalemate...
KAY Aw, hell, look at that-- behind you-
JAY I'm not falling for that.
KAY I'm not kidding -- Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see...
KAY The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the
Jay and Kay share a look -- and both run INTO THE TUBE!
Jay, Kay and the Archanans hurtle through the MiB system of pneumatic tubes.
The Archanans fly through the tubes, relaxed and happy, moving gracefully, like fish through water...
Kay is in perfect controlled tube position -- everything clenched, hands by his sides, looking like he's in an "air luge"...
Jay is SCREAMING and ricocheting off the sides of the tube like a pinball...
They shoot SOUTH, passing landmarks of the Eastern seaboard...
Intercut with Jay's face -- blown back like Right Stuff astronauts in a G-Force simulator.
Jay FLAILS towards the Archanans, grabs onto the Lama's robe:
JAY (yelling over the wind
I have to know -- can I really prevent Kay's murder?
LAMA Yes.
JAY Oh.
JAY Okay, then.
JAY Thanks, good to hear.
LAMA But where there was death, there will be death.
JAY What does that mean?
JAY The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current.
JAY Jay gets CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube.
Sugar cane workers pick crops next to a GIANT IRRIGATION
They look up as SCREAMS DOPPLER THROUGH THE PIPE -- what the hell was that?
We follow the SCREAM...
Jay CONTINUES TO SCREAM --
TUBE P.A. (V.0.) All passengers, prepare to de-tube.
JAY De-tube?
TUBE P.A. (V.0.) Please make sure all helmet and crash suit straps are securely fastened.
TUBE P.A. (V.0.) On Jay -- no helmet, no crash suit.
JAY Helmet?
JAY No one said anything about
Jay, Kay and the Archanans are launched from the tube like human cannonballs...
The Archanans land gracefully, floating down air currents like kung fu masters...
Kay hits with both feet and rolls...
Jay face plants into the water.
Jay looks up -- FIVE MANATEES STARE HIM DOWN.
The ALPHA MANATEE emits along, lowing manatee song which RESOLVES INTO
Sorry, I have something in my throat.
They went that way...
JAY Thanks.
JAY Surrounded by thick brush, trees.
JAY Jay staggers out of the water, looking beat to hell.
JAY (CONT'D) Kay?
JAY (CONT'D) Archanans?
JAY (CONT'D) Everyone OK?
Reveal -- Everyone else looks clean and pressed.
Jay looks around -- nothing but brush and swamp.
JAY (CONT'D) Listen, your, uh...
JAY (CONT'D) Arachaness...ness?
JAY (CONT'D) I don't think this here is the way back to your planet.
JAY (CONT'D) The Archanans smile and WALK OFF...
JAY (CONT'D) Jay and Kay follow --
JAY (CONT'D) Hey wait -- we can't help you get home, if you don't tell us how...
JAY (CONT'D) He trails off as they EMERGE FROM THE BRUSH And stop dead...
JAY (CONT'D) Whoa.
JAY (CONT'D) So that's how you're getting home.
JAY (CONT'D) Reveal -- A GLORIOUS SHOT OF THE APOLLO ROCKET And they head towards destiny...
Jay and Kay take in the MASSIVE SCENE...
The huge crowd, the security, the press.
HISTORY IN THE
T-Minus 30 minutes.
JAY Okay.
JAY So we've got...
JAY 30 minutes to get past security.
JAY Get into Mission Control.
JAY Reprogram the flight path, pull the Astronauts off the launch and get them in that rocket.
KAY Well, then.
KAY Better get started.
JAY Weird.
JAY I feel like I've been here.
Okay, I've got a plan to get through security.
We just need to be invisible.
Hurtling down the highway on his superfast bike, kicking up a
He gets STUCK BEHIND AN 18-WHEELER.
Yaz REVS -- and SPEEDS
Down the CAUSEWAY -- the rocket in the distance...
EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE Heavily guarded by AIR FORCE SECURITY -- people with a lot of guns and very little sense of humor.
EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE And up steps Jay, leading Kay and the Archanans.
JAY 'Scuse me...
JAY I need to get inside...
JAY I've got the big man's Cadillac...
JAY all washed and ready to- Before the words are out of Jay's mouth, he's down on the ground with a submachine gun stuck in his neck.
GUARD Move and it's the last thing you do!
GUARD The security is on Kay and the Archanans, forcing them down.
GUARD Kay gives Jay a look --
KAY Good work.
KAY It's like we're not even here.
Sir, this is unit 3 bravo -- we have an attempted perimeter breach into mission control subhallway Charlie.
One caucasian, one negroid, four...
other.
Yes, sir.
We'll hold them here, sir.
JAY You've got it wrong, let me explain-
GUARD Shut up!
GUARD Anything you have to say, you can say to my superior officer!
GUARD And boy does he hate your kind...
GUARD A click...
GUARD click...
GUARD click...
GUARD Someone is approaching.
GUARD Someone who walks like they mean business.
GUARD (CONT'D) Lt.
GUARD (CONT'D) Colonel!
GUARD (CONT'D) Here are the intruders, sir!
GUARD (CONT'D) Jay cranes to see the Colonel -- he's African American.
GUARD (CONT'D) Jay grins, relieved --
JAY Finally, someone I can talk to-- But the Colonel is on him before you can blink, an equal-
opportunity hardass to the extreme:
COLONEL The only thing we're gonna talk about is what specific breed of dumbass you have to be to try to penetrate my launch site!
COLONEL He begins patting Jay down.
COLONEL Eyes widen --
COLONEL Weapon!
COLONEL You are going away for a long time...
COLONEL Get them into holding.
COLONEL We'll interrogate them after the launch.
A beat...
and Jay goes for it:
JAY Sir, before you do that --- my name is Agent Jay.
JAY I appreciate your position, but I'm from a top-secret government agency in charge of protecting the world from the scum of the universe and right now, on
behalf of the people of Earth, I.: need to commandeer your rocket so
--can board it.
Can we count on your help?
The Colonel stares at him for a beat..
COLONEL So you want us to stop the most massive endeavor in American history, an event being watched by the entire world, the moment that will be the culmination of a challenge put to us by President John F. Kennedy himself...
COLONEL so a bunch of Hare Krishnas can take a joy ride?
JAY Would it help if I told you I'm from the future?
COLONEL Get them out of here!
COLONEL He motions to the other MPs, who move to roust the group...
COLONEL But the Lama takes the Colonel by the arm--
COLONEL (CONT'D) Hey!
COLONEL (CONT'D) --and PULLS HIM INTO HIS AURA.
COLONEL (CONT'D) On THE COLONEL'S face...
COLONEL (CONT'D) He sees something POWERFUL The Lama releases him...
COLONEL (CONT'D) The officer is stunned for a moment.
COLONEL (CONT'D) Blinks back into focus and turns to the other guards --
COLONEL (CONT'D) You men are no longer needed here.
COLONEL (CONT'D) Report to delta gate.
GUARD Sir?
COLONEL Go!
GUARD Yes, sir...
The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans:
COLONEL The rest of you, come with me.
COLONEL The Colonel heads into the building.
COLONEL They follow.
JAY Things change when you can see the future, right?
COLONEL They sure do.
COLONEL This is definitely about some next-level shit.
The PA crackles:
P.A. (V.0.) T-minus seven minutes to launch...
Mission control is an underground hub with hallway "spokes".
Jay, Kay and the Archanans follow the Colonel down the hallway towards the main Mission Control center.
A hive of activity leading up to the launch..
Miles and miles of white guys in buzzcuts and shortsleeve button-down shirts.
Thick glasses, slide rules, pocket protectors -- a sea of IBM men.
Everyone smoking, RUSHING AROUND, LAST-MINUTE CHAOS...
Hunkered over computer monitors...
reel-to-reel data tapes spinning.
Less computing power than an iPhone, but we put a man on the moon.
P.A. (V.0.) T-minus six minutes...
JAY Attention, everyone!
JAY We've got a change in plans!
JAY Everyone's consumed with the launch and wearing headsets -- they ignore him -- he keeps trying --
JAY (CONT'D) Hey!
JAY (CONT'D) Attention over here!
JAY (CONT'D) I need to talk to the man who can re- program this rocket!
JAY (CONT'D) Still nothing --
JAY (CONT'D) Can anyone hear me?
JAY (CONT'D) Hey!
JAY (CONT'D) You in the glasses!
25 people in identical giant black plastic glasses turn.
COLONEL Agent Jay!
COLONEL Over here!
COLONEL They see the Colonel with an Engineer at a workstation.
COLONEL (CONT'D) This is your man.
COLONEL (CONT'D) The guys approach the Engineer --
ENGINEER You see this card?
ENGINEER The rocket's flight path is all on cards just like this one.
ENGINEER Right here -- He indicates a long metal rack, like a mail-sorting machine, that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a processor.
ENGINEER An Archanan approaches and BLOWS ON THE CARDS -- it hits the cards like a mini-whirlwind.
ENGINEER The cards spiral everywhere like bats pouring out of a cave -- chads fly off -- they're magically re-programmed!
ENGINEER And fly back into the rack.
The engineers are STUNNED.
And then PANIC:
ENGINEER (CONT'D) The trajectory has been altered!
A BIG LOW-TECH GRAPHIC APPEARS on the BIG LOW-RES MONITOR:
ENGINEER (CONT'D) Abort launch!
ENGINEER (CONT'D) Abort launch!
JAY Slow down there!
JAY Everyone be cool!
ENGINEER Coolness is an inappropriate response!
ENGINEER The Engineer flips the SAFETY off a red button marked "ABORT"
ENGINEER (CONT'D) Aborting in 5...
JAY No!
JAY Stop!
JAY Do not abort!
The Engineer raises his ABORTING HAND -- About to slam it down in the button!
This might help.
Kay reaches into his jacket, takes out WHAT APPEARS TO BE A
JAY What's that?
JAY You been holding out on me?
KAY Little something I've been working on.
KAY Glasses if you've got 'em.
KAY Jay and Kay put on their glasses...
2. Jay and Kay in sunglasses -- for a moment, it's the iconic look of the posters...
JAY Ha ha, just like old times...
KAY Oh, and you might want to get under a desk.
JAY Get under a--?
ENGINEER One!
ENGINEER The engineers hand comes down...
ENGINEER but before he can hit the
Kay hits the trigger -- But instead of a FLASH -- A MILLION PELLETS EXPLODE OUT OF THE NEURALIZER -- bouncing everywhere, knocking out the engineers.
The pellets KEEP WHIZZING EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING: Jay and Kay have to talk over the sounds of people getting KO'd.
JAY What the hell was that??
KAY It's a high-velocity non-lethal pellet-gun.
KAY The boys in the lab call it the "hiv-nol-pog."
JAY Catchy.
JAY The Archanans deftly step out of the way -- or the pellets swerve around them.
JAY EX RUNS IN, flanked by security and/or MiB agents.
EX It's Kay!
EX There he is!
EX Take him down!
EX Shoot him if you have to!
EX EX catches a PELLET TO THE GROIN, crumples.
EX The pellets settle...
EX quiet...
P.A. (V.0.) T-minus...
P.A. (V.0.) Five minutes.
P.A. (V.0.) The engineers start COMING TO, dazed, wondering WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED -- Kay and Jay give them a "neuralizer" cover
What the hell is wrong with you people?
Raquel Welch comes by for a personal tour of Mission Control and you faint like a bunch of schoolgirls!
KAY What a waste.
ENGINEER Raquel Welch was here?
JAY Five minutes to get to the rocket.
JAY And keep your eyes open for Yaz.
JAY They head out.
With only a few minutes to go, service trucks CLEAR THE TARMAC -- dozens of fuel trucks, etc., Driving to get a safe distance away from the blast.
The all SWERVE OUT OF THE WAY As one car cuts through them GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, parting the waters -- it's a military jeep -- THE COLONEL at the wheel, Jay, Kay and the rest, barely hanging on.
The apollo astronauts ride across the tarmac towards the rocket.
The only car.
Looking up at that rocket.
On NEIL ARMSTRONG, practicing:
That's one little step that I did, one big step for the rest of you...
Wait, that's not it.
Did that sound weird to you guys?
The driver SLAMS ON THE BRAKES
BUZZ ALDRIN What in Sam Hill is going on?
BUZZ ALDRIN Reveal the Jeep, pulled in front of the Astronauts, cutting them off.
KAY No disrespect meant, [major].
KAY I'm a big fan.
JAY But we've got some bigger fish to fry.
JAY Hand over the flight suits.
JAY They start pulling the astronauts off the truck.
JAY The astronauts protest.
JAY (CONT'D) Let's go, people.
JAY (CONT'D) Why don't you take one giant leap out of there.
They look at Jay and Kay...
at the Colonel...
COLONEL That's right, gentlemen.
COLONEL You need to listen to them.
COLONEL We're going to protocol twelve.
COLONEL The astronauts acquiesce.
BUZZ ALDRIN I didn't want to get in that death trap anyways.
NEIL ARMSTRONG I'm still getting my parade, right?
EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE The same guards who stopped Jay and Kay are back on duty.
EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE They hear something -- they draw weapons -- And it's Yaz.
EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE Still looking like evil incarnate.
EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE The guards take in this unholy picture...
YAZ I want in.
YAZ The guards look at each other --
GUARD Should we radio the Colonel?
GUARD (CONT'D) You wanna get yelled at again?
GUARD (CONT'D) They wave him by.
GUARD (CONT'D) Go ahead.
Kay loads the Archanans into the capsule., Technicians in clean suits assist.
Jay works like a secret service agent -- scanning for all possible threats.
Jay checks his stop watch -- Four minutes to go...
Kay works'with the Archanans--
JAY We good yet, Kay?
JAY I don't like being out here in the open -- too many ways for Yaz to get to you...
KAY I'm almost there.
KAY Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch.
KAY (CONT'D) Hey, tech guys -- get back here and help me with the door.
TECH It's called-a hatch.
KAY Whatever, just get over here.
JAY Oh, come on -- what's going on?
KAY This door is complicated.
JAY Oh, for...
KAY What?
KAY It's an Apollo rocket, not a Plymouth Valiant, OK?
KAY It's complicated.
KAY Jay goes over to help Kay with the door.
KAY They both fuss and fight over the door.
JAY Lift it.
JAY You have to lift it.
KAY No, I am lifting it.
KAY You have to hold the lever.
JAY No, if I hold the lever, the rubber thingie won't...
JAY go in the thing where the thingie goes...
JAY Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass.
KAY Jay...
KAY Why do you think a highly trained NASA technician would leave the back of his suit unzipped?
KAY They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the Chinese restaurant...
JAY Because it's about to go down.
JAY They turn around, draw weapons on the tech -- it's YAZ!
Welcome to the good stuff From here, we launch into a GIANT SET PIECE that will take us up and around the Apollo Rocket...
As Jay and Kay battle Yaz and Devil Girl in a super-high- stakes confrontation to protect the Archanans...
We will pay off that YAZ ISAVIRUS, bentonDESTROYINGTHE EARTH to avenge the deaths ofhis brothers --smallpoxand bubonic plague.
The launch clock ticks down -- the action moves around pipes breathing fire, the gigantic scaffolding, liquid oxygen spewing from the rocket...
All on top of a rocket taller than a 30-story skyscraper.
With T-minus 25 seconds to go, Jay and Kay corner Yaz against the lunar capsule.
Yaz laughs at Jay and Kay.
YAZ You can't stop me!
YAZ Nothing on Earth can stop me!
JAY Nothing now.
JAY Yaz raises an eyebrow...
Jay draws his NOISY CRICKET -- the gun he brought from the future.
KAY What's that?
JAY Little something I brought with me.
JAY Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS -- As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5...
JAY 4...
YAZ Try it!
YAZ You wouldn't dare!
YAZ One false shot and you'll rip space and time!
JAY That's a chance I'll have to take.
JAY Jay BLASTS YAZ Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE...
JAY The hatch SLAMS him in!
JAY Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF--
KAY Uh oh -- But the Archanans surround them with their aura -- where the flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them...
KAY And then it's over...
As they watch the rocket carry Yaz off...
JAY We did it, partner.
JAY I hope you remember this when you recruit me -- you won't give me such a hard time.
KAY You know I will.
JAY Yeah.
KAY I guess we'll have to build a prison on the moon or something.
KAY Jay realizes -- grabs Kay --
JAY Do a better job this time, OK?
JAY That needs to be one hell of a prison.
JAY You don't want that guy coming back, or I'm coming back.
JAY Look, once was enough, OK?
JAY Jay turns to The Colonel --
JAY (CONT'D) Thank you for your help, sir.
JAY (CONT'D) Hope we don't get you fired.
COLONEL Not too worried about that.
JAY Can I ask you -- what did the Lama show you in there that made you help us?
JAY Was it the Earth being destroyed?
COLONEL No -- it was my son.
COLONEL All grown up.
COLONEL As a matter of fact, I'm late to see him -- I promised I'd watch the launch with him.
JAY Oh.
JAY Thanks.
JAY He's a lucky kid.
COLONEL I'm a lucky dad.
COLONEL Take care.
COLONEL Jay offers him a handshake.
COLONEL The officer takes it -- and pulls Jay into a hug.
JAY Okay...
JAY The Colonel leaves.
JAY Jay and Kay congratulate each other, smile over a job well done...
JAY But then they see the Archanans...
JAY And realize...
KAY We're sorry we didn't get you home, guys.
KAY It was the only way to get rid of Yaz.
JAY But we'll make sure you're safe here.
JAY And the next rocket out...
LAMA All is well.
LAMA You have done well.
JAY No we didn't.
JAY You wanted to go home...
LAMA There is what we desire and what must be...
LAMA And now our gift to you...
JAY Gift?
JAY But we didn't get you home.
ARCHANANS There is the action and there is the intention.
ARCHANANS It is the intention we reward.
LAMA You did the right thing.
LAMA And if humans are capable of such sacrifice, such friendship...
LAMA perhaps we ARE already home.
JAY So then what's the gift?
LAMA You already have it.
LAMA Jay looks at pong.
JAY This?
JAY Pong?
LAMA Yes.
LAMA PONG.
LAMA The Pan-Galactic Ordnance Negation Grid.
LAMA Agent Kay will use this technology...
JAY To make the missile defense system.
JAY You use this to save the world.
ARCHANANS Yes.
ARCHANANS Don't drop it.
ARCHANANS They take the PONG and drape it around Kay's neck The Archanans leave, chanting...
Bip...
Bip...
Bip...
And it's just Jay and Kay.
Jay looks at Kay wearing the PONG...
just like in the case file picture...
JAY Hey.
JAY My watch stopped.
JAY We see -- a minute to go.
JAY Jay looks at the watch.
JAY Something about it bothers him...
KAY C'mon.
KAY Let's go watch that bastard leave the atmosphere.
JAY Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a second.
Jay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the scaffolding.
JAY So you guys understand all this time stuff, right?
JAY So is everything going to be okay now?
JAY I mean, if I saved everything, and Yaz is really gone, why am I even here?
JAY Shouldn't I not have come in the first place?
JAY And why do I still have time left on my watch?
The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of underground hallways.
Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking...
,He sees a WALL CLOCK -- 3:59.
JAY 3:59.
JAY But Kay didn't get killed until...
JAY And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --
JAY (CONT'D) He didn't come yet!
JAY (CONT'D) Kay, he didn't come yet!!!
JAY (CONT'D) Jay races to find Kay.
Unaware that his appointment with death is near...
Racing down a hallway...
hunting Kay...
WITH JAY Running...
WITH JAY running...
WITH JAY searching...
WITH JAY where is Kay?
All converging on destiny...
WITH JAY Running...
WITH JAY more frantic now...
WITH JAY And then he sees him!
WITH JAY Kay -- at the end of the hallway!.
WITH JAY Backlit by the door to the outside...
JAY Kay!
JAY And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there!
JAY Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot!
JAY Yaz pulls his guns...
Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to know HE'S ABOUT TO DIE!
Yaz FIRES!!
But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead!
He catches the bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes.
And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ AND KILL HIM, blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch.
They look at each other -- it's over.
KAY See?
KAY I knew you had my back.
KAY Jay hears footsteps.
KAY Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL
As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller, shrinking to KID SIZE.
It's a boy.
Dad?
What's going on?
The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG
JAY Where there is death, there will always be death.
JAY He saved your life.
JAY He swapped his for yours.
JAY He saved the world.
JAY Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --
KAY I'll take it from here.
KAY Kay steps away...
KAY but turns back.
KAY In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses Kay a modern Neuralizer.
JAY Leave me some memories this time,
KAY Sure, partner.
KAY I'll see you around.
JAY Yes you will.
JAY Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand.
Jay watches them from a distance: Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body was -- hands it to the son.
KAY Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to have this.
KAY Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain.
KAY Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and worn.
Where is he?
KAY Your daddy had to go -- he's part of the space program, now.
KAY He's okay, he just had to take a trip up to the stars, but you'll be just fine.
KAY I'll keep an eye on you...
KAY They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo launch...
KAY Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE...
And it resolves into...
Jay comes to in the Apple Store, looks to the sky and
JAY Noo!!!!
JAY And then...
JAY A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and
EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING Jay is walking on air -- thrilled to see the deadpan security guard.
JAY It's good to see you, man.
JAY He gives him a hug-- gets a "what the hell?" face.
Jay is thrilled to be back -- hugging everyone he can.
No one else knows what he's talking about -- from their POV he never left...
It all seems the same except for quick shots of Ex the bitter janitor, aged Devil Girl pushing the coffee cart...
Jay bounces through the MiB HQ -- it's just a regular day to everyone else, but it's HOME SWEET HOME to Jay.
He even gives the worm guys a big, gushy hug.
A crowd of people gathers around Kay, congratulating him on winning the Bowling trophy...
AGAIN.
Kay looks up -- SMILES BIG when he sees Jay.
KAY Alright, everyone, give me and my partner here a minute.
KAY They leave the guys alone.
KAY A beat -- and Jay just wraps him in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.
JAY It's good to see you, man.
JAY So good.
JAY I just...
JAY do you remember...
JAY I mean, do you know what I've been through?
JAY Kay just stares at him.
KAY You mean, do I remember that you travelled back in time to save my life and the world?
KAY Not bad, slick.
KAY Not bad.
JAY No problem.
JAY You'd do the same for me.
JAY I just have one question...
JAY (CONT'D) When you disappeared...
JAY (CONT'D) Why didn't I forget you when everyone else did?
KAY Well, I don't know exactly.
KAY Because I was dead.
KAY But in a quantum reality, objects can exist in contradictory states...
KAY So multiple timelines with varying probabilities can exist, and the one you're closest to
JAY Oh, you're talking about our closeness...
JAY you're talking about our love...
JAY Across timelines!
JAY You're saying our love will go on!
JAY Kay swats him away -- but the love couldn't be more clear.
JAY Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain.
JAY Takes it out.
JAY (CONT'D) He was a good man.
KAY Yes he was.
JAY I'm glad I know that.
KAY So you travelled back in time, huh?
JAY Yep.
KAY Wow.
KAY And you didn't change anything?
JAY No.
KAY You're sure?
KAY Because the littlest thing can have huge repercussions.
JAY I was very careful.
KAY Good man, good man.
KAY Well, let's get you a uniform.
JAY Excuse me?
JAY We PULL BACK -- Revealing PRESENT DAY MIB IN ALL ITS KICKASS GRANDEUR.
JAY Eternally vigilant in the struggle to protect the Earth and all its inhabitants...
JAY And every one of those agents wearing BLUE SUITS WITH SHORTS.
JAY (CONT'D) Even I can't make that look good.
