PAT What, are you kidding me?
PAT Sundays?
PAT I love Sundays.
PAT I live for Sundays.
PAT The whole family's together.
PAT Mom makes braciole.
PAT Dad puts the jersey on.
PAT We're all watching the game.
PAT Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes, I was negative.
PAT SOLATANO stands in the middle of his room, his back to camera.
PAT (CONT'D) You didn't even know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did.
PAT (CONT'D) I just didn't appreciate it, or you, before."
There is a knock at the door.
MALE ORDERLY Come on.
MALE ORDERLY Time to go.
PAT I lost all that.
PAT I blew it.
PAT But you also blew it.
PAT We can get it back.
PAT We're gonna get it back.
PAT It's all gonna be better now.
PAT I'm better now and I hope you are, too.
PAT And I'm
Another knock at the door.
Pat ignores it.
PAT (CONT'D) Hey, I'll be there in a minute, okay?
MALE ORDERLY Doctor's waiting.
MALE ORDERLY Let's go.
PAT I'll be there in a minute.
Pat returns to his speech.
PAT (CONT'D) That's true love.
See glimpses of Pat's room: mayonnaise jar filled with water, black trash bag strewn on the bed, handwritten sign taped to Pat's wall, "EXCELSIOR".
DRINKS WATER, OPENS MOUTH WIDE AND STICKS HIS TONGUE OUT to show he swallowed.
DANNY Yeah, that's when I had long hair.
DANNY People say I talk about my hair too much.
DANNY (CONT'D) And it was just the way I wanted it, but he cut it back too far.
DANNY (CONT'D) He cut this side back too far trying to even it up.
DANNY (CONT'D) I didn't tell him to do that.
DANNY (CONT'D) I said, "Just cut it the way you cut it...."
PAT Once you get in the right frame of mind, I think anything's possible.
PAT I think we get, we so often get caught in this state of negativity and it's a, it's a poison like nothing else.
PAT works out: drinks water from his plastic mayo jar, does squats, sit ups, push ups --
Pat looks at the foot -- then looks up -- HIS MOTHER, DOLORES SOLATANO, dressed in a dress.
TIMBERS ...technically, you can take him out against our recommendation, but you assume a lot of liability in the eyes of the court.
TIMBERS And he's just getting used to the routine here.
DOLORES I don't want him to get used to the routine here.
DOLORES Eight months is already long enough.
PAT Hey, Mom.
PAT Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly?
DOLORES What?
DOLORES I don't understand.
PAT Mom, no, it'll be fine.
PAT It'll be fine.
DANNY I guess everybody's leaving today!
DANNY Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally meet you.
DANNY Pat told me all about you, how God made you rich in character, and you're the mighty oak that holds the household together, and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day when the Birds play.
PAT Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol.
DANNY Bad combination.
PAT Yeah.
PAT On top of an anxiety disorder.
DANNY That was when I was an X-ray technician with my ADD and my anxiety.
DANNY I had a lot of access to medication and I took advantage of it.
DANNY That's when my hair was long, too.
DANNY But my hair only grew when I was older.
DANNY When I was younger, my hair didn't grow because my brother...
DANNY Remember I told you about my brother, he had a Jheri curl, and I couldn't get a Jheri curl because my hair didn't grow long enough.
DANNY I was so jealous of my brother...
PAT He's obsessed with his hair.
DOLORES Hello?
PAT It looks great now.
DANNY You like it?
PAT It's good now.
DOLORES Yes, it is.
DANNY Wait, you're going the wrong way!
DOLORES What?
DOLORES Are you sure about that?
DOLORES I'll bring him back right away.
DOLORES (CONT'D) You lied to me, Pat.
DOLORES (CONT'D) Danny's not allowed to leave.
PAT All right, Mom, just hold on a sec.
PAT Let's just talk about this.
PAT Mom, just listen--
DOLORES Don't tou-...
DOLORES ...-ch the steering...
...wheel!
DOLORES Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.
PAT I'm sorry, Mom.
PAT You okay?
DOLORES I am out on a limb for you with the courts right now.
DANNY It's my fault.
DANNY Pat didn't know.
DANNY Pat didn't know.
DANNY He's my friend, so he was rootin' for me.
DANNY (CONT'D) I'm havin' a disagreement with the hospital, but we're working it out.
DANNY (CONT'D) Take me back to the hospital, but take Pat home, he's fine.
DANNY (CONT'D) Trust me.
DANNY (CONT'D) You'll see, he's fine.
DANNY (CONT'D) It's my fault.
PAT Mom, can we stop at the library?
PAT I wanna read Nikki's entire English high school syllabus.
PAT (CONT'D) Mom, it's a good thing.
PAT (CONT'D) I'm remaking myself.
RANDY (O.S. PRELAP) DeSean Jackson.
RANDY (O.S. PRELAP) What happened to DeSean Jackson?
RANDY Come on, tell me that one.
PAT SR. It's insanity.
PAT SR. He spikes the ball at the one yard line.
PAT SR. The one- fucking-yard line.
PAT SR. I mean, get into the end zone, dummy.
PAT SR. I mean, he celebrates before he's even in!
RANDY You know something?
RANDY It's nothing new.
RANDY Your team does that all the time.
RANDY They get close...
RANDY (CONT'D) ...and then they blow it.
RANDY (CONT'D) They got an inferiority complex.
PAT SR. Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
PAT SR. What makes the Cowboys America's Team?
RANDY Because we are, we're America's Team.
PAT SR. You should be ashamed of yourself.
PAT SR. We're in Philadelphia, what's the matter with you?
PAT SR. You're a fucking traitor.
RANDY What's more American than a cowboy?
PAT SR. You know what's more American?
RANDY What?
PAT SR. Benjamin Franklin, that's what's more American.
RANDY Benjamin Franklin?
PAT SR. Benjamin Franklin.
PAT SR. The founder of our country, here in Philadelphia.
RANDY You mean the guy with the...
RANDY ...little glasses and the long scraggly hair?
PAT SR. What about the lightning with the kite?
PAT SR. He stood in the storm with a kite.
RANDY If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill, nobody...
RANDY (CONT'D) ...would even know who he is.
PAT SR. What are you doing?
PAT SR. No, no, no, no.
PAT SR. Don't touch them, don't touch them.
RANDY I didn't even touch `em.
RANDY Why are you--, don't blame me.
PAT SR. Who did this?
PAT SR. Who took, who took, who took the...
PAT SR. -the remotes like this?
PAT SR. Did you do this, Randy?
RANDY No, I don't touch them.
RANDY As a matter of fact, I don't know why you need so many.
RANDY Hey, there she is!
RANDY Look how beautiful!
PAT SR. What?!
PAT SR. What's this?!
RANDY Hey.
PAT SR. Everything good?
PAT Mm-hmm.
PAT SR. Ahh.
(CONT'D) Where is it?
PAT It's right here.
PAT SR. You got it.
PAT SR. Ahh, well, we got that.
PAT SR. We don't want them to steal that.
PAT You still got yours?
PAT SR. Yeah, I got mine.
(CONT'D) So what, you don't talk to me?
(CONT'D) You didn't tell me you took him out.
DOLORES Well, he's ready.
DOLORES Look at him.
PAT You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up?
DOLORES Don't worry about that.
PAT SR. I wanna make sure when you come out that you're okay, and she didn't say anything.
PAT SR. (to Dolores) You didn't tell me?
DOLORES The court said yes.
DOLORES Don't worry.
PAT SR. Yeah, but what did the doctor say?
PAT SR. Because the, the court listens to the doctor.
PAT Yeah, and the court said--
PAT SR. The court listens to the doctor,
PAT Dad, relax.
PAT The court said it's fine, okay?
PAT Let it go.
DOLORES Don't worry.
PAT Dad, I'm in there because of the court.
PAT That's the agreement that we made months ago.
PAT It was a plea bargain with the courts.
PAT The lawyer, he instructed me, he said that what we should plead that, and then I would serve eight months and then I'd get out.
PAT SR. Yeah, no, I just--
DOLORES It's all under control.
PAT SR. Well...okay, okay.
PAT SR. Congratulations.
PAT Thank you.
PAT So what are you doing with yourself?
PAT SR. You know, I'm gonna start a restaurant.
(CONT'D) It's gonna be a cheesesteak place.
PAT How you gonna pay for it?
PAT SR. I'm gonna pay for it, don't worry about it.
From your bookmaking?
Who told you that?
Mom told me.
Outside.
I did not.
No, I didn't.
You just told me outside, Mom, what are you talking about?
Five minutes ago, we were walking up the stairs, you said, "Don't say anything, but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking."
Why, Dolores?
Why did you say that to him?
He has the wrong idea.
Everything's fine, Patrick.
I'm more concerned about you than anything else.
Good, Dad.
Good.
Okay, the question, the big question, is what are you gonna do with yourself?
What am I gonna do?
I'm getting in shape, I'm getting trim, I'm getting really fit for Nikki.
I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching syllabus and get my old job back.
Nikki sold the house.
She left.
Didn't your mother tell you that?
Let me tell you something.
You don't know anything about my marriage, okay, Dad?
All right?
Our marriage...we're very, very much in love, okay?
Just like you two.
Listen, Patrick, she's gone.
She's not around anymore.
Nikki left.
PAT What are you doing, Dad?
PAT You know what?
PAT Excelsior.
PAT Excelsior.
PAT SR. What does that mean?
PAT It means you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take all this negativity and use it as fuel and I'm gonna find a silver lining, that's what I'm gonna do.
PAT And that's no bullshit.
PAT That's no bullshit.
PAT That takes work and that's the truth.
PAT What the fuck?!
PAT Stupid fucking book!
PAT I just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids.
PAT I mean the whole time -- let me just break it down for you -- the whole time you're rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley...
DOLORES It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat.
PAT ...and he does.
PAT He does.
PAT He survives the war, after getting blown up he survives it, and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine.
PAT But now Catherine's pregnant.
PAT Isn't that wonderful?
PAT She's pregnant.
PAT And they escape up into the mountains and they're gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance -- they both like to dance with each other, there's scenes of them dancing, which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy.
PAT You think he ends it there?
PAT No!
PAT He writes another ending.
PAT She dies, Dad!
PAT I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys.
PAT It's fucking hard enough as it is.
PAT Can't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive?
PAT Let's have a good ending to the story?"
DOLORES Pat, you owe us an apology.
PAT Mom, for what, I can't apologize.
PAT I'm not gonna apologize for this.
PAT You know what I will do?
PAT I will apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here.
PAT SR. Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologize to us, too.
PAT SR. Why didn't you run with me?
PAT I was reading.
PAT SR. Please.
PAT SR. Do us a favor, don't read for a while.
PAT SR. (CONT'D) What are you wearing a garbage bag for?
PAT I'm gonna go run now.
PAT SR. Wait, wait, wait.
PAT SR. You have to fix this window.
PAT I'll fix it when I get back.
PAT SR. Fix it now.
DOLORES Get in the car, Pat.
DOLORES You have to go to therapy.
PAT I don't wanna go to therapy.
DOLORES You have to go.
DOLORES It's part of the deal.
DOLORES You can't live with us and not go.
PAT Is that song really playing?
RECEPTIONIST We have music sometimes.
PAT That song is killing me.
PAT Could you please turn it off?
RECEPTIONIST I can't.
PAT What do you mean, you can't?
RECEPTIONIST I don't have the controls.
RECEPTIONIST I'm sorry, I--
PAT Did Doctor Timbers put you up to this?
PAT Is there a speaker here?
PAT (CONT'D) Is, is the speaker here?
PAT (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
PAT (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
PAT (CONT'D) Okay...I'm sorry.
PAT (CONT'D) I'll fix all this, okay?
PAT That was a messed up thing you did, Doctor Patel.
PAT That's a messed up thing.
PAT I'm sorry, but that's....
DR. PATEL You can call me Cliff, please.
PAT Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way you're supposed to meet people, okay?
PAT Why don't you write that down in your, I don't know, your little book you write stuff down in.
DR. PATEL I'm sorry about that song.
DR. PATEL I just wanted to see if it was still a trigger for you.
PAT Bravo.
PAT It's a trigger.
PAT I'm not gonna take any meds, I should just tell you that right now.
DR. PATEL You have to take medicine.
PAT No, I'm not gonna take any medicine.
PAT It makes me foggy--
DR. PATEL No, you will have to take medication.
PAT I don't want any meds, Doctor.
PAT Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay?
PAT My father is the explosion guy.
PAT I'm not that guy.
PAT He got kicked out of that stadium he beat up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list.
PAT I had one incident.
DR. PATEL One incident can change a lifetime.
PAT But I'm ready.
PAT I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street.
PAT She just needs to take responsibility for hers.
DR. PATEL What's hers?
PAT What's hers?
PAT Are you joking?
PAT Let's go back to the incident.
PAT I come home from work after I
PAT I left work early -- which I never do, by the way, but I got in a fight with Nancy, the high school
PAT ...principal.
PAT I come home and what's playing but the song from my wedding.
PAT The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us.
PAT That's playing and I don't think anything of it.
PAT Which is odd, `cause I should have.
PAT I come home, what do I see?
PAT I walk in the door and I see underwear and pieces of clothing and a guy's pants with his belt in it, and I walk up the stairs, and all...
PAT ...ll of a sudden I see the DVD player, and on the D-...
PAT ...-VD player is the CD and it's playing our wedding song, and then I look down and I see my wife's...
PAT ...panties on the ground and then-
PAT ...I look up and I see her naked in the shower...
PAT ...and I think, "Oh, that's kinda sweet, she's in the shower.
PAT What a perfect thing.
PAT I'm gonna find her and maybe I'll go in there.
PAT We never-...
PAT ...fuck in the shower anymore.
PAT Maybe today we will."
PAT I...
PAT ...pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history...
PAT ...-teacher with tenure.
PAT And you know what he says to me?
PAT "You should probably go."
PAT That's what he says to me.
PAT So yeah, I snapped.
PAT I almost beat him to death.
PAT But now I get fucking chastised for it?
PAT I'm parallel to my father?
PAT I don't think so.
DR. PATEL All right.
DR. PATEL Can you talk about something that you did, before or after?
PAT Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which wasn't true.
PAT It was a delusion.
PAT And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm, uh...
DR. PATEL ...undiagnosed bipolar.
PAT Yeah.
PAT With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God.
PAT And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life.
PAT And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time.
DR. PATEL That had to be hard.
PAT Yeah.
PAT It's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what the hell is happening, which I do now.
PAT Sort of.
DOLORES Pat, you have to take your
PAT I can't, Mom.
PAT I can't.
DOLORES I will call them.
DOLORES They'll come for you.
PAT Why would you do that?
PAT You wouldn't do that.
PAT Why would you call them?
PAT SR. What's up?
PAT I don't, I don't feel good when I'm on them, Mom.
PAT I don't feel good.
PAT I'm so much clearer without them.
PAT Mom, they make me bloated.
PAT I don't like the way it makes me look.
DOLORES You've gotta take your medication.
PAT SR. Why don't you just take your medication?
PAT Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality.
PAT I've been workin' out, that's what I'm doin'.
PAT SR. Why is he wearing a garbage bag?
DOLORES Why are you wearing a garbage bag?
PAT To sweat.
PAT SR. Sit down.
PAT SR. We're seven minutes in, no score.
PAT SR. Come on, help turn the juju around.
PAT I don't believe in juju, Dad.
PAT SR. Come on, Mister Excelsior.
PAT SR. You wanna be positive?
PAT SR. Be positive.
PAT SR. Sit down.
PAT All right, all right.
PAT SR. Come on.
PAT For a second.
PAT I'll watch the beginning of the game.
DOLORES He says you're good...
DOLORES (CONT'D) ..luck, honey.
PAT What's that in your hand?
PAT SR. It's a...
PAT SR. see?
PAT Handkerchief?
PAT SR. Yeah.

(CONT'D) I want you to watch the game with me.
(CONT'D) I'm not superstitious.
(CONT'D) That's a small thing that I do.
(CONT'D) If I make a lot of money, what's the difference if I do this or that?
(CONT'D) It's a small thing.
(CONT'D) Sit down.
(CONT'D) Come on.
DOLORES I'm making crabby snacks and homemades.
PAT SR. You see?!
PAT SR. You see that?!
PAT SR. You're meant to be here!
(CONT'D) This is special.
(CONT'D) Everything happens for a reason.
(CONT'D) That's why you came home.
(CONT'D) Embrace it!
(CONT'D) Embrace it!
PAT I'm the reason?
PAT I don't think so.
PAT SR. Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes.
PAT SR. I got your whole sheet.
PAT SR. Yeah.
PAT SR. No, no...
PAT Mom.
PAT SR. ...I'm just confirming.
PAT SR. I'm just confirming.
PAT SR. Okay.
PAT SR. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

PAT SR. No.
RICKY It's for a school project!
PAT SR. Don't pay any attention.
PAT Who's that?
PAT That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it?
DOLORES That's him.
PAT Is he the guy who's having the problem?
PAT SR. People are stupid.
DOLORES Yeah, that's the one.
PAT SR. They, they, they, they don't know what they're saying.

RONNIE You gotta come see the baby.
RONNIE She's beautiful.
RONNIE And Veronica wants to make dinner for you.
PAT Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation.
RONNIE 'Cause you think Veronica still hates you?
PAT I know Veronica still hates me.
RONNIE That's not true.
PAT Yes, it is.
PAT Nikki always said that "Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, in her purse."
RONNIE That's not true.
VERONICA Ronnie!
VERONICA What are you doing?
RONNIE Okay, it's a little true.
RONNIE But if you think she still hates you, you're wrong because why would she tell me to invite you to dinner?
RONNIE Hmm?
VERONICA Did you invite him?
RONNIE Yes.
VERONICA Well, can he make it?
RONNIE I don't know yet!
RONNIE (to Pat) Can you make it next Sunday?
PAT Sure.
RONNIE I'll see you next Sunday.
PAT Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right?
PAT Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?
RONNIE Yeah.
VERONICA Get in here, please.
VERONICA I need you.
RONNIE Okay.
PAT SR. As soon as you left, the Redskins threw a trick play, a pitch out to Randal El.
PAT SR. Andy Reid wastes a time- out challenging it, loses the challenge, loses the game.
PAT SR. You're in this house, please show some respect for what I do.
PAT SR. And we should spend time together anyway.
PAT SR. I'm trying to keep you out of trouble, please.
PAT I have very, good news, everybody.
PAT Very good news.
PAT SR. What's that?
PAT SR. What's the good news?
PAT Things are looking up.
PAT SR. Oh, are they?
PAT You know what, I knew why they invited me over.
PAT I knew it.
PAT SR. Listen, she might be with that guy.
PAT SR. That, the....
PAT Oh, no way!
PAT SR. She--, no, she might be with him.
PAT SR. She's afraid of you.
PAT SR. She doesn't want to talk to you.
PAT No way, Dad.
PAT You mean, Doug Culpepper?
PAT SR. Put the phone down.
PAT SR. You gotta...
PAT Wait just a minute.
PAT SR. ...Put the phone down, please.
PAT What are you doing?
PAT SR. Listen--, stop.
PAT Give me the phone.
PAT Dad, this is my life.
PAT Dad.
PAT SR. Gimme the phone.
PAT SR. Gimme the phone.
DOLORES Pat!
PAT SR. You gotta understand me.
PAT SR. You wanna go back?
PAT SR. Well then, stop this!
PAT SR. Then don't fucking do this.
PAT Don't talk to me like that.
PAT SR. Well then, don't behave this way.
OFFICER KEOGH I got...a call asking to...
OFFICER KEOGH ...check on this house.
OFFICER KEOGH Pat Solatano?
PAT Yeah.
OFFICER KEOGH Yeah?
OFFICER KEOGH Missus Solatano, Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh.
OFFICER KEOGH I work this beat.
OFFICER KEOGH Look, I heard about the restraining order.
OFFICER KEOGH And I heard you went to your old house and the school.
OFFICER KEOGH It's not okay.
OFFICER KEOGH I've been assigned to your case, so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me.
OFFICER KEOGH Do yourself a favor.
OFFICER KEOGH Respect the restraining order, okay?
OFFICER KEOGH Five hundred feet.
PAT SR. You hear what he just said?
PAT SR. You have a restraining order.
PAT Yeah, Dad, I know.
PAT SR. Thank you, Officer.
OFFICER KEOGH If you need anything...my card.
PAT SR. Thank you.
PAT SR. Sorry.
PAT SR. We understand.
PAT Since when do cops have cards?
PATEL Tell me one thing.
PATEL Would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail or to the hospital?
PATEL Hmm?
PATEL So take your medication and if you do fine, we'll reduce them.
PAT Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me.
PAT And that's better than any medication.
DR. PATEL Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return.
DR. PATEL True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns.
DR. PATEL In the meantime, if you listen to that song, I don't want you to fall apart.
DR. PATEL So get a strategy, okay?
DR. PATEL You need one.
PAT Let me say something, I gotta say something.
DR. PATEL Okay.
PAT This is what I believe to be true.
PAT This is what I learned in the hospital.
PAT You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining.
DR. PATEL Work on a strategy, okay?
PAT Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night and it's like a real hoity-toity thing and his wife, Veronica's a real stickler for....
PAT I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles.
DR. PATEL Which jersey?
PAT DeSean Jackson.
DR. PATEL DeSean Jackson is the man.
PAT Well, that settles that.
RONNIE Pat!
RONNIE What are you doin'?
PAT I gotta go, man.
RONNIE Why?
PAT I can't stay, come on.
PAT I made a mistake, I shouldn't have worn this.
RONNIE Dude, you're fine.
RONNIE I like that jersey.
RONNIE I wish I was wearing that jersey.
PAT I feel like an idiot.
RONNIE Are you comfortable?
PAT Veronica's not gonna like it.
RONNIE Get over here.
PAT Plus you got a tie on.
RONNIE Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honor.
RONNIE You come however you wanna come.
PAT Really?
RONNIE Get over here.
RONNIE DeSean Jackson's in the house!
VERONICA You mean rookie of the year?
RONNIE Yeah.
VERONICA DeSean Jackson?
VERONICA DeSean Jackson?
VERONICA (noticing Pat) Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.
RONNIE Isn't it awesome?
VERONICA Not for dinner.
RONNIE Look, he got us flowers.
VERONICA Oh, that's sweet.
VERONICA (to Pat) That's sweet, Pat.
VERONICA That's lovely.
RONNIE And wine.
PAT Hey.
VERONICA Hey.
RONNIE Check this out.
RONNIE We just redid the whole thing.
PAT Wow!
Tremendous.
Tremendous.
Isn't it great?
Tremendous.
Yeah, man, I'm, I'm thinking of redoing it again.
Why?
Because.
Gotta be making a lot of paper to do that.
Yeah, we're doing all right, man.
I can't complain.
Isn't the market down, though?
It is down, but you know, she wants more, so I'm giving her more, man.
Hey, you know my dad lost his pension.
I'm sorry, man.
Yeah.
A lot of people.
My uncle, too.
Really?
Yeah, but you know what?
No disrespect, it's not personal, but this is the time to strike.
RONNIE (CONT'D) You start snapping up commercial real estate -- cheap -- flip it over, you flip it over and that's when you make the money.
RONNIE (CONT'D) But the pressure...it's like....
PAT You okay?
RONNIE I'm not okay.
RONNIE Don't tell anybody.
RONNIE Listen to me.
RONNIE I feel like I'm getting crushed and--
PAT Crushed by what?
RONNIE Everything.
RONNIE The family, the baby, the job, the fucking dicks at work, and it's like, you know, like I'm trying to do this, (Ronnie reaches for his throat, mimicking trying to breath) you know, and, and, and I'm like...suffocating.
PAT Holy shit.
RONNIE You can't be happy all the time.
PAT Who told you you can't be happy?
RONNIE It's all right.
RONNIE You just do your best, you have no choice.
PAT That's not true at all.
RONNIE You just can't.
PAT Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!
RONNIE I hope you're okay with Veronica's sister coming over.
RONNIE You okay with that?
PAT Who?
RONNIE Veronica's sister.
PAT AND RONNIE Tiffany.
PAT Tiffany and...Tommy?
RONNIE Yeah.
RONNIE Just Tiffany.
PAT What happened to Tommy?
RONNIE He died.
PAT Tommy died?
RONNIE Cops die.
PAT How'd he die?
RONNIE Please, don't bring it up.
PAT No, how did he die?
TIFFANY How did who die?
LOCK EYES IMMEDIATELY.
SHE IS TALL, STRIKING, INTENSE.
She walks to Ronnie and Pat, who is unsure how to behave.
RONNIE Hey, Tiffany!
RONNIE This is Pat.
RONNIE Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany.
PAT You look nice.
TIFFANY Thank you.
PAT I'm not flirting with you.
TIFFANY Oh, I didn't think you were.
PAT I just see that you made an effort and I'm gonna be better with my wife, I'm working on that.
PAT I wanna acknowledge her beauty.
PAT I never used to do that.
PAT I do that now.
PAT `Cause we're gonna be better than ever...Nikki.
PAT Just practicing.
PAT How'd Tommy die?
PAT (CONT'D) What about your job?
TIFFANY I just got fired, actually.
PAT Oh, really?
PAT How?
PAT (CONT'D) I mean, I'm sorry.
PAT (CONT'D) How'd that happen?
TIFFANY Does it really matter?
VERONICA Baby, how's it going?
RONNIE Great, great.
VERONICA Everyone having fun?
VERONICA We're gonna go on a tour now.
VERONICA We're gonna go on a tour now.
TIFFANY Let's go see the house.
RONNIE Come on, let's go for the tour.
VERONICA I've, I've been planning this forever.
VERONICA I love our house.
VERONICA I love our house.
VERONICA I'm really excited about it.
Tiffany looks back over her shoulder at Pat, intensely.
RONNIE Come on.
VERONICA Guess what it is.
PAT Oh, it's a television.
TIFFANY It's a computer screen.
RONNIE Nope.
VERONICA Just keep going, keep going, keep going.
PAT It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven.
TIFFANY It's a light.
TIFFANY It's a...
VERONICA Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer.
TIFFANY ...it's a drawer at a morgue where they pull out dead bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde.
VERONICA Don't think so hard, don't think so hard.
PAT Where would the dead body...where would the body go, though?
PAT `Cause the outside of the--
TIFFANY It's a joke!
VERONICA It's a...fireplace.
TIFFANY In the middle of the wall?
VERONICA We have a port in every room.
VERONICA Gimme an iPod.
VERONICA Who, who doesn't have an iPod?
PAT Well, I don't have an iPod.
PAT I don't even have a phone.
PAT They won't let me make any calls.
PAT They think I'm gonna call Nikki.
RONNIE Don't worry about it.
RONNIE Don't focus on that.
PAT I would call Nikki.
RONNIE I'm actually gonna give you one of my iPods.
RONNIE I have an old one.
VERONICA Gimme your iPod.
VERONICA (CONT'D) Give it to me.
VERONICA (CONT'D) Thank you, baby, thank you.
TIFFANY Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in, I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom.
VERONICA Look, look, look.
VERONICA (CONT'D) I can play music for the baby in any room.
PAT Can you play "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica?
RONNIE Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany.
RONNIE Ask him about any president, he knows 'em all.
PAT Here's a fun fact.
PAT You know where the term "OK" comes from?
VERONICA No.
VERONICA No, I don't.
RONNIE Where?
PAT Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York...
VERONICA Oh.
PAT ...and he was part of a club, a men's club, called Old Kinderhook.
PAT And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say, "That guy's OK."
PAT `Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.
RONNIE Really?
PAT Yeah.
PAT Pretty cool, right?
RONNIE That's interesting.
You know, Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years and she's real good at it.
She's gonna be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.
Oh, really?
My wife loves dance.
Nikki loves dance.
Why do you have to talk about me like that?
I'm just bragging about you.
Can't I brag about my little sister?
Don't talk about me in the third person.
Please, gimme a break.
I'm right here.
Just be nice.
Just be nice.
Wow, wow, wow.
Fascinating.
Sorry.
I don't wanna be mean.
I know.
I know, I know.
What meds are you on?
Me?
None.
I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify, but I don't take them anymore, no.
They make me foggy and they also make me bloated.
Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so I stopped.
PAT You ever take Klonopin?
TIFFANY Klonopin?
TIFFANY (Chuckling) Yeah.
PAT Right?
TIFFANY Jesus.
PAT It's like, "What?
PAT What day is it?" How about Trazodone?
TIFFANY Trazodone!
PAT Oh, it flattens you out.
PAT I mean, you are done.
PAT It takes the light right out of your eyes.
TIFFANY God, I bet it does.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) I'm tired.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) I wanna go.
VERONICA No.
VERONICA No, no, no, no.
VERONICA We haven't, we haven't even finished the salad yet, or the duck.
VERONICA I made the Fire and Ice cake.
TIFFANY I said I'm tired.
TIFFANY (to Pat) Are you gonna walk me home or what?
PAT You mean me?
TIFFANY Yeah, you.
TIFFANY Are you gonna walk me home?
PAT You have poor social skills.
PAT You have a problem.
TIFFANY I have a problem?
TIFFANY You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things.
TIFFANY You scare people.
PAT I tell the truth.
PAT But you're mean.
TIFFANY What?
TIFFANY I'm not telling the truth?
Veronica and Ronnie are very uncomfortable.
RONNIE Um, maybe I should drive them home separately?
VERONICA You can drive them both home.
VERONICA Now.
TIFFANY Stop talking about me in third person.
VERONICA You can take Tiffany home first.
TIFFANY You love it when I have problems.
TIFFANY You love it, Von, because then you can be the good one.
TIFFANY Just say it.
VERONICA No...
VERONICA (CONT'D) ...I don't.
VERONICA (CONT'D) I don't.
VERONICA (CONT'D) I just wanted to have a nice, I just wanted to have a nice dinner.
TIFFANY Oh, God.
VERONICA What is your problem?!
TIFFANY Nothing's my problem!
TIFFANY I'm fine.
TIFFANY I'm tired and I wanna go.
TIFFANY (to Pat) Come on, are you ready?
Pat stands.
VERONICA You really, you really wanna go right now?
TIFFANY Yes, I really wanna go!
TIFFANY It's been great.
RONNIE Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!
TIFFANY Sorry.
TIFFANY I don't wanna wake up the baby.
TIFFANY Bye.
RONNIE Sorry, man.
TIFFANY This is me.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't really remember how this works.
PAT How what works?
TIFFANY I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat.
TIFFANY You felt it, I felt it, don't lie.
TIFFANY We're not liars like they are.
TIFFANY I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us.
TIFFANY I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?
PAT How old are you?
TIFFANY Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital.
PAT Look, I had a really good time tonight and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay?
TIFFANY You're married?
TIFFANY So am I.
PAT No, that's confusing.
PAT He's dead.
PAT (CONT'D) Wait, what?
PAT (CONT'D) What's happening?
PAT (CONT'D) Oh, my God.
PAT (CONT'D) Hey.
DOLORES Are you okay?
DOLORES Ronnie called.
DOLORES Hey, is that make-up on your shirt?
PAT I don't know, Mom.
PAT SR. What happened over there?
PAT When am I gonna get a phone?
PAT SR. You'll get a phone in due time.

PAT Did you put it up here?
DOLORES What about in your father's study?
PAT SR. Don't go in my study.
PAT Dad, not now!
PAT Would you put it in here?
PAT It makes no sense for you to put it in here.
PAT SR. Patty, what are you doing?
PAT He's got all his Eagles videos and not one video of my wedding!
PAT (CONT'D) Is it here?
PAT (CONT'D) I mean....?
PAT SR. Patty!
DOLORES It's probably in the attic.
PAT SR. Are you going in my study?
PAT It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.
DOLORES Please stop yelling!

DOLORES Pat!
DOLORES Pat!
PAT I looked over there!
PAT I already looked all over there!
DOLORES Calm down, Pat.
PAT I'm not calming down!
PAT I don't give a fuck who hears, I'm not calming down!

PAT Let the whole neighborhood wake up!

DOLORES Pat!
DOLORES Stop it!
PAT ...don't care!
DOLORES Stop it!
DOLORES Stop it!
DOLORES Stop it!

DOLORES Pat!
DOLORES Stop it!
DOLORES Stop it!
DOLORES Stop it!
PAT I can't watch my wedding video, but I CAN hear the fucking song in my head, goddamn it!
He grabs his head, to stop hearing the wedding song.
PAT (CONT'D) Mom?
PAT SR. What the fuck you doing?!
PAT SR. You...
PAT Mom?
PAT SR. ...hit your mother?!
PAT No, no, no, no, no!
DOLORES Stop it!

The family stands together in silence.
TIFFANY Hey!
PAT What the hell?
TIFFANY What happened to your face?
PAT Weight lifting accident.
TIFFANY That sounds like bullshit.
TIFFANY Why'd you run by my house?
TIFFANY Did our little conversation get you upset last night?
PAT Hey, this is my route, okay?
PAT Just back off.
TIFFANY This is my neighborhood.
TIFFANY You just ran by my house.
PAT I like to run by myself, okay?
TIFFANY Me too.
PAT Hey, I like to run alone!
PAT Will you stop?
TIFFANY What?
PAT Okay?
PAT I'm running here!
TIFFANY Me too!
PAT Well then, why don't you run somewhere else?
PAT There's a fucking ton of roads to run in!
PAT What are you trying to do?
TIFFANY I like this road.
TIFFANY This is my neighborhood.
PAT Oh, come on, please!
TIFFANY Calm down, crazy.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Hey!
PAT What the fuck?!
PAT (CONT'D) I'm married!
TIFFANY So am I!
PAT What the fuck are you doing?
PAT Your husband's dead!
TIFFANY Where is your wife?
PAT You're crazy!
TIFFANY I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital in Baltimore.
PAT I'm not the big slut!
PAT (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
PAT (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
PAT (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
TIFFANY I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore.
TIFFANY There's always gonna be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other parts of myself.
TIFFANY Can you say the same about yourself, fucker?!
TIFFANY Can you forgive?
TIFFANY Are you any good at that?
PATEL You seemed to have trouble last night.
PAT Let me just set the record straight about last night.
PAT Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it.
PAT My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't.
PAT He's sixty-five years old.
PAT You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him?
PAT I mean....
DR. PATEL He was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well.
PAT Yes, last night was a mess.
PAT Okay?
PAT And I think he probably just tried to do his best.
DR. PATEL Pat, you have to have a strategy.
DR. PATEL I told you earlier.
DR. PATEL You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore.
DR. PATEL So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can.
PAT Yeah, but that's easier said than done.
DR. PATEL You have to do it.
DR. PATEL You have no choice.
DR. PATEL Excelsior.
PAT Yeah, Excelsior.
PAT Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay?
DR. PATEL No.
PAT Why?
Because you have a restraining order.
What good are you, man?
Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night?
Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?
Maybe you think that Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you?
Not bad, Doctor Jones.
But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.
Why is she a slut?
After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out."
Unquote.
And she still wears her wedding ring.
So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.
Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her.
She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same?
Can you?
PAT Is that....?
PAT You're asking me, you're really asking me that question?
DR. PATEL Yes.
PAT With all my crazy sad shit?
PAT What, are you fucking nuts?
DR. PATEL Pat, the silver lining thing is yours.
DR. PATEL I'm just giving back your words to you.
DR. PATEL This "crazy sad shit," as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books.
PAT No, not the books.
DR. PATEL You said Nikki's friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany.
DR. PATEL So if you become friends with Tiffany, Nikki will think that you're a kind, generous, large-hearted person, who helps people in need, who is basically thriving.
DR. PATEL So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.
CHILD (O.C.) Trick or treat!
TIFFANY Hey!
PAT How do you know when I run?
TIFFANY I wanted to clarify something.
TIFFANY I just want us to be friends.
TIFFANY Did you hear what I said?
TIFFANY Why are you giving me such a hard time?
PAT No, I'm not giving you a hard time.
TIFFANY I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit.
PAT You wanna have dinner at this diner?
TIFFANY Pick me up at seven thirty.
PAT Happy Halloween.
TIFFANY Hi.
IT.
WAITRESS Here you go.
TIFFANY Thank you.
PAT I'm gonna have a bowl of your Raisin Bran.
TIFFANY Tea.
WAITRESS Be right back.
PAT You look nice.
TIFFANY Thanks.
WAITRESS Raisin Bran.
WAITRESS Milk.
TIFFANY Thank you.
PAT You want to share this?
TIFFANY Why did you order Raisin Bran?
PAT Why did you order tea?
TIFFANY Because you ordered Raisin Bran.
PAT I ordered Raisin Bran because I didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date.
TIFFANY It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran.
PAT It's not a date.
PAT So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing?
TIFFANY It's good.
TIFFANY How's your restraining order?
PAT I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing," but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well.
PAT Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.
TIFFANY And the so-called incident with the weights.
PAT Yeah.
PAT That was a thing with my parents.
PAT I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well.
TIFFANY I can get a letter to Nikki.
TIFFANY I see her sometimes with my sister.
PAT It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.
I'd have to hide it from Veronica.
She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.
But you would do it?
I'd have to be careful.
I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job.
How did you lose your job?
By...having sex with everybody in the office.
Everybody?
I was very depressed after Tommy died.
It was a lot of people.
We don't have to talk about it.
Thanks.
How many were there?
Eleven.
Wow.
I know.
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.
Okay.
Can I ask you one more question?
Were there any women?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
What was that like?
Hot.
Jesus Christ.
Was it like...older women, a sexy teacher who wants to
Made me sit on her lap and do things?
Yeah.
What?
You sat on her lap?
Mm-hmm.
She told you what to do?
Mm-hmm.
Oh...my God.
Nikki hated when I talked like this.
Made me feel like such a pervert.
Maybe we should change the subject.
I don't mind it.
You don't, do you.
No.
But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me.
So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds.
PAT I get it.
PAT The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher...
TIFFANY I heard about that.
PAT ...it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy.
PAT Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.
TIFFANY Wow.
PAT Yeah.
PAT So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.
TIFFANY Yeah.
PAT So I know.
TIFFANY You do.
PAT I just gotta get a strategy, you know?
TIFFANY Me too.
PAT We'd better get back to the letter.
TIFFANY Yeah, let's get back to the letter.
PAT What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?
TIFFANY Yes.
TIFFANY Yes, that could work.
TIFFANY I love that.
PAT Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.
Can I at least finish my tea?
Wait, what?
My tea.
Can I finish it?
Wait a minute.
Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner?
Why would she do that?
Was it a test?
I kinda got that feeling, yeah.
Goddamn it.
I knew it.
It was a test.
How did I do?
I think I did pretty well.
Yeah, she said you were cool, basically.
"Basically"?
Was I some percentage not cool?
No, she said you were cool, but you know.
No, I don't know.
Sort of how you are.
It's fine, relax.
What do you mean?
How am I?
What does that mean?
Sort of like me.
"Sort of like you"?
I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.
Why?
PAT Because, it's just not right, lumping you and I together, I mean, it's just wrong.
PAT And Nikki wouldn't like that.
PAT Especially after all the shit you just told me.
TIFFANY You think that I'm crazier than you.
PAT Because, well, we're different, I
TIFFANY Oh, my God.
TIFFANY Ugh.
TIFFANY You're killing me.
TIFFANY You know what?
TIFFANY Forget I offered to help you.
TIFFANY Forget the entire fucking idea.
TIFFANY `Cause that must have been fucking crazy because I am so much crazier than you.
PAT Keep your voice down.
TIFFANY I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband!
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Forget it!
PAT Shut the fuck up.
TIFFANY Fuck you!

PAT Hey!
PAT Tiffany!
WAITRESS Slow down, Raisin Bran.
PEDESTRIANS (low and indistinct chatter - continues under following scenes and dialogue)
PAT Hey, come on.
PAT Look, I don't think you're crazy, all right?
TIFFANY Yes, you do.
PAT No, I don't.
TIFFANY You told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you?
PAT What?
PAT Hey, calm down!
PAT Hey--
TIFFANY Just leave me alone!
PAT Can I just explain myself, please?
PAT I didn't want Nikki to think that I was associated with that kind of sexual behavior because I've never done anything like that, okay?
TIFFANY You may not have experienced the shit that I did.
TIFFANY But you loved hearing about it, didn't you?
TIFFANY You are afraid to be alive, you're afraid to live.
TIFFANY You're a hypocrite.
TIFFANY You're a conformist.
TIFFANY You're a liar.
TIFFANY I opened up to you and you judged me.
TIFFANY You are an asshole.
TIFFANY You are an asshole!
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Get off of me!
TIFFANY (CONT'D) (yelling) Get off!
TIFFANY (CONT'D) You're harassing me!
PAT Hey, hey!

TIFFANY Get off!
MAN Take it easy.
MAN Dude, relax.

OFFICER KEOGH Come on.
OFFICER KEOGH What are you doing?
OFFICER KEOGH What are you doing to these kids?
OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D) Are you being a punk on Halloween with these kids?
OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D) You wanna go back to Baltimore?
OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D) Is that what you wanna do?
PAT I didn't, I didn't, I didn't--
TIFFANY WATCHES IN THE CROWD OF HALLOWEEN TEENS.
Softens.
TIFFANY It's the kids!
TIFFANY [Walks to Pat and Officer Keogh].
TIFFANY He didn't do anything, it was all the kids.
Officer Keogh turns to push the crowd back.
OFFICER KEOGH Let's go, clear out, nothing going on here.
PLAYING IN HIS HEAD.
Tormented.
TIFFANY You gonna go your whole life scared of that song?
TIFFANY It's just a song.
TIFFANY Don't make it a monster.
She leans close to Pat's downcast face.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) There's no song playing.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) There's no song.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Breathe, count backwards from ten.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) That's it.
Pat breathes, listens to her.
Calms himself.
Song stops.
Tiffany's face stays close to his.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) That's it.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) There you go.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) I'm sorry.
PAT I'm sorry.
TIFFANY I took it too far.
PAT I'm sorry.
OFFICER KEOGH Hey, is he messing with you?
TIFFANY No, no.
TIFFANY No, this was just a joke.
TIFFANY This is a joke I started.
OFFICER KEOGH There's a restraining order on this guy.
TIFFANY I know, I have a stupid sense of humor.
OFFICER KEOGH That's not a good thing to do.
TIFFANY Well, I'm fucked up.
TIFFANY What can I tell you?
TIFFANY I'm sorry.
OFFICER KEOGH You're Tommy's widow, right?
TIFFANY Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part.
OFFICER KEOGH You're a funny girl.
OFFICER KEOGH You wanna get a drink sometime?
OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D) What'd I say?
PAT She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore.
TIFFANY WALKS - upset, vulnerable.
Pat walks behind, CATCHES
PAT I'm sorry about what I said in the diner.
TIFFANY I know.
TIFFANY I know you didn't mean it.
PAT I didn't mean it at all.
TIFFANY I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time.
PAT All the time.
TIFFANY I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry.
TIFFANY WALKS THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD HER GARAGE.
Pat watches her go.
PAT Wow.
PAT I really appreciate that, Tiffany.
TIFFANY I know you do.
PAT You do?
TIFFANY Yeah, sure.
PAT I'll see you tomorrow?
PAT With the letter?
RANDY I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing.
RANDY Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of `em took it.
RANDY That's the only answer.
PAT SR. No, no, no.
(CONT'D) Dolores, somebody was in my study.
(CONT'D) Who took one of my envelopes?
(CONT'D) Somebody took an envelope.
DOLORES Maybe we should call the FBI.
PAT SR. Don't make fun.
PAT SR. This is serious.
PAT SR. What FBI?
PAT SR. Come on, let's take a look.
PAT SR. I'll show you what this is.
PAT SR. I'm gonna just explain to you something.
PAT SR. I mean, you know what I'm doing, honey.
PAT SR. This everything, like this.
PAT SR. I got this, it all corresponds.
PAT Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes.
PAT I hope that's not a
PAT SR. No, it's not okay.
PAT SR. It's not okay.
PAT SR. You gotta ask.
DOLORES "Do not go in my study or I will eat you!"
PAT SR. It's not funny, it's not funny.
PAT SR. What's everybody making a joke out of this for?
Dolores, you are so beautiful!
Stop that!
Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop!
Listen, a lot of envelopes go in and out of my office every day after games with a lot of cash in `em.
So show some respect for what I do.
Yeah, I know.
I saw two-seven-four.
I just wanted to tell you the number.
Thank you.
But the envelope was empty.
I'm sorry, you were sleeping.
I didn't want to wake you, but I needed an envelope.
You didn't want to wake me?
(to Dolores and Randy) He didn't want to wake me.
He doesn't have a problem complaining about Ernest fucking Hemingway.
He doesn't have a problem asking for his wedding
Be nice.
It's game day!
I'm makin' crabby snacks and homemades.
Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice.
Come on, she's making crabby snacks and homemades.
Come on, Dad!
What are you so up about?
He's very happy.
I'm happy.
No, you're so up, up, up, up.
Isn't that a good thing?
You're just up, up, up.
I don't know what that is.
Are you taking the proper dosage of your medication?
Am I taking the right dose?
Of course I am.
Okay.
Taking a little bit too many or something?
No, if I was taking that, I'd be on the floor, Dad.
Just stay with us.
Stay for the game.
Spend some family time.
Dad, I can't.
Look, I'm ready to go.
Spend family time.
Wait, you mean OCD, superstitious time?
Come on, your dad needs a winner.
Help him out.
Come on.
I can't.
It's the Seahawks.
Put on the jersey and stay, please.
Please.
It's important, please.
What are you up to, Pat?
Nothing, come on.
DOLORES What's in the envelope?
PAT SR. Yeah, what are you doing?
PAT SR. What's in that envelope?
PAT Guys, I'm beating the song!
PAT I'm on the scoreboard!
PAT I'm playing down field!
PAT I feel great!
PAT Tiffany!
PAT (CONT'D) Hey, how you doin'?
PAT (CONT'D) Is Tiffany here?
TIFFANY'S MOTHER What do you want with her?
TIFFANY'S FATHER Is that another creep?
TIFFANY'S FATHER What do you want, creep?
TIFFANY'S FATHER Just beat it.
PAT Whoa, no, no, no.
PAT No, I'm married.
TIFFANY'S FATHER Oh, great, a married creep.
PAT I'm her friend.
PAT (CONT'D) We go running.
PAT (CONT'D) Have you guys not seen us?
PAT (CONT'D) I took her to the diner.
TIFFANY'S MOTHER She's not here.
JORDIE Hi, guys.
JORDIE How's it going?
JORDIE Hey.
JORDIE Is Tiffany home?
TIFFANY'S MOTHER Go away.
JORDIE I know her.
JORDIE I know her, we've dated.
JORDIE We still date.
PAT What are you doing here?
JORDIE I've called her, I've texted her.
PAT Do you know this guy?
JORDIE I still haven't heard back.
JORDIE We used to work together--
TIFFANY'S FATHER Just get the hell out of here...
JORDIE I just wanted to give you my card to give to her.
TIFFANY'S FATHER Another rude creep.
PAT Listen to what he's saying.
PAT Listen to what he's saying.
JORDIE What's he saying?
PAT He's saying you're being rude.
JORDIE How am I being rude?
PAT Oh, you know.
PAT You know.
PAT Come on.
PAT Sometimes it's okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun and
PAT --it's not because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt, and they're an easy target.
PAT And in this case, in this particular case, I think that wing is being fixed.
PAT And you gotta make sure it gets mended.
PAT And you're gettin' in the way of that right now, okay?
PAT Because she's sensitive and she's smart, she's artistic.
PAT This is a great girl and you gotta be respectful of that.
PAT Come on.
PAT (CONT'D) Let me walk you down to your car.
PAT (CONT'D) You're a better guy than this.
PAT (CONT'D) I can see it in your eyes.
JORDIE She just texted me!
PAT Hey!
PAT Hey, wait a second!
PAT What are you doing?
PAT What happened?
PAT How come you weren't outside?
PAT What the hell's going on?
TIFFANY I can't, I can't do it.
PAT What do you mean, you can't do it?
PAT You can't do what?
TIFFANY I can't give the letter to Nikki.
PAT Tiffany, what are you talking about?
PAT What do you mean you can't give the letter to Nikki?
TIFFANY Because what am I getting in return?
TIFFANY What are you doing for me?
PAT You said!
PAT You said if I wrote a letter, you'd get it to Nikki.
TIFFANY I know.
PAT That was the set-up.
TIFFANY Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!
PAT What are you talking about?
PAT You seem like you're a tough girl to me.
PAT Why don't you just do things on your own?
TIFFANY I always get myself in these fucking situations.
TIFFANY I give everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don't get what I want, okay?
TIFFANY I'm not my sister.
Pat takes this in.
PAT Alright, well, ask for you.
PAT What can I do for you?
TIFFANY I can't do it.
PAT Tiffany, what do you want me to do?
PAT (CONT'D) Think of something.
TIFFANY There's this thing.
PAT There's a thing, okay.
PAT What kind of thing?
TIFFANY It's a thing, it's a thing.
TIFFANY It's a, it's a dance thing.
PAT It's a dance thing, all right.
TIFFANY It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel.
TIFFANY Tommy would never do it with me and I missed it every single year.
PAT Well, Tommy's dead, so he's not gonna fucking do it.
TIFFANY Would you please!
PAT I don't have a filter when I talk.
TIFFANY Can we have one conversation without you reminding me that my goddamn husband is dead?
TIFFANY My God.
PAT Yes, I'm sorry.
PAT I'm sorry.
PAT Okay, I'm sorry.
TIFFANY But I can only do it if I have a partner...and now I'm about to miss it for another year.
PAT Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna fuckin' dance with you.
PAT What are you talking about?
TIFFANY What, your schedule is so busy?
TIFFANY "Grapes of Wrath" and watching football with your dad?
PAT Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you.
TIFFANY All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter.
PAT Wait a second!
PAT But you promised you would do this.
TIFFANY Think about it.
PAT Well, I already did do something for you, you know.
PAT I took care of that jerkoff that was in front of your house.
TIFFANY What?
TIFFANY Jordie?
PAT Let me ask you something.
PAT Do you call him when you're lonely?
PAT (CONT'D) That encourages him, Tiffany.
PAT (CONT'D) You shouldn't do it.
TIFFANY Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki?
PAT It's not at all like me and Nikki.
PAT What are you talking about?
PAT We're in love and we're married.
PAT It's completely different.
TIFFANY How are you in love?
TIFFANY Tell me about that.
TIFFANY The big Nikki love.
TIFFANY Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.
PAT We have a very unconventional chemistry, it makes people feel awkward, but not me.
PAT She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with.
TIFFANY Wow.
PAT It's electric between us, okay?
PAT Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay?
PAT And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done.
PAT I mean, people fight.
PAT Couples fight.
PAT We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks.
PAT That's normal.
PAT She always wanted the best for me.
Tiffany listens.
PAT (CONT'D) She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate.
PAT (CONT'D) And that's a good thing.
PAT (CONT'D) You know?
PAT (CONT'D) I just, look, I'm my best self today, and I think she's her best self today, and our love's gonna be fucking amazing.
TIFFANY It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back.
TIFFANY So think about the dance thing.
PAT Danny, you're out of the hospital?
PAT And you're here on game day?
DANNY I'm out.
DANNY (CONT'D) It's official, man.
DANNY (CONT'D) They didn't convert me to my Mental Hygiene Law admission status within two thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence, so I'm out.
DANNY (CONT'D) They had to let me go.
PAT I never understand what he's saying.
PAT SR. Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on, let's come back and sit down the way you were before.
PAT What a treat!
SPORTS ANNOUNCER (over television) (low and indistinct chatter - continues under following scenes and dialogue)
PAT Whoa, whoa, whoa.
PAT Dad's got you sitting here?
PAT SR. Oh, yeah.
DANNY He calls me "Jailhouse Lawyer."
PAT SR. Hold the remote the way you were holding it before.
DANNY Okay.
PAT And now you're holding the remote?
DANNY And it's working.
DANNY Your dad's a genius.
PAT SR.
URGES DANNY TO SIT UP STRAIGHTER with remote.
PAT SR. Now sit up.
PAT And Danny's the good luck charm?
PAT SR. Danny's from you.
PAT SR. This is your house, so it comes down to you.
PAT SR. You're the one.
DANNY Yeah, you're the one, Pat.
PAT Superstition, Danny.
PAT I don't know.
PAT SR. Come sit down.
PAT SR. (CONT'D) Don't disappear doing God knows what with that Tiffany Maxwell.
PAT Dad, Dad, Dad.
PAT She's my friend.
PAT Why would you say that?
RONNIE Oh, she's a mess.
RONNIE You gotta be careful.
RONNIE She goes to a lot of therapy.
PAT I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie.
PAT What are you trying to say?
RONNIE I'm just saying--
PAT Am I messed up?
PAT (CONT'D) Why don't you stop judging people?
PAT (CONT'D) You judge everybody.
PAT (CONT'D) You're the one who has a messed up marriage.
RONNIE I'm just looking out for you, I'm just looking out for you.
RONNIE She's unstable.
DOLORES What's wrong with your marriage?
DOLORES What's wrong with your marriage?
RONNIE Nothing's wrong!
PAT You should have seen when I was at his house.
PAT It's like a circus over there.
RONNIE Shh, shh.
PAT What are you talking about?
PAT I'm not gonna hide this.
PAT You need to deal with it.
RONNIE Stop breaking my balls.
PAT Oh!!!!
RONNIE I got you an iPod.
PAT Whoa!
PAT Is this for me?
Yeah.
Well, that's my old iPod, but-
Oh, buddy, thank you.
That's so nice of you.
Wow.
Thirty-two gigabytes.
How many songs is that?
Seven thousand.
Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers.
You love The Stranglers.
Oh, the Sex Pistols.
The Clash.
Got some Clash.
Oh, "West Side Story."
Yeah, "West Side Story."
It makes me peaceful.
"Maria, I just met a girl named Maria..."
Right, right, right.
And then when I'm angry, which is a lot these days, I go to the garage...Metallica...Megadeth.
I start fucking smashing shit.
You gotta get your marriage together.
I start breaking shit, and I hurt my hand.
And --
Ronnie, that's fucked up.
RONNIE Yeah, but it makes me feel better.
RONNIE It's like my therapy, you know?
PAT When I'm with Nikki, I'm never gonna do stuff like that...
JAKE Whoa, Nikki?
JAKE What's all this about Nikki?
Pan from the framed photo of Jake on foyer wall, to Jake on the stairs above.
JAKE (CONT'D) A restraining order is nothing to fool with, bro.
JAKE (CONT'D) [Walks down to Pat].
JAKE (CONT'D) Holy shit, look at you!
JAKE (CONT'D) You are fit!
JAKE (CONT'D) You look absolutely amazing.
JAKE (CONT'D) You feel good?
PAT How you doing, Jake?
JAKE Good.
JAKE You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime.
DOLORES Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him?
JAKE So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come see you down at the hospital.
JAKE You know how those places creep me out, and the firm's been expanding.
JAKE I've been helping Pop with the restaurant `cause he needs to have a legitimate business.
JAKE He needs a tax return.
JAKE With all the money that he's making with his bookmaking, they're gonna come after him.
JAKE And then it looks like I'm making, I'm gonna make partner at the firm.
Pat just stares at Jake.
The room is silent.
JAKE (CONT'D) Well, I don't even know what to say to you anymore.
JAKE (CONT'D) You lost your wife, I'm getting engaged, and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things.
JAKE (CONT'D) You lost your house, I'm getting a new house.
JAKE (CONT'D) You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm.
PAT SR. Maybe stop talking about all the stuff that's good for you and bad for him.
PAT SR. Just, you know, leave it alone.
PAT SR. We're watching the game.
JAKE You know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna stop talking.
JAKE I'm gonna shut my mouth.
Pat stares down Jake.
Tense.
PAT As my friend Danny would say 00
The room hangs on Pat's words.
PAT (CONT'D) I got nothing but love for you, brother.
DANNY That's right.
DANNY That's right.
RONNIE/RANDY/DANNY/DELORES (O.C.) That's nice.
RONNIE/RANDY/DANNY/DELORES (O.C.) That's nice.
PAT SR. Well, thank God, finally.
PAT DeSean Jackson.
JAKE Yeah.
JAKE Did it fit?
PAT I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.
RONNIE Beautiful jersey.
RONNIE I love that jersey.
PAT Veronica didn't like it.
RONNIE Veronica hates the jersey.
JAKE Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay?
PAT I'm not doing anything!
RONNIE Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble.
DOLORES Pat, you're up to something, I know.
PAT People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me, maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay?
PAT Did you ever think about that?
PAT Maybe we understand something because we're
DANNY We have a sixth sense.
DANNY I mean, everybody's got it.
DANNY Everybody's just not in touch with it.
DOLORES Oh, no.
OFFICER KEOGH How you doing, Pat?
PAT Jesus.
PAT SR. I guess his sixth sense forgot to tell him the cops were coming.
OFFICER KEOGH I'm taking him back to the hospital.
PAT What?
PAT No, no, he passed his thing, right?
DANNY First of all, check with the latest legal development.
OFFICER KEOGH Well, we got a call that they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so....
PAT SR. Wait a minute.
PAT SR. Are you an Eagles fan or are you not an Eagles fan?
OFFICER KEOGH I'm an Eagles fan.
PAT SR. Well then, what's the problem?
PAT SR. He's not goin' anywhere.
PAT SR. Just let him finish the game, that's all.
PAT SR. The handkerchief is working.
PAT SR. We're killing the Seahawks, twenty-seven- ten.
PAT SR. What's the matter with you?
PAT SR. Let him stay, please!
OFFICER KEOGH I don't know what the hell you're talking about "the handkerchief".
OFFICER KEOGH And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, alright?
OFFICER KEOGH He can contest his case from Baltimore.
DANNY Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law.
DANNY You're not correct.
OFFICER KEOGH Come on.
DANNY You guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
TIFFANY I used the insurance money to build this.
TIFFANY I designed it.
TIFFANY All the floors are hard oak.
TIFFANY It has good bounce for dancers.
PAT Wow.
TIFFANY I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares?
TIFFANY It's therapy and it's fun.
TIFFANY And the walls are good `cause I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.
PAT Where do you sleep?
TIFFANY Upstairs.
TIFFANY It's a garage, I just renovated it.
TIFFANY You know, I was thinking about putting a ballet barre here.
PAT When are you gonna give it to her?
TIFFANY What?
PAT The letter to Nikki.
TIFFANY Probably tonight.
PAT Really?
TIFFANY Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight.
PAT Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph.
PAT I did this thing about Shakespeare and how it's very
TIFFANY Mm-hmm.
PAT -and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing, I can be able to do that because of all the
TIFFANY No, that's good, that's really good.
PAT I assume you're a good teacher.
TIFFANY Yeah.
TIFFANY I mean, I hope so.
PAT Maybe you can teach us both, you know what I mean?
PAT (CONT'D) And I also mentioned how generous it is, what I'm doing for you.
TIFFANY Yeah.
TIFFANY Mm-hmm.
TIFFANY It's really generous.
PAT You know, being of service.
TIFFANY Yeah.
PAT To your need.
TIFFANY Uh-huh.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) All right, let's start simple.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Start at that corner, walk towards me.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Walk across the room.
Pat stands in the corner, doesn't move.
PAT Can we do something else besides the dance deal?
TIFFANY Are you fucking kidding me?
PAT I'm good with a hammer.
PAT You want me to fix something?
TIFFANY A deal is a deal.
PAT I know.
PAT Okay.
PAT I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario.
TIFFANY Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki.
TIFFANY And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk.
TIFFANY By your slow walk.
TIFFANY You can't talk.
PAT I'm not doing it.
TIFFANY Only walk.
TIFFANY Do it.
PAT No.
PAT That's stupid.
TIFFANY No walk, no letter.
TIFFANY Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on.
TIFFANY Do it.
TIFFANY I'm Nikki.
TIFFANY Come on.
PAT You're not Nikki.
TIFFANY Don't look up until you're halfway here.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) That's right.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Not yet.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Yes.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Do you feel that?
TIFFANY (CONT'D) That's emotion.
PAT I don't feel anything.
TIFFANY Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?
PAT No.
TIFFANY We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him.
TIFFANY But for the last couple months, I just wasn't into sex at all.
TIFFANY It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed.
TIFFANY Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself.
TIFFANY I don't think that makes me a criminal.
TIFFANY Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going.
TIFFANY And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed.
TIFFANY And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat.
TIFFANY (pause) That's a feeling.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Okay, this is the waltz.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) I'm gonna teach you the waltz step.
AROUND HER as she showed him, his hands on his shoulders.
PAT LIES ON BED STARES AT CEILING, emotions churning inside.
DOLORES Whoa!
DOLORES Slow down.
PAT What?
DOLORES Your father wanted you to have this.
PAT He wants me to have-
PAT (CONT'D) -all this Eagles information.
DOLORES It's his living.
PAT Um, tell Dad thanks.
DOLORES Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat.
TIFFANY Football stays out of this place, so does "Lord of the Flies."
PAT Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you doing?
PAT I'm behind on my syllabus.
TIFFANY I don't give a fuck.
PAT What the hell are you doing?
PAT Hey, hey!
PAT Did you just throw that outside?
TIFFANY What?
TIFFANY You're not gonna read that shit on my time.
TIFFANY I can tell you all about the "Lord of the Flies."
TIFFANY It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk.
TIFFANY And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power.
TIFFANY And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a murder.
TIFFANY I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.
PAT Wow.
PAT That was a great synopsis.
PAT I still need to read it, though.
PAT (CONT'D) Who's that?
PAT (CONT'D) What the....?
PAT (CONT'D) (laughing) What are you doing here, man?
DANNY If one of your two supervising physicians loses their license, then your whole ajudication is thrown out.
PAT How'd you know we were here?
DANNY I went by your parents' house looking for you and they told me you was over here.
PAT Danny, this is Tiffany.
PAT (to Tiffany) Tiffany, this is Danny.
TIFFANY Hello.
TIFFANY Pat told me about you.
DANNY So is the girl, that you wrote about?
PAT Yeah.
TIFFANY What?
TIFFANY He wrote about me?
TIFFANY I'm "the girl"?
DANNY He wrote about you, all right.
TIFFANY What'd he say?
DANNY He said you guys was helping each other out and you were nice and had a mouth on you, that you were mouthy, but--
PAT Whoa, whoa, that's enough.
TIFFANY No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter.
PAT Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll just tell you.
PAT It was nothing.
PAT It was just a very general letter.
TIFFANY Cool.
DANNY She's fine.
PAT She is my friend with an "F."
DANNY A capital "F."
PAT For "friend."
The three stand there awkwardly for a beat.
DANNY Hey, can I see what you guys are doing?
PAT Yeah.
TIFFANY Okay.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) And then this goes into something else.
DANNY That's it?
PAT Why?
PAT What is it, what is it, what is it.
DANNY Can I say something?
DANNY Do you mind?
TIFFANY No.
DANNY You sure?
PAT Just say it.
PAT Say it.
TIFFANY No, please.
DANNY I think Pat, you should be facing Tiffany.
DANNY (CONT'D) Let me show you, Pat, let me show you what I mean.
DANNY (CONT'D) You gotta come at her with a little bit more soul, man.
DANNY (CONT'D) You should move more hips.
DANNY (CONT'D) Just, just sort of come in, Pat, come in like this.
DANNY (CONT'D) And....
PAT Okay.
DANNY Yeah.
DANNY Can you move `em a little bit more?
DANNY Yeah, that's it.
DANNY Move `em a bit more.
DANNY (CONT'D) You could turn around, too, there's nothing wrong with that.
DANNY (CONT'D) Yeah.
DANNY (CONT'D) You're pretty good.
DANNY (CONT'D) Mm, yeah.
PAT Okay, we got it, we got it.
DANNY Okay.
DANNY Okay.
DANNY (CONT'D) Come on, Pat, come on.
DANNY (CONT'D) A little bit more soul.
DANNY (CONT'D) Black it up, Pat.
PAT "Black it up"?
DANNY You know damn well what it means.
DANNY (CONT'D) Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
DANNY (CONT'D) Oh, man!
DANNY (CONT'D) I got an idea.
DANNY (CONT'D) Come get some, Pat.
DANNY (CONT'D) Come get some.
DANNY (CONT'D) Shuffle back, shuffle back.
DANNY (CONT'D) Shuffle back, shuffle back.
DANNY (CONT'D) Girl, you gotta move your junk.
DANNY (CONT'D) I gotta get out of here.
DANNY (CONT'D) I gotta go see this girl, Tanya.
DANNY (CONT'D) She lives on this side of town.
PAT Yeah, go see Tanya.
PAT Good idea.
DANNY Okay, man, hey.
DANNY I'm gonna be there, man.
DANNY I want you guys to win!
TIFFANY Bye!
DANNY Excelsior, Pat!
PAT Excelsior!
DANNY That's my man.
PAT SR. Hey.
PAT SR. Patty.
(CONT'D) Pat.
PAT SR. (CONT'D) Patty.
PAT SR. (CONT'D) Where have you been?
PAT SR. (CONT'D) Huh?
(CONT'D) We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that.
Pat looks concerned, he could be in trouble.
PAT SR. (CONT'D) We gotta beat the Giants if we wanna have a chance of getting into the division, any chance of playing in the playoffs.
PAT SR. (CONT'D) Do you realize that?
PAT I didn't realize that.
PAT SR. Yeah, that's the bind we're in.
PAT SR. I mean, I think it would be wise if we spent father-son time, reading about the Eagles, talking about them, just to strengthen the good luck thing that you're in.
PAT Okay.
PAT SR. Yeah?
PAT Right.
PAT SR. Hmm?
(CONT'D) I just wanted to, maybe I didn't, spend enough time with you growing up.
(CONT'D) I spent too much time with your brother.
(CONT'D) It might have made you feel worse about your behavior, but I didn't know anything, I didn't know how to handle it.
(CONT'D) I mean, that's what all this Eagles stuff is about.
(CONT'D) It's about us, spending time now.
(CONT'D) I wanna do everything I can to help you get back on your feet.
(CONT'D) That's the whole point.
(CONT'D) Yeah.
(CONT'D) I wish you'd watch these games with me so we could talk, we could get into things.
(CONT'D) (inhales) So would you, would you just come downstairs and talk to me and Randy now?
PAT SR. Randy, tell him what I'm doing.
RANDY He's betting everything on the Giant game.
RANDY Everything.
RANDY (CONT'D) All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game.
PAT SR. Tell him why.
RANDY Because he believes in you.
PAT Is that true?
PAT SR. I believe in you, Patty.
PAT SR. I believe in you.
PAT SR. I want you to know that.
PAT SR. So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.
(CONT'D) You understand?
PAT Yeah.
PAT SR. Heavy.
PAT SR. I want you to go to the game with your brother.
PAT You want me to go to the game with Jake?
PAT SR. Of course I do.
JAKE Does he want me to go?
PAT SR. Of course he wants you to go.
PAT He told you that?
PAT SR. He told me, yes.
PAT Even with all his friends?
PAT SR. With all his friends.
PAT SR. He trusts you.
PAT He's not embarrassed?
PAT SR. No.
PAT SR. I'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know, I'm banned from the stadium.
PAT SR. `Cause I'd love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole.
RANDY Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet.
RANDY As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.
PAT SR. Randy.
PAT SR. (to Pat) I just hope you heard what I said.
PAT SR. It's like a family business, it's our family endeavor.
PAT SR. We all stick together on this.
PAT SR. That's how it works.
PAT SR. That's a positive, positive vibe.
PAT I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad.
PAT It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's--, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.
PAT SR. What is this thing you're doing?
DOLORES Yeah, what is it?
DOLORES What is this project, hon?
PAT It's a dance thing, okay?
PAT There's nothing more to it, Dad.
PAT I swear.
PAT Listen, I need to ask you something.
PAT (CONT'D) Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game?
TIFFANY I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.
PAT Why?
TIFFANY These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move.
TIFFANY It's not ready yet.
TIFFANY And we don't have a move yet.
PAT I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him, okay?
PAT And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because I'm spending time with you.
TIFFANY Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?
PAT No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games.
TIFFANY Guess what?
PAT What?
TIFFANY Nikki replied to your letter.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) But you can't read it until after you nail the big move.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Go.
PAT Tiff, I'm sorry.
PAT I can't do anything else without reading Nikki's letter, okay?
PAT It's just--, it's in the back of my head.
PAT We don't almost have it, all right?
TIFFANY I just hope you can handle it.
PAT Thank you.
PAT (CONT'D) What was her energy when she gave it to you?
TIFFANY She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.
PAT She was scared?
PAT About what?
PAT Did she tell you?
TIFFANY Try to stay positive.
PAT I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay?
PAT Because if she says anything that's, you know, is that too much to ask?
TIFFANY No.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) I thought you were gonna read it out loud.
PAT Okay.
PAT Sorry.
PAT (CONT'D) "Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany.
PAT (CONT'D) This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe.
PAT (CONT'D) I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were.
PAT (CONT'D) I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings.
PAT (CONT'D) I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school.
PAT (CONT'D) I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree.
PAT (CONT'D) I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life.
PAT (CONT'D) In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage.
PAT (CONT'D) Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately.
PAT (CONT'D) Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it.
PAT (CONT'D) I'm glad you're doing so well.
PAT (CONT'D) Love, Nikki."
PAT FOLDS UP THE LETTER AGAIN.
He is kind of crying.
PAT (CONT'D) I think I'm done for today, okay?
TIFFANY She said to show her something, Pat.
TIFFANY This dance can be that something.
TIFFANY You would have never done something like this in a million years.
TIFFANY It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline.
TIFFANY It's romantic, like I said it would be.
TIFFANY It's for her.
PAT Thanks for the letter.
PAT I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
PEOPLE (indistinct chatter - continues under following scenes
PAT Can I use your phone?
PAT SR. Is it an emergency?
PAT Yeah, kind of.
PAT SR. What kind of emergency?
PAT Well, I'm just doing this project with Tiffany and I wanted to tell her I'm not gonna be on time.
PAT SR. Just don't make her an emergency, that crazy girl, you know?
PAT She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow Jake's phone.
PAT It's too bad you can't come in to the stadium, but I know you were kicked out, you know, for beating everybody up.
PAT Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad?
PAT SR. That a bad thing?
PAT No, I think, it's a good thing.
PAT SR. Don't drink too much.
PAT SR. Don't hit anybody.
PAT SR. You'll be fine.
PAT Yeah.
PAT I'm solid.

RONNIE Because she brings me down, man!
RONNIE She just brings me down.
PAT You have to change.
PAT You're not gonna throw the marriage away.

FAN #1 (CONT'D) Nasty Indian curry!

PAT I'm not gonna fight.
PAT (CONT'D) Hey, not my brother!
PAT (CONT'D) Hey, hey, hey!
COP Break it up or you'll be arrested!
PAT SR. What'd you do?
PAT SR. (CONT'D) What happened?
PAT SR. What the fuck happened?
PAT Dad.
PAT SR. The birds lose, I lose a fuckin' fortune, a fortune to Randy!
PAT SR. What the fuck did you do?!
PAT SR. You fucking lost it!
PAT SR. I thought you said you had it together!
PAT SR. You were solid!
PAT I am solid.
PAT I was solid at the game, Dad.
PAT I'm solid, I'm solid now.
PAT SR. You fell apart!
PAT SR. What are you fucking talking about?!
DR. PATEL Your son was trying to--
PAT SR. It's all fucking ruined now.
PAT SR. It's all ruined.

PAT No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't!
PAT SR. It's all ruined, you little fucking shit!

PAT I didn't do a fucking thing!
PAT Come on, Dad!
PAT SR. You loser!
PAT SR. You loser!
PAT I'm not a loser.
PAT SR. You fucking loser!
PAT SR. You ruined everything!
DR. PATEL He was defending his brother!
PAT SR. You fucking idiot!
PAT SR. You spike the ball on the one yard line, you fucking idiot!
(CONT'D) Who is this?!
(CONT'D) Who's this?!
TIFFANY We need to talk right now!
TIFFANY When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up!
PAT Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany,
PAT SR. Who is this?
PAT SR. What is this?
TIFFANY Oh, really?
Yes.
I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my dad was pulling me in one direction.
Doctor Patel, Ronnie--
Well, that sounds great, Pat.
That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help.
I'm Tiffany, by the way.
What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell?
There's no craziness.
I told you who she was, I was doing this thing with her.
We had a conversation!
She's fucking nuts!
When you started spending time with her, it all fell apart.
This is the fucking reason right here.
You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you?
Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since--
You think that I'm why today's happened?
That's right, you are why today happened.
I'm the reason why today happened?
I think so.
Let's talk about that.
Be my guest.
The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six.
The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.
She's right, Dad.
The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen.
Wow.
The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two.
Oh, wow.
Let me think about that.
Wait a minute.
Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven.
He was with you?
He was with me.
We went for a run.
Really?
That's crazy.
TIFFANY There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.
JAKE She's making a lot of sense, Pop.
JAKE That's all right on all counts.
TIFFANY Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York?
TIFFANY Huh?
TIFFANY Anybody?
TIFFANY (to Pat Sr.)
TIFFANY Do you?
TIFFANY Do you know?
TIFFANY "Excelsior."
TIFFANY Look it up.
TIFFANY Yeah, "Excelsior."
DOLORES Oh Pat.
TIFFANY Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.
RONNIE Unbelievable.
PAT Wow.
PAT How did you know all that stuff?
TIFFANY I did my research.
PAT SR. Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.
TIFFANY Thank you.
PAT SR. I gotta rethink this whole thing.
PAT SR. I didn't trust it before, but I gotta say, now I do.
Oh, now you like her, Dad?
I have to say I do.
Yup.
Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know?
You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.
Oh, fuck off, Randy.
You love it.
You live for this shit.
You've been betting against my father for years.
Is that right?
You're twisting the knife right now.
You get off on it!
That's bullshit!
That's not true!
Don't say that!
You get off on it!
If not, then prove it.
Prove it.
Yeah, prove it, prove it!
How do you want me to prove it?
How's he gonna prove it?
By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week?
Is that what you're saying?
No.
She pauses, turns dramatically to Randy.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Against the Cowboys.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) That's your team isn't it, Randy?
PAT That's his team!
TIFFANY I know who his team is.
RANDY When is the game?
TIFFANY December twenty-eight, last game of the season.
PAT Oh, my God.
TIFFANY Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.
DOLORES Oh God.
PAT SR. Randy, I thought they were America's Team.
PAT SR. Don't you believe in America's Team?
TIFFANY Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?
RANDY Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing.
PAT SR. I like it.
DOLORES No.
DOLORES No, Patrizio--
I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son, I'll take the action.
I'll take it.
Dad!
Patrizio, don't!
It's toxic!
I have faith, I have faith.
Excelsior belongs in this house--
--not in the State of New York.
In this house.
Dad, listen to me.
I didn't know that "Excelsior" was the state motto of New York, okay?
I didn't know, either, but now I know.
I know, but listen to me, this is toxic.
Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic, you shouldn't be doing this, you shouldn't be doing--
Randy, what do you say-- (to Pat) Be quiet, shut up.
You already did enough.
(to Randy) Randy, what do you say?
My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored by one and a half points.
I'll give you three more.
Patrizio, stop it!
And Randy, don't you take the bet!
In fact, I'll give you ten points.
No, Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
You have to take that bet on the Cowboys.
Dolores, would you stop him?
Jesus!
How could you not take that bet?
Even with the ten points I give you, that's an insane spread to your advantage.
Cowboys are cowards.
And I'll bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten.
Plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the dance thing.
(to Tiffany) What's that?
Tiffany, what's that?
What?
No, no, no, no.
You're crazy to give away that many points.
That's ridiculous!
I won't take that!
However, wait a second.
I do like the idea of a parlay.
What?
No parlay!
No!
No, don't do it.
Don't do it.
Pat, how do they run this dance competition?
I mean, how do they score it and everything?
I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score!
We're participating.
We're not, we're not a part of it.
There are people, this is a high- end dance contest.
I don't know.
Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy.
Don't--
TIFFANY They go by the Philadelphia rules.
TIFFANY Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest.
TIFFANY You have to average the four judges' scores.
RANDY Okay, score is from one to ten, right?
RANDY And you guys are how good?
PAT We suck.
TIFFANY We don't suck.
TIFFANY Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.
RANDY And how are the people you're competing against?
TIFFANY They're good.
TIFFANY Some of them are professionals.
RANDY They're good?
RANDY Better than you?
Pause.
Tiffany says nothing.
PAT A lot better.
RANDY A lot better.
RANDY So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right?
PAT No, no, that would be amazing if we got five.
PAT Let's not get away--
TIFFANY Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten!
TIFFANY Gimme a break!
TIFFANY Gimme me a break!
PAT We can't get five!
PAT SR. Give `em a five.
PAT SR. Give `em a five.
We can do a five.
What are you talking about, Dad?
You haven't even seen us dance!
That's the parlay.
Will somebody please explain to me the parlay?
Please?
You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing.
For Pat Sr.
to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance.
That's very, very manic indeed.
That's the parlay.
Shake on it.
You know what?
I'm not gonna be a part of this.
(to Randy) Randy, Randy, you're a sickness.
You're a fucking sickness, Randy.
I'm out.
Pat, you can't quit.
I'm not doing the dance.
I'm out.
Pat, calm down.
Thank about it.
See you later.
Pat, no.
What are you doing?
Pat.
PAT I'm out.
PAT SR. Here we are again at the one yard line.
PAT SR. DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
PAT SR. There you go.
PAT What does that even mean, Dad?
PAT I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson.
PAT It doesn't matter anymore okay?
PAT Just because I have the fucking jersey on...I'm not gonna do it.
PAT I'm sorry.
TIFFANY You are not a stand up guy right now.
TIFFANY If it's me reading the signs...if it's me reading the
PAT If it's you reading the signs?
PAT You're reading the signs?
PAT Oh, okay.
DOLORES Pat!
TIFFANY You are not a stand up guy!
DOLORES Pat!
DOLORES I told you not to push it.
PAT SR. Yeah, but he's gotta do this thing.
PAT SR. He can't be a quitter.
PAT SR. He cannot be a quitter.
DOLORES You took that stupid parlay thing, and now he won't do the dance and it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it.
TIFFANY There's only one way to get him to show.
PAT SR. What's that?
DOLORES Oh, what's that?
TIFFANY We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there.
They stare at her.
DOLORES She won't come.
DOLORES She can't come.
TIFFANY We have to tell him that she's coming.
PAT SR. We have to tell him that she's going.
DOLORES But that's a lie!
TIFFANY It's a white lie.
PAT SR. It's a white lie, what's that matter?
PAT SR. That's no big deal.
PAT SR. So it's a little lie.
TIFFANY There's no other way.
PAT SR. You know, we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs so that he can live his life without ruining it.
DOLORES No.
DOLORES I don't approve.
DOLORES You can't do it.
PAT SR. Well, you know, I didn't approve when you called her and you told her where he was running, so she could ambush him.
PAT SR. I didn't approve of that, but you did it anyway, so I'm doing this anyway.
PAT SR. That's it.
TIFFANY We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there.
PAT SR. You gotta be part of it.
TIFFANY We have to do it.
DOLORES Aren't you nervous to be lying?
TIFFANY Yeah.
TIFFANY A little bit.
TIFFANY But it's for the best.
PAT "...but if it was me reading the signs...."
THE LETTER.
HE JUST FIGURED SOMETHING OUT: Tiffany wrote the letter, not Nikki.
STOPS AND LOOKS BACK AT THE HOUSE then at the sky -- he can't believe Tiffany lied to him.
Emotions course through him.
PAT SR. That's it.
DOLORES Okay.
TIFFANY Hey.
PAT Hey, what's up?
PAT Sorry I'm late.
TIFFANY It's fine.
HE WATCHES HER CAREFULLY, stares at her.
Thinking.
TIFFANY'S MOTHER Is everything all right?
PAT SR. Everything is fine.
PAT SR. Cheers.
SHE FUMBLES.
She is agitated as he studies her.
TIFFANY This isn't working!
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Stupid!
TIFFANY (CONT'D) This just isn't working!
PAT Come on, it's gonna be great.
PAT Nikki's gonna be there.
PAT You know?
PAT Everything's gonna come together.
PAT It's what's meant to be.
PAT You okay?
PAT (CONT'D) Don't get wobbly on me.
TIFFANY I'm not.
PAT We have a dance to do.
PAT We have a parlay.
PAT You gotta stay focused.
TIFFANY I'm focused.
PAT Okay, let's go.
PAT Look at the dancers.
PAT You see them?
TIFFANY Shit.
PAT SR. Hey, Randy, Jake.
PAT SR. What do we got?
JAKE Dallas just tied with another field goal, three-three.
JAKE I'm worried about the bet.
PAT SR. Don't worry about the bet.

PAT SR. Let me tell you, I know you don't wanna listen to your father, I didn't listen to mine but I'm telling you, you gotta pay attention to the signs.
PAT SR. When life reaches out with a moment like this, it's a sin if you don't reach back.
PAT SR. I'm telling you, it's a sin if you don't reach back, and it'll haunt you for the rest of your days like a curse.

TIFFANY "Dear Tiffany...
SHE STOPS, surprised it is addressed to her.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) "...I know you wrote the letter.
TIFFANY (CONT'D) (long pause) The only way you could meet my crazy...."
PAT "...was by doing something crazy yourself.
PAT Thank you.
PAT I love you.
