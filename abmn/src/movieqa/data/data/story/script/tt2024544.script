We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A
WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN.
It's not a high end piece, but it is quite nice.
WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study.
Sitting in a chair with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late twenties.
Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner, is distinguished.
But he, too, seems a hardy individual.
Someone who has known manual labor in his time.
Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing the strings, their tuning.
Satisfied, Solomon begins to play vigorously.
As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:
We come in on a lively affair.
A dinner party is being thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house.
In attendance are EIGHT COUPLES.
All are WHITE and all are FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties.
The men and women are dressed in very fine attire.
We should get the sense that for the most part they are people of means.
The furniture has been set aside in the living room.
At the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a
The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon, having cut directly from the tune he was previously playing.
He plays with a light determination, and in no way seems possessed with empty servitude.
Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal thanks and congratulations from all.
It should be clear that despite their respective races there is much admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.
It is a Saturday morning.
Clad in her finest attire is ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he.
We see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and ALONZO who is five.
They are handsome, and well groomed kids.
Anne straightens up the children.
She finishes,
2.
3 CONTINUED: 3 she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if preparing to pose for a portrait.
They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.
He stands and looks admiringly at his family.
ADMIRINGLY stressed.
It isn't that he doesn't have love for them, he does as well.
But in the moment, he truly admires his greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and well and provided for.
He goes to his children, and hands each a coin, then goes to Anne.
Gives her a kiss on the cheek.
The children giggle at the sight.
Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets and groves of Saratoga.
The streets are well populated this morning with many people out strolling.
Most are WHITE, but there are BLACKS as well.
They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly easily - though not always completely - with the whites.
We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their WHITE MASTERS.
These pairings are largely from the south and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are not physically downtrodden, not field hands.
They are well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" - comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.
As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart traffic.
Solomon and his children easily jump across the muck.
Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for Solomon to help her across.
ANNE Solomon...
ANNE Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile
waving her forward:
SOLOMON Come, Anne.
SOLOMON Jump.
The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.
Jump.
You can make it.
I've done it.
You can make it.
ANNE I will not ruin my dress.
ANNE Catch me!
3.
SOLOMON I will catch you, Anne.
I will.
Again, lightly stern:
ANNE You will.
ANNE As Solomon and his family make their way, among the slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.
ANNE As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon and his family as they enter A STORE.
ANNE His intrigue of this most handsome and harmonious group should be obvious.
With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the STORE.
Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.
Suddenly a voice barks out-
Jasper!
Come on!
We are inside the store of MR.
CEPHAS PARKER; a white man and a supplier of general goods.
Solomon greets him
SOLOMON Mr. Parker.
PARKER Mr. Northup.
PARKER Mrs. Northup.
With money in hand the Northup children move quickly about the store looking for items to purchase.
Anne looks over some silks and fabrics.
Parker suggests
A new cravat, Solomon?
Pure silk by way of the French.
SOLOMON We are in need of a fresh carry all for the Mrs's travels.
PARKER A year's passed?
PARKER Off to Sandy Hill?
ANNE I am.
ANNE Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL from an upper shelf.
PARKER Something to suit your style, but sturdy enough for the forty miles round trip.
PARKER Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it.
ANNE It's beautiful.
At what price?
ANNE We will take it.
ANNE Children, come see what your father has just purchased for me.
ANNE As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered the store.
ANNE At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe.
ANNE Before the
book sits a LEDGER.
Mr. Parker asks of Solomon:
PARKER If you would sign our condolence book.
PARKER My hope is to find a way to forward it to the Widow Harrison.
PARKER Sad days for the nation.
SOLOMON Yes, certainly.
SOLOMON Poor Mrs. Harris and her children.
SOLOMON I hope brighter times ahead.
4A.
Jasper looks scared, timid.
It's as though he'd like to engage, but is unsure of as to how.
Noting Jasper, Parker
PARKER A moment, sir, and you will be assisted.
SOLOMON If we could discuss the price...
5.
PARKER Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.
PARKER A customer waits.
PARKER Welcome, sir.
To Jasper, with good nature:
SOLOMON Shop well, but mind your wallet.
PARKER Ignore the gentleman's nonsense.
PARKER Now, may I interest you in a new cravat?
PARKER Pure silk by way of the-- Before Parker can finish, the door opens.
PARKER It's Jasper's Master, FITZGERALD.
PARKER He's stern, clearly displeased.
FITZGERALD Jasper!
My regrets for the intrusion.
SOLOMON No intrusion.
SOLOMON Fitzgerald looks to Solomon.
SOLOMON It is a cold glare as though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a
response from a black man.
Looking back to Parker:
FITZGERALD Good day, sir.
Anne, busy in the kitchen, puts the final touches to the meal, which is just about to begin.
Solomon, in the meanwhile, sits at the head of the table reading from a NEWSPAPER.
He reads to his children solemn news of the funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President Harrison.
SOLOMON "Thus has passed away from earth our late President."
SOLOMON Solomon starts from the top of the article.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) "During the morning, from sunrise, the heavy bells had been pealing forth their slow and solemn toll while the minute guns announced that soon the grave would receive its trust.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Our city as well as our entire nation has been called to weep over the fall of a great and good man.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) One who was by the wishes of a large majority of our
5A.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) people raised to fill the highest place of trust within their gift.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) William Henry Harrison."
SOLOMON (CONT'D) A long moment of quiet, the family continuing to eat.
Then, from Margaret:
MARGARET Will you read it again?
ANNE Not just now, darling.
ANNE Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at the center of the table.
ANNE As she takes a seat, all heads are bowed.
MARGARET For food that stays our hunger, For rest that brings us ease, For homes where memories linger, We give our thanks for these.
Amen.
SOLOMON Margaret, that was wonderful.
MARGARET Thank you, Papa.
SOLOMON Alonzo, do you have something to say?
ALONZO Yes, I helped Momma make this.
ANNE Yes, and you were such a good help.
ANNE Especially making the gravy.
MARGARET Papa, I would very much like to learn how to play the violin.
MARGARET Could you teach me?
ALONZO Me too!
MARGARET Yes, but I asked Papa first.
SOLOMON Both of you, calm down.
SOLOMON We will have our first lesson after this wonderful dinner.
SOLOMON And on that note, let's start eating.
5B.
The family all tuck in to their meal.
The scene is one of warmth and happiness.
6.
Solomon and Anne have fun and difficulty putting the unruly children to bed.
They are tucked in, and each given a kiss good night.
As Margaret lays down to sleep, Anne blows out the candle darkening the room.
Silhouetted in the doorway, Solomon takes Anne in his arms, holds her tightly as they both luxuriate in the simple, beautiful gift that is their children.
Now alone together, we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in each other's arms.
Beyond being physically close, emotionally close, they are just so very comfortable with one another.
They are the very representation of a couple who are made for each other.
They look at each other for a prolonged time.
Three weeks.
Two days.
ANNE It is the custom.
ANNE I wonder what you'll do without me?
SOLOMON I won't stay idle.
SOLOMON SOLOMON's eyes lower.
ANNE Darling, it's good money.
SOLOMON If only I didn't have to share your cooking with other people.
SOLOMON ANNE holds his gaze.
ANNE You don't.
ANNE They kiss.
7.
We are just outside the Northup house.
A CARRIAGE waits with a DRIVER.
Anne and the children are dressed for travel - Anne sporting HER NEW CARRY ALL.
The Driver loads bags into the carriage.
For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss.
SOLOMON Travel safely.
ANNE Stay safely.
ANNE Anne and the children loaded up, the Driver chides the horse and the carriage heads off.
ANNE Solomon waves a hearty good bye to his wife and children.
Solomon is now out for a stroll.
He passes two men - two in particular - who stand outside conversing with MR.
MOON himself: MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON.
Brown is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and intelligence.
Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair complexion and light eyes.
Both are finely, if perhaps a bit garishly, dressed.
Hamilton, as Solomon describes him, slightly effeminate.
Moon, spotting Solomon:
MR. MOON Call the Devil's name...
MR. MOON There he is now.
MR. MOON Mr. Northup...!
MR. MOON I have two gentlemen who should make your acquaintance.
MR. MOON Messrs.
MR. MOON Brown and Hamilton.
BROWN Sir.
MR. MOON Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen were inquiring about distinguished individuals, and I was just this very moment telling them that Solomon Northup is an expert player on the violin.
HAMILTON He was indeed.
SOLOMON Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.
BROWN Taking into consideration his graciousness and your modesty, may we trouble you for a moment of your time to converse, sir?
We make a jump to a green space.
Solomon, Brown and Hamilton are sitting at a bench.
SOLOMON A circus?
HAMILTON That is our usual employee.
HAMILTON The company currently in the city of Washington.
BROWN Circus too constricting a word to describe the talented and merry band with which we travel.
BROWN It is a spectacle unlike most have ever witnessed.
BROWN Creatures from the darkest Africa as yet unseen by civilized man.
BROWN Acrobats from the Orient able to contort themselves in the most confounding manners.
HAMILTON And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown; an internationally renowned practitioner in the art of prestidigitation.
BROWN We are on our way thither to rejoin the company having left for a short time to make a small profit from our own exhibitions.
HAMILTON The reason for our inquiry with Mr. Moon...
BROWN Yes.
BROWN We had just a devil of a time in procuring music for our
BROWN (CONT'D) entertainments.
BROWN (CONT'D) Men of true talent seemingly in short supply.
SOLOMON Thank you sir...
BROWN If we could persuade you to accompany us as far as New York...
BROWN We would give you one dollar for each day's service and three dollars for every night played at our performances.
BROWN In addition we would provide sufficient pay for the expenses of your return from New York here to Saratoga.
SOLOMON You understand this is all very sudden.
HAMILTON Consider it an opportunity to see
SOLOMON It's intriguing...
HAMILTON If there is any way in which you would give consideration to the offer...
HAMILTON Solomon gives the whole deal one last consideration.
SOLOMON The payment offered is enticement enough, as is my desire to visit the metropolis.
HAMILTON We are delighted, sir.
HAMILTON So delighted.
HAMILTON Though we would add that our travel plans--
BROWN We would like to depart with haste.
10.
SOLOMON As luck would have it, my wife and children are traveling.
SOLOMON I will write her of our plans.
BROWN Excellent!
BROWN I would beg you collect yourself, then we may proceed.
Back in his house, we see Solomon packing: putting some clothes in a travel case, and collecting his violin as well.
Solomon sits down to write a letter; pen poised over paper with already a few lines written.
But Solomon thinks better of it.
WITH LITTLE THOUGHT HE TEARS THE
Solomon enters the buggy, carpet bag in hand.
Brown and Hamilton are waiting.
They ride in a covered carriage led by a pair of "noble" horses.
HAMILTON No letter to post?
SOLOMON No need.
SOLOMON My return will coincide with my family's.
BROWN We're off then.
We find ourselves in a roadside pub.
It serves the purpose of drinking and diversion, and little more.
As Solomon plays his violin, Brown and Hamilton perform a decent, paired magic routine before a SPARSE AUDIENCE NOT
11.
After the show, the pub now fairly empty, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat.
Hamilton and Brown drink, but again Solomon abstains.
Though Solomon remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little money was collected.
HAMILTON Not an additional tip from a one of them.
HAMILTON They expect to be entertained for nothing.
BROWN And not satisfied a bit despite giving them more than what they paid for.
SOLOMON It's the national mood.
SOLOMON There's too much grief to make room for frivolity.
HAMILTON My sincerest apologies, Solomon.
HAMILTON You were promised opportunity, and you were given none.
BROWN The opportunity is with the circus.
BROWN A two man show poorly promoted, what were we to expect?
BROWN But the circus bills itself.
HAMILTON True.
BROWN I have told you of the circus with which we are connected.
BROWN Creatures from the darkest of Africa.
BROWN Acrobats from the Orient who--
SOLOMON You have described it, yes.
BROWN Yes.
BROWN We need to return immediately to Washington.
BROWN Solomon...I believe us familiar enough now, but forgive me if I am bold...would you consider making the trip with us?
BROWN Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea.
12.
HAMILTON Entertaining at pubs and inns has it's place, but a man of your skills deserves better.
BROWN Hear, hear.
HAMILTON And more importantly you would build your own name and following.
HAMILTON The circus tends to attract those with the highest of reputations.
HAMILTON An introduction here and there could amount to a lifetime of reward.
HAMILTON Now would be the time.
HAMILTON With your family away, an opportunity presents itself.
BROWN Said as fellow artists as well as businessmen.
BROWN Well worth the effort at least.
SOLOMON You present a flattering representation.
SOLOMON As my family will be traveling back shortly, perhaps I might commit only to one trial engagement.
HAMILTON Oh, very good, sir.
HAMILTON Very good.
HAMILTON I cannot recall being so excited.
BROWN There is a practical concern.
BROWN If you are to continue on with us you should obtain your free papers.
SOLOMON Not necessary.
BROWN Here in New York, no.
BROWN But we will be entering slave states and as a matter of precaution...
BROWN It's to all our benefit we should not have to come to account for your well being.
HAMILTON Six shillings worth of effort could well save much trouble later.
BROWN We'll go to the Customs House in the morning, then travel on.
BROWN Good business all around.
13.
The city is a swarm of people.
At the moment the populace is displaying both sorrow and anticipation.
Sorrow for the loss of the President.
Many are dressed in black, and black crepe hangs nearly everywhere.
Black armbands are frequently seen, and the occasional American Flag hung at half mast.
As well, there are portraits of Harrison at varying locations.
Having arrived in Washington, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown
A decent though crowded, boisterous and smoke-filled joint.
Very lively.
Solomon, Hamilton and Brown are among several parties drinking in the hotel's bar.
As with seemingly everywhere in the city black crepes accessorize the background.
Brown counts out $43.00 IN COIN on the tabletop.
Solomon is astonished by the amount.
BROWN Forty-three dollars.
BROWN All to you.
SOLOMON That...it's far more than my wages amount to.
BROWN Consider the remainder an advance from the circus.
BROWN I cannot tell you...I honestly wish you had seen the expression of our director when I described your abilities.
BROWN He was fairly overcome with excitement.
HAMILTON You should have invited him to sup with us.
BROWN I did.
BROWN I did, but so many preparations before the company is to depart.
BROWN Tomorrow we shall prepare for our Washington debut.
BROWN But tonight, our thoughts are with the great man
BROWN (CONT'D) for whom this city prepared solemn memorial.
BROWN (CONT'D) He has passed from the praise of men to receive the plaudit of his heavenly father.
BROWN (CONT'D) A fine man has passed.
BROWN (CONT'D) Let us remember him with a drink.
14.
Both Hamilton and Brown hold up their tankards to drink.
Solomon, a bit reluctantly, does the same.
HAMILTON Cheers.
BROWN Another.
BROWN Our departed President deserves all the salutation we can imbibe.
BROWN Hamilton and Brown drink again, and Solomon does as well.
WE MAKE A HARD CUT to Solomon outside of the Pub, in an alley, with Brown and Hamilton in silhouette, back-lit by the street lights.
He is violently ill, hunched over and retching horribly.
HAMILTON That's all right Solomon.
HAMILTON No shame in it.
HAMILTON No shame at all.
15.
A23 INT.
GADSBY HOTEL - STAIRCASE A23
Hamilton and Brown help Solomon to lumber up the spiral staircase, passing the occasional bemused guest.
Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where a prone and reeling Solomon lays.
Hamilton sits on the bed.
As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton speaks sweetly.
HAMILTON I'm afraid that Brown and I haven't brought you much luck.
HAMILTON But rough waters bring smooth sailing.
HAMILTON Eventually they do.
SOLOMON ....So...so sorry...
HAMILTON Shhh.
HAMILTON We won't hear it.
HAMILTON We won't.
BROWN Let him sleep.
HAMILTON Hmm.
HAMILTON A good night's sleep.
HAMILTON And tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel as well and refreshed as though the earth were new again.
HAMILTON Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to Solomon for Brown's taste.
HAMILTON With more than a bit of
BROWN Hamilton!
BROWN Nothing more we can do for him.
HAMILTON Such is the pity.
HAMILTON Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks away from the bed.
HAMILTON He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A CANDLE.
HAMILTON The room goes dark with a blackness more than night.
HAMILTON Brown and Hamilton exit.
HAMILTON Solomon lays in the dark and moans.
HAMILTON His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE
16.
Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new circumstances.
He finds himself in a nearly lightless room about twelve feet square with walls of solid masonry.
There is a thick and well-locked door, a small window covered with iron bars and a shutter.
The only furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box stove.
As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and his LEGS IN IRONS.
At first Solomon is incredulous.
But that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.
He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them.
He does so with increasing desperation.
Solomon flails about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and beating against the masonry.
He grunts and screams without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.
After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires, slows, then finally he collapses.
And in this collapsed state he remains.
Solomon again awakens.
He hears sounds beyond the door...footsteps.
Eventually the door opens.
Enter JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.
As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into the otherwise near-black room.
The shine is painful to Solomon's eyes.
With no salutation whatsoever, Burch
BURCH Well, my boy, how yah feel now?
BURCH Solomon rises up as best he can.
BURCH With all the resolve he
can put together he states what he considers to be fact:
SOLOMON I am Solomon Northup.
SOLOMON I am a free man; a resident of Saratoga, New York.
SOLOMON The residence also of my wife and children who are equally free.
SOLOMON I have papers.
SOLOMON You have no right whatsoever to detain me--
BURCH Yah not any--
SOLOMON And I promise you - I promise - upon my liberation I will have satisfaction for this wrong.
BURCH Resolve this.
BURCH Produce your papers.
17.
With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his trousers.
He searches one, then the other, but they are empty.
He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his papers have been lifted.
Solomon's confidence shifts, but to resolve rather than fear.
Papers or none, he will not be easily cowed.
Still, Burch asserts:
BURCH (CONT'D) Yah no free man.
BURCH (CONT'D) And yah ain't from Saratoga.
BURCH (CONT'D) Yah from Georgia.
BURCH (CONT'D) A moment.
BURCH (CONT'D) Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man
yielding.
Burch says again:
BURCH (CONT'D) Yah ain't a free man.
BURCH (CONT'D) Yah nuthin' but a Georgia runaway.
BURCH (CONT'D) Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce.
BURCH (CONT'D) Solomon does not in any way.
BURCH (CONT'D) Both men exchange a long and daring stare.
BURCH (CONT'D) The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off.
BURCH (CONT'D) Burch, leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT
Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of "instruments:" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is about the size in circumference of two open hands, and bored with a small auger in numerous places.
He also carries a WHIP.
A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many strands.
The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the extremity of each.
Burch says again:
BURCH (CONT'D) Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.
BURCH (CONT'D) Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism.
BURCH (CONT'D) He will say nothing of the kind.
BURCH (CONT'D) As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men.
BURCH (CONT'D) He is pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his back.
BURCH (CONT'D) Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon down in a bent position.
BURCH (CONT'D) With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the back with the paddle.
BURCH (CONT'D) Burch strikes him wordlessly - no taunting, no sneering.
BURCH (CONT'D) Solomon screaming against each blow.
BURCH (CONT'D) His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND
This beating continues on and on and on until quite literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.
Dripping in sweat and panting:
18.
BURCH (CONT'D) Yah still insist yah a free man?
SOLOMON ...I...I insist...
SOLOMON Burch regrets hearing this.
SOLOMON Not from sympathy, but rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to beating Solomon.
SOLOMON Yet, as if returning to work, Burch returns to pummeling Solomon.
SOLOMON Burch punctuates the blows
BURCH Yah a slave.
BURCH Yah a Georgia slave!
BURCH Burch continues to strike, and strike...
BURCH This time until the paddle SNAPS IN HALF.
BURCH Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.
BURCH Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly, the flails cutting into Solomon's back.
BURCH Again, Burch's arm tires before Solomon "breaks."
BURCH (CONT'D) Are yah slave?
SOLOMON ...No...
SOLOMON Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...
OOZING WITH BLOOD.
Finally Burch can whip no more.
He pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough energy to take up his instruments and EXIT.
Radburn lingers for a moment.
He takes the irons off Solomon's legs.
Opens the window some.
As he makes these gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one wrought with poor sincerity::
RADBURN I seen a good many of the black kind just where yah're.
RADBURN Sick.
RADBURN Make me sick.
RADBURN Often times the situation was resolved, and I think; what was all the beatin' and abuse for?
RADBURN Things end as they should, and the violence was for naught.
RADBURN So why cause trouble when they ain't no cause for it?
RADBURN Be of a cooperative nature, and things don't need be particularly unpleasant.
Or, yah can carry on like yah been, and I fear yah won't live to see Sunday next.
With that thought, Radburn exits.
Solomon rests.
But to rest seems like giving in to defeat.
He begins pulling
19.
25 CONTINUED: (3) 25 on his chains.
But for all his struggling, the chain loosens none.
Solomon calls out:
SOLOMON Help me!
SOLOMON Someone help me!
SOLOMON If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond.
SOLOMON Solomon continues his plaintive cry for assistance.
Beginning with a TIGHT SHOT on the shuttered, barred window of Burch's dungeon - Solomon's cries barely eking beyond the space - THE CAMERA PULLS BACK from the building, onto the city until clearly visible is the Nation's capital.
It's icon's of freedom - the WHITE HOUSE, the CAPITOL BUILDING - fairly mocking Solomon's captivity.
Simultaneously, barren at the early hour and cluttered with litter and the remains of previous day's procession, the city is a bleak and forboding sight.
IT IS DAY NOW.
The door to the yard is thrown open.
The harsh white light floods all over Solomon.
20.
21.
It is a yard just beyond Burch's.
The yard is hemmed in by a brick wall.
In the yard are two men, and a boy.
The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age.
He is well educated.
JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years old.
He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.
Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who answers to the name of Randall.
Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED.
Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are all aware of the uselessness of modesty.
Radburn is present.
He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD WATER.
He throws water on the naked men.
RADBURN Go on.
RADBURN Warsh up.
RADBURN The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them.
RADBURN (CONT'D) The boy, too.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Get him clean.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Scrub now.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Git 'em clean.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Solomon scrubs harder.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Randall - clearly cold and uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon.
RANDALL Do you know when my Mama will come?
RADBURN Hush him up!
RADBURN Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to cry.
RANDALL Mama ..!
RANDALL Mama!
RANDALL Is she going to come?
RANDALL Doing all he can to spare the child from a certain
SOLOMON Quiet, please.
SOLOMON Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable.
RANDALL Mama!
Saying anything to keep the boy quiet:
SOLOMON Your mother will come, I swear she will, but you must be silent.
SOLOMON Please.
SOLOMON Be silent!
SOLOMON On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall goes silent.
SOLOMON Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws water on the soapy men.
22.
A32 INT.
BURCH'S DUNGEON - EVENING A32
Radburn brings food in to Solomon; a shriveled piece of meat and some water.
Just barely enough to sustain Solomon.
Radburn also has a SHIRT.
RADBURN That old thing of yours is just rags and tatters.
RADBURN Need something proper to wear.
RADBURN Solomon doesn't move for the clothing.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Go'won.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Put it on.
RADBURN (CONT'D) With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed.
RADBURN (CONT'D) He removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one Radburn brought him.
RADBURN (CONT'D) The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty.
Despite that, Radburn says:
RADBURN (CONT'D) There.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Tha's fine.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Tha's fine.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Got no gratitude?
SOLOMON ...Thank you...
RADBURN Yah keep bein' proper, yah'll see how things work out.
RADBURN Radburn starts to take the old shirt.
SOLOMON No!
SOLOMON It was from my wife.
RADBURN Rags and tatters.
RADBURN Rags and tatters.
RADBURN Taking the shirt, the "rags and tatters" as he calls them, Radburn exits, locking the door behind him.
RADBURN Solomon sits with the plate of food before him.
RADBURN He pushes the plate away rather than eat.
Sitting together out in the yard are Clemens Ray, John and Solomon.
Over time they have drawn trustworthy enough to speak with one another.
At the moment Solomon is still trying to apply reason to the situation.
Randall wanders about in the background.
As usual, he calls out for his "Mama."
By now, however, his calls should feel like little more than background noise.
SOLOMON This can't stand.
SOLOMON It is a crime.
SOLOMON I believe now someone lay in wait for me.
SOLOMON My drink was altered...
SOLOMON We are free men.
SOLOMON They have...they have no right to hold us.
SOLOMON Solomon waits for a response from the others.
SOLOMON They give none.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) We need a sympathetic ear.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) If we have an opportunity to explain our
CLEMENS Who in your estimation is that sympathetic ear?
SOLOMON The two men I journeyed with.
SOLOMON I'm certain they're making inquires at this very moment.
CLEMENS I would be just as certain they are counting the money paid for delivering you to this place.
SOLOMON They were not kidnappers.
SOLOMON They were artists.
SOLOMON Fellow performers.
CLEMENS You know that?
CLEMENS You know for certain who they were?
23.
The fact is, Solomon can't say for certain.
How I reckon the situation: whatever past we had...well, that's done now.
The reality to come is us being transported southward.
New Orleans if I were to venture.
After we arrive, we'll be put to market.
Beyond that...
Well, once in a slave state I suppose there's only one outcome.
JOHN No.
CLEMENS I don't say that to give you empty agitation, John...
JOHN For y'all.
JOHN For y'all they ain't nothin' but that!
JOHN But John was'n kidnapped.
JOHN John bein' hold as debt, tha's all.
JOHN Massa pay his debt, and John be redeemed--
CLEMENS Boy, our masters will not come for us.
CLEMENS John is nearly beside himself with panic.
JOHN Now John's...John's sorry for y'all, but tha's how it be.
JOHN Where y'all goin', yah goin' witout John.
JOHN Massa take care of me.
JOHN Massa take care.
RANDALL Mama!
RANDALL All three men turn and look.
RANDALL At the moment Randall doesn't call out emptily.
RANDALL At the door to the yard is Burch along with two women.
RANDALL One in her late twenties; ELIZA.
RANDALL She is "arrayed in silk, with rings upon her fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears."
RANDALL Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this point - lived well.
RANDALL This is reflected in her airs and her speech.
RANDALL The other is a little girl, light in skin color, of about seven or eight.
RANDALL This is EMILY, Randall's half sister.
RANDALL As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight, then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy.
RANDALL Clearly this is mother and child being reunited.
24.
As Burch locks the yard door, Eliza clutches Randall.
She is overcome with emotion.
ELIZA My darling.
ELIZA My sweet, sweet baby.
Later in the evening.
Solomon now shares his space with Eliza and her children.
As the children rest, Eliza drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon who lends a sympathetic ear.
Both slyly, and with a bit of aggrandizement:
ELIZA When I say I had my master's favor, you understand.
ELIZA Above even his own wife, I had it.
ELIZA Do you know that he built a house for me?
ELIZA Built it on the sole condition that I reside there with him.
ELIZA The added promise in time I would be emancipated.
ELIZA And for nine years he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life.
Displaying the finery she still wears:
ELIZA (CONT'D) Silks and jewels and even servants to wait upon us.
ELIZA (CONT'D) Such was our life, and the life of this beautiful girl I bore for him.
ELIZA (CONT'D) But Master Berry's daughter...she always looked at me with an unkind nature.
ELIZA (CONT'D) She hated Emily no matter she and Emily were flesh of flesh.
ELIZA (CONT'D) As Master Berry's health failed, she gained power in the household.
ELIZA (CONT'D) Eventually, I was brought to the city on the false pretense of our free papers being executed.
ELIZA (CONT'D) If I had known what waited; to be sent south?
ELIZA (CONT'D) I swear I would not have come here alive.
25.
Eliza turns to her children:
ELIZA (CONT'D) My poor, poor babies.
It's the deep of night, all are sleeping.
A KEY TURNS IN THE LOCK AND THE DOOR OPENS.
Burch enters with Radburn beside him.
Both carry LANTERNS with them.
Hardly giving Solomon and Eliza a moment to rouse themselves,
BURCH Come on.
BURCH Get yer blankets.
BURCH Get up.
Sensing that things will not end well:
ELIZA No, please don't...
BURCH I don't want to hear yer talk.
BURCH Get in the yard.
ELIZA Please...
RADBURN Ain't no need for all that.
RADBURN Putting hand to Randall's head.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Jus takin' a li'l trip, tha's all.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Don't want to frighten the chil'ren none over a li'l boat ride, do yah?
RADBURN (CONT'D) Eliza gives a shake of her head to the negative.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Alright then.
RADBURN (CONT'D) Git yerselves up.
We now have Solomon, Clemens, John, Eliza and the children.
They are being cuffed together.
As John is cuffed, he pulls back.
Scared.
He beings in
JOHN John's massa gunna pay his debt.
JOHN John's massa gunna come for him.
Not wanting to hear any of this talk, Burch strikes John several times in the head with a sap-like instrument.
Weakened, but again:
John's massa gunna-- Burch again strikes John until he's quiet.
Curiously, Emily and Randall don't even flinch.
Why would they?
They are quite used to seeing this kind of violence.
BURCH Not a word out of none a yah.
BURCH Not a word.
BURCH Burch and Radburn begin driving the shackled slaves from the yard.
The slaves are lead to a flat bed of the horse and carriage.
They are made to lay down side-by-side.
We stay with them as some sort of cloth is flung over them, obscuring and blacking out their view.
At that moment, the screen is BLACKENED and we hear the sound of the cart moving in haste.
Led by Burch, the group of slaves arrive to a dock.
They are taken quickly up a gangplank and onto the steamboat ORLEANS as the CAPTAIN, CREW and a MULATTO WOMAN WATCH, but do not interfere.
The slaves are hustled down one at a time into a dark, dank hold among barrels and boxes of freight...and RATS.
Burch comes around and "checks" the chains; makes sure they are all secure and locked.
Satisfied, he heads up out of the hold.
Radburn follows.
Alone in the dark in the hold, John cries, as does Eliza.
Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can, as if wishing bad things.
As if wanting to exact some measure of revenge.
But the greater insult is that Burch and Radburn, engaged in conversation, take no notice of Solomon whatsoever.
He is that insignificant to them.
That fact, that reality, makes Solomon boil with a rage he cannot express in words.
We are now in the engine room of the steamboat, pistons pumping, black oily cogs turning, the power and the rhythm are both aggressive and hypnotic.
A shovel comes into view, feeding the furnace.
The steamboat is en route between Washington and Norfolk.
We tilt up from the violent water foam to the powering paddles of the boat.
29.
Down in the hold the slaves eat, pray.
The MULATTO WOMAN moves among them, catching ELIZA's eye.
Cheer up and don't be so cast down.
Clemens Ray and Solomon watch as the Mulatto Woman returns to top deck, the trapdoor locked firmly behind her.
Clemens Ray turns to Solomon with a deadpan stern expression.
CLEMENS RAY If you want to survive, do and say as little as possible.
CLEMENS RAY Tell no one who you really are and tell no one that you can read and write.
Clemens Ray turns away from Solomon, eyes lost into the distance.
Unless you want to be a dead nigger.
Solomon's face is one of a confused despair.
We see a flat overhead view of the port of Norfolk.
Sardines are laid out to dry in rows, glittering in the day's sun as if like silver pennies.
A chain of slaves enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked vessel.
MORE SLAVES - about 15 in all, of various genders and ages - are brought on board.
Chief among them is ROBERT who fights viciously with his captors.
"With all haste" is shoved down into the hold.
Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to, Burch and Radburn depart.
They do so without a word spoken to Solomon or the others.
With this new and sizable batch of slaves on board, the crew again CASTS OFF, and the Orleans makes its way again.
Solomon is back cleaning in the galley.
As he cleans, he again watches Robert prep food.
Robert's skill with a knife is not lost on Solomon.
The hold is packed tighter now.
Muzzle covering his face, Robert is shackled with his hands tied behind his back.
Solomon and Clemens Ray look on.
A sailor descends the staircase and takes off Robert's muzzle, shooting him a forbidding look.
He leaves.
Solomon, Clemens Ray and Robert, now in mid-conversation.
ROBERT I say we fight.
ROBERT Robert delivers this in a hushed voice.
SOLOMON The crew is fairly small.
SOLOMON If it were well planned, I believe they could be strong armed.
CLEMENS RAY Three can't stand against a whole crew.
CLEMENS RAY The rest here are niggers, born and bred slaves.
CLEMENS RAY Niggers ain't got the stomach for a fight, not a damn one.
ROBERT All I know, we get where we travelling we'll wish we'd died trying.
CLEMENS RAY Survival is not about certain death, it is about keeping your head down.
CLEMENS RAY Solomon looks at Clemens Ray, agitated -- his voice now raised above the previous whispers.
CLEMENS RAY Grits his teeth.
SOLOMON Days ago I was with my family, in my home.
SOLOMON Now you tell me all is lost.
SOLOMON "Tell no one who I really am" if I want to survive.
SOLOMON I don't want to survive, I want to live.
The steamboat paddles pound the water, filling the whole frame.
The vessel ploughs on south.
32.
The slaves are asleep.
A Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza.
He bends down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her face.
Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene.
From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt the Sailor.
The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back at him.
Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the hold.
As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand between Eliza and the Sailor.
Stretching out a firm hand to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says "No you don't."
Clemens Ray is awake now, watching.
There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor and Robert, an impasse.
We focus on the Sailor's face.
Slowly, a greasy smile erupts upon it.
Back now to Robert's face, a look of incomprehension.
Robert looks down.
We follow his gaze to the knife that has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs.
The sailor withdraws the bloody blade.
A wide shot of the two men.
Robert collapses to the floor like a sack of potatoes.
Clemens Ray and Solomon react.
Complete horror.
33.
We are back up on the deck of the ship.
SOLOMON AND CLEMENS RAY dump ROBERT's body over the side of the ship.
Solomon watches as the body churns for a moment in the wake of the vessel...
then sinks beneath the water.
Clemens Ray, with no sentimentality:
CLEMENS RAY Better off.
CLEMENS RAY Better than us.
Solomon's POV from the back of the steamship of Robert's corpse slipping gracefully into the water.
A white male, fairly smart, with broad shoulders, stands
RAY Clemens...!
RAY Clemens Ray!
RAY We are in the port of New Orleans, one of the busiest in the young nation.
RAY On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods are loaded and unloaded from a various ships.
RAY It's a bit of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to a holding pen.
RAY Solomon, and all the slaves are overwhelmed by all that is happening around them.
RAY Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the Orleans.
RAY They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Ray's master - and DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray.
RAY They both look like they mean business.
RAY The moment the gangplank is laid, Ray yells for Clemens.
RAY Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight.
RAY He is, uncharacteristically beside himself.
RAY Ironically, his master now represents "freedom."
34.
CLEMENS ...My master...
CLEMENS Master Ray, sir!
CLEMENS Master Ray!
CLEMENS Clemens pulls on his chain.
CLEMENS As he does so, Several other slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master, like dominos.
RAY Who is in charge of this vessel?
CAPTAIN I am the Captain.
RAY I am Mr. Jonus Ray.
RAY My solicitor has documentation verifying that the Negro named Clemens Ray is my property.
As he reads PAPERS handed to him by Davis:
CAPTAIN I know nothing of--
RAY You are ordered by court to return that property immediately, or face charges of thievery.
CAPTAIN My duty is to transport goods.
CAPTAIN I am not responsible for their origin.
RAY Remove these contraptions!
To his mate:
CAPTAIN Free him!
CAPTAIN Biddee does as ordered.
CAPTAIN Once free, Clemens hugs and sobs over his master as would a lost and then found child.
RAY It's all well, now, Clemens.
RAY You will return home with me.
RAY Consider this notice and warning.
35.
Ray, Davis and Clemens head away.
Solomon seems both desperate and hopeful of some aid from Clemens and Ray.
But there is none forthcoming.
Ray and Clemens continue on - Clemens not so much as even looking back in Solomon's direction.
Solomon stands and watches as they fade into the environs and are gone from sight.
Hours later.
The slaves sit off on one side of the dock, baking in the sun, awaiting their fate.
THEOPHILUS FREEMAN - a tall, thin-faced man with light complexion and a little bent - moves along the deck calling out names from a list.
The slaves STAND as they are called.
FREEMAN Oren.
FREEMAN John.
FREEMAN Lethe.
FREEMAN Eliza.
FREEMAN Randall.
FREEMAN Emily.
FREEMAN Platt...
FREEMAN Platt!
FREEMAN Solomon does not respond.
FREEMAN Freeman looks around.
FREEMAN He spots Solomon.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Captain, who shipped that nigger?
CAPTAIN Burch.
CAPTAIN Freeman steps to Solomon.
CAPTAIN He gives him a looking over.
FREEMAN Stand up.
FREEMAN Solomon does as told.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) You fit the description given.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Why didn't you answer when called?
SOLOMON My name is not Platt.
SOLOMON My name is-- Freeman strikes Solomon hard across the face.
FREEMAN Your name is Platt, and I will teach you your name so that you don't forget.
FREEMAN Shackle my niggers.
FREEMAN Get them to my cart.
36.
Solomon is carted off along with the rest of "Burch's stock:" Eliza and her children, John and Solomon.
As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart, it opens up to the frenzic, busy port.
For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery.
These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back in Saratoga.
These are humans held in strict bondage - herded like cattle, chained together as if in a "chain gang."
Slaves are evident not merely by the color of their skin.
The residue and accessories of slavery are everywhere.
Blacks almost universally display scars -
UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs.
Blacks are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked.
Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits.
One slave is attacked by a dog and the slave owner.
The dog pulls and tears at the slave's clothes.
THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A
NORM.
They should be a reminder that not only are people being oppressed, but that there is an entire system of oppression in place.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER "Burch's stock:" arrive at Freeman's slave pen.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER They are led in by Freeman and his house slave CAPE - a mulatto.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER The yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch's.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER Including Burch's group there are about 30 SLAVES in the pen.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but downtrodden and despondent faces.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER Three men sit next to each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this new batch of arrivals.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER One attempts to speak, but all that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER The slaves are in various states of undress, men and women alike.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER They clean themselves, scrubbing with soap and water.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER Women wash their hair.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER Men shave, skin is oiled.
FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER Freeman walks among them, inspecting them as they primp themselves.
The slaves are given new clothes by Cape.
The men are given hat, coat, shirt, pants and shoes.
The women
37.
57 CONTINUED: 57 frocks of calico and handkerchiefs to bind about their heads.
It's an odd, ironic scene.
The slaves are in a large and fairly ornate room within Freeman's house.
CAPE PLAYS A PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a good impression.
Sometimes his patience gets the better of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the slaves.
The business has the air of an etiquette class, though what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into being more "sellable."
He works with them in groups of five or so.
FREEMAN Tallest to smallest, understand?
FREEMAN Are you taller than her?
FREEMAN Then you'd go before her.
FREEMAN Do it.
FREEMAN Move.
FREEMAN Keep your heads up.
FREEMAN A sense of direction; that's how you look smart.
FREEMAN None of those saucer eyes.
FREEMAN Rid yourself of that smile.
FREEMAN Look like a goddamn grinnin' monkey.
FREEMAN Put the least thought in your head.
FREEMAN C'mon, now.
FREEMAN Think of somethin'.
Weary of Cape's playing, Solomon moves to Cape.
He asks:
SOLOMON Can you play a reel?
Nah.
I don't know no reel.
SOLOMON If I may...?
Cape looks to Freeman:
FREEMAN He sick of your caterwaulin'.
FREEMAN Let him play, boy.
FREEMAN Let's see what he can do.
FREEMAN Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon.
FREEMAN Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play.
FREEMAN His fingers stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up.
FREEMAN But as he warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful.
38.
THE SLAVES ALL CLAP ALONG.
SOME DANCE ALONG.
All admire his work.
Freeman chief among them.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Keep on.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Keep on.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Solomon continues to play.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) A damn sight better than you, Cape.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) A damn sight better.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Cape looks bitter as Solomon plays on.
We come in on an odd sort of sight; A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY.
CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman's lot - the room all gussied up with flowers.
Freeman moves among them, displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel.
Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - "look smart" as he previously admonished them.
They are made to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what skills they possess.
The Customers routinely make the slaves open their mouths and show their teeth.
At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the side, stripped and inspected more minutely.
One of them, John, is stripped and inspected.
Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle.
A buyer - WILLIAM FORD; a man of middle age, and an attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list he's drawn up and asks of Freeman:
FORD What is the price for the ones Platt and Eliza?
FREEMAN A thousand for Platt; he is a nigger of talent.
FREEMAN Seven hundred for Eliza.
FREEMAN My fairest price.
FORD You will accept a note?
FREEMAN As always, from you, Mr. Ford.
FREEMAN Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be
separated from her family.
She begs of Ford:
39.
ELIZA Please, sir...
ELIZA Please don't divide my family.
ELIZA Don't take me unless you take my children as well.
FREEMAN Eliza, quiet!
ELIZA You will have the most faithful slave in me, sir.
ELIZA The most faithful slave that has ever lived, but I beg that you do not separate us.
ELIZA A BUYER interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall-
BUYER Your price for the child?
FREEMAN You see how fit the boy is.
FREEMAN Like ripe fruit.
FREEMAN He will grow into a fine beast.
FREEMAN Randall is made to run, and jump by FREEMAN - exhibiting his activity and his condition.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Six hundred, and that's fair and final.
BUYER Done.
BUYER He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet, counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the already extended hand of Freeman.
BUYER Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly touches him.
BUYER He now tries to buy EMILY to console her.
FORD How much for the little girl?
FORD You have no need for her.
FORD One so young will bring you no profit.
FREEMAN I will not sell the girl.
FREEMAN There's heaps 'n piles of money to be made off her.
FREEMAN She is a beauty.
FREEMAN One of the regular bloods.
FREEMAN None of your thick-lipped, bullet headed, cotton picking niggers.
FORD Her child, man.
FORD For God's sake, are you not sentimental in the least?
FREEMAN My sentimentality stretches the length of a coin.
FREEMAN Do you want the lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on them all?
FORD I will take the ones Platt and Eliza.
FORD Eliza grips her children tight.
ELIZA I will not go without my children.
ELIZA You will not take them from me.
40.
As if to prove her wrong, Freeman puts a foot to Eliza and harshly kicks her away from Emily.
ELIZA (CONT'D) Please, don't.
ELIZA (CONT'D) No!
Freeman, to Cape:
FREEMAN Take her out of here.
FREEMAN Cape DROPS HIS FIDDLE, begins to pull Eliza away toward the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do not abate.
FREEMAN IT IS CLEARLY UNSETTLING TO THE OTHER BUYERS.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Keep her quiet.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Cape tries to muzzle her with his hand, but Eliza continues to scream for her children as Emily does for her mother.
EMILY Mama...
EMILY Mama!
Play something!
Get the fiddle and play.
As ordered, Solomon takes up Cape's fiddle and begins to play lightly.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Play!
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Solomon plays harder and more loudly.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Still, it is barely enough to drown out Eliza's cries.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Freeman gets the other slaves to clap along with Solomon's playing.
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring to be strong-
EMILY Don't cry, Mama.
EMILY I will be a good girl.
EMILY Don't cry.
EMILY I will keep my head up and I will look smart.
EMILY I will always look smart.
FREEMAN Make merry, all of you!
FREEMAN Goddamn it, Cape!
FREEMAN Keep her quiet or it's your damned hide I will take it out of!
FREEMAN Cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza's mouth.
FREEMAN Clamping both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room by the head.
FREEMAN IT IS AN UGLY, UGLY SCENE.
Driven in a horse drawn wagon by Ford are Solomon and Eliza.
Eliza is sullen to say the least.
With the loss of her two children she has dropped into a depression she will not be able to pull out of.
41.
They arrive to the FORD PLANTATION.
The main house of the plantation - the GREAT HOUSE as they are commonly called - is sizable.
Two stories high with a piazza in front.
In the rear are also a log kitchen, poultry house, corncribs and several slave cabins.
The plantation is described as "a green spot in the wilderness."
With the arrival of Master Ford there is a flurry of activity - the "excitement" of a new delivery.
MR.
CHAPIN, a white overseer, instructs a slave named SAM.
CHAPIN Sam, call to the Mistress.
SAM Mistress!
SAM Mistress, they arrivn'.
SAM MISTRESS FORD EXITS the house - along with her attending slave, RACHEL, who is a cook AS WELL AS SAM'S WIFE - and travels to her husband, kisses him, then laughingly
MRS. FORD Did you bring all those niggers?
MRS. FORD Two of them?
MRS. FORD You got two?
FORD Make me something to eat, dear.
FORD The day has taken it from me.
MRS. FORD Let me get a look at them...
FORD Mr. Chapin--
This one's cryin'.
Why is this one cryin'?
FORD Separated from her children.
MRS. FORD Oh, dear.
FORD It couldn't be helped.
MRS. FORD Poor, poor woman.
FORD Mr. Chapin, tomorrow you will take these two up to the mill and start them workin'.
FORD For now make them
42.
FORD (CONT'D) adequate; fix them a meal, and have them rest themselves.
CHAPIN Yes, sir.
CHAPIN C'mon, now.
CHAPIN C'mon.
CHAPIN Don't dawdle.
Something to eat and some rest; your children will soon enough be forgotten.
A61A A61A
EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY John Tibeats, stands before the slaves.
EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY Chapin hovers to one side.
TIBEATS My name is John Tibeats, William Ford's chief carpenter.
TIBEATS You will refer to me as Master.
Tibeats nods in Chapin's direction:
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Mister Chapin is the overseer on this plantation.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) He is responsible for all of Ford's property.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) You too will refer to him as Master.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) This plantation covers many hundreds of acres, and you will traverse the Texas road between the forest site and the sawmill in double time.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Any clever nigger on that path that gets a little lightfooted, I will remind him that on one side men and bloodhounds patrol the border and on the other the bayou provides a hard living, with alligators and little to eat or drink that won't kill you.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) No slave has escaped here with his life.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) You're here to work niggers, so let's commence.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Tibeats begins to sing the song "Run Nigger, Run" mockingly.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) We cut to Solomon chopping logs and into the montage of the slaves doing manual labor and arriving back to the sawmill.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Lyrics for "Run Nigger, Run"
A61A CONTINUED: A61A Oh run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Nigger run nigger flew Nigger tore his shirt in two Run run the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Nigger run, run so fast Stoved his head in a hornets nest Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Nigger run through the field Black slick coal and barley heel Run nigger run the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Some folks say a nigger won't steal I caught three in my corn field One has a bushel?
And one has a peck One had a rope and it was hung around his neck Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Oh nigger run and nigger flew Why in the devil can't a white man chew Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Hey Mr. Pattyroller don't catch me Catch that nigger behind that tree Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you?
Run nigger run well you better get away Nigger run, run so fast Stoved his head in a hornets nest Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away
We are in a wooded area.
There is A GANG OF SLAVES chopping trees into timber.
It is hard, laborious work made no more easy by the sweltering heat.
Solomon is among them as well as Sam.
The slaves now load the timber onto a horse drawn wagon.
Again, hard work done under the ever present sun.
As Sam drives the wagon, the other slaves trudge along side by foot.
We should get the sense the travel is long and tedious.
It is a sizable work area on the edge of Indian Creek.
There is much work being done, the slaves primarily employed in piling the timber and chopping it into lumber.
As before, there is little doubt about the rigors of the job at hand.
Working as a carpenter at the work area is JOHN TIBEATS.
There are also various CUSTOMERS who move about placing orders.
It's Sunday morning.
All of Ford's slaves are dressed with their "finest" clothes - brightly colored and as free as possible of defect.
The slaves are gathered on
43.
65 CONTINUED: 65 the lawn just beyond the piazza.
Mistress Ford is present as well.
As the slaves listen, Ford reads to them Scripture.
His tone is of a man trying to preach by way of compassion.
FORD "But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
FORD God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
FORD And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
FORD Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
FORD Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
FORD This is the first and great commandment.
FORD And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
FORD On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."
FORD Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED
We should be able to see in Mistress Ford's eyes that Eliza's constant crying is unsettling.
44.
The slaves have broken for lunch.
They snack on smoked meat and drink water from gourds.
As they lunch Solomon reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves.
SOLOMON But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
SOLOMON For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth?
SOLOMON Is not he that sitteth at meat?
SOLOMON But I am among you as he that serveth.
SOLOMON A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over.
SOLOMON He grabs the Bible.
WINSLOW From where did you thieve this?
SAM Suh, the book is my property.
SAM The White Customer has no interest in Sam's answer.
SAM With flailing hands he STARTS BEATING ON SAM.
SAM Solomon tries to stop him.
SAM That only makes the situation worse, Solomon now the target of the man's ire.
WINSLOW Take your hands from me!
WINSLOW Ford comes running over.
FORD What is the commotion?
WINSLOW Your niggers are either brazen or rebellious.
WINSLOW This one was readin' Scripture, and this one claims it to be his.
FORD It is.
FORD A gift from his Mistress.
WINSLOW You condone this?
FORD I encourage it.
FORD As a Christian I can do no less.
45.
WINSLOW You can do no worse, Ford.
WINSLOW A slave that reads is dangerous.
Winslow moves off.
He yells back at Ford:
And the man who would allow a slave to read is unfit to own niggers!
Handing the Bible back to Sam, very matter of factly:
FORD Pay him no mind.
FORD The word of God applies to all.
FORD In that you may take comfort.
Sam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to Ford's WORK AREA.
Slaves trudge alongside, same as it ever was.
Only...it's not quite the same.
Sam brings the wagon to a halt.
He, and the slaves look up the road ahead of them.
Standing in the middle of the road is a group of CHICKASAWS INDIANS.
They are in their "usual" dress of buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic colors, buttoned from belt to chin.
They have with them DOGS and HORSES.
They carry with them the carcass of a deer.
The two groups stare at each other for a long moment.
The groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled.
They "break bread" - actually they work on the carcass of the deer which is now roasting over a large fire.
As well the group share a smoke on a pipe.
One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an "INDIAN FIDDLE."
The Chickasaws perform a customary dance; trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a guttural, sing-song noise.
The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon particularly taken by the music...if not entirely enthralled by it.
46.
After a bit, Solomon rights himself and heads from the group.
Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the river.
Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO DEFECATE.
As he does, he stares out toward the flowing waters of Indian Creek.
After a few moments, as though a thought far greater than relieving himself has come to him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants.
Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were a man possessed.
FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as Tibeats listens.
FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY Solomon is drawing in the dirt, making rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself.
SOLOMON The creek is plenty deep enough to sail, even with a boat full of load.
SOLOMON The distance from the WORK AREA to the point on the latter bayou is several miles by water fewer than land.
SOLOMON It occurs to me that the expense of the transportation would be materially
TIBEATS "Materially diminished?"
SOLOMON If we use the waterway.
TIBEATS It's a scheme.
TIBEATS Plenty of engineers have schemed similarly.
TIBEATS The passes are too tight.
SOLOMON I reckon them at more than twelve feet at their most narrow.
SOLOMON Wide enough for a tub to traverse.
SOLOMON A team of niggers can clear it out.
TIBEATS And you know what of transport and terra formin'?
47.
SOLOMON I labored repairing the Champlain canal, on the section over which William Van Nortwick was superintendent.
SOLOMON With my earnings I hired several efficient hands to assist me, and I entered into contracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber from Lake Champlain to Troy.
I'll admit to being impressed even if you won't.
Collect a gang, see what good you can do.
WE HAVE A SERIES OF SCENES in which we see Solomon and a TEAM OF BLACKS working on the creek: CHOPPING TREES ALONG THE BANKS, widening out the shore...
It's all just a trial for now.
The work is diligent, but it is basic to this point.
Still, under Solomon's direction, the slaves go at it like they've got something to prove.
And rightly they do.
Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with which he will transport the timber.
Once this is constructed, HE PERSONALLY "SAILS" THEM UP
Ford and a group of slaves wait along the river banks just beyond the WORK AREA.
All are expectant in their manner.
A long moment passes with no sign of Solomon.
Then, from up river, we see Solomon's raft of lumber winding its way.
SLAVES CHEER, and Ford literally applauds the effort.
Tibeats looks pissed.
He has just been shown up after all.
As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon with a fiddle.
Not as grand as the one he previously owned in New York, but a fine instrument none the less.
It is a gift of thanks for his hard work.
Solomon's gratitude is easily expressed.
48.
SOLOMON My great thanks, Master Ford.
FORD My thanks to you, and it is the least of it.
FORD My hope is that it brings us both much joy over the years.
FORD Following the statement, Solomon's not sure how to react.
FORD He remains grateful, but the thought of "over the years" is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now finds himself.
The slaves eat.
All tired from a days work they conduct themselves in silence.
All except for Eliza who, SLIPPING INTO PERMANENT DEPRESSION, as always weeps.
The sound of her sobbing edging him up - particularly after Master Ford's "over the years" observation.
Solomon
SOLOMON Eliza.
SOLOMON Eliza, stop!
SOLOMON Solomon goes to her, grabs Eliza.
SOLOMON She does not stop.
SOLOMON As if to force the misery from her, Solomon SHAKES ELIZA
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Stop it!
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Stop!
ELIZA It's all I have to keeps my loss present.
SOLOMON You let yourself be overcome by sorrow.
SOLOMON You will drown in it.
ELIZA Have you stopped crying for your children?
ELIZA You make no sounds, but will you ever let them go in your heart?
SOLOMON ...They are as my flesh...
49.
ELIZA Then who is distressed?
ELIZA Do I upset the Mistress and the Master?
ELIZA Do you care less for my loss than their well being?
SOLOMON Master Ford is a decent man.
ELIZA He is a slaver.
SOLOMON Under the circumstances--
ELIZA Under the circumstances he is a slaver!
ELIZA Christian only in his proclamations.
ELIZA Separated me from my precious babies for lack of a few dollars.
ELIZA But you truckle at
SOLOMON No...
ELIZA You luxuriate in his favor.
SOLOMON I survive.
SOLOMON I will not fall into despair.
SOLOMON Woeful and crushed; melancholy is the yolk I see most.
SOLOMON I will offer up my talents to Master Ford.
SOLOMON I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune.
ELIZA Ford is your opportunity.
ELIZA Do you think he does not know that you are more than you suggest?
ELIZA But he does nothing for you.
ELIZA Nothing.
ELIZA You are no better than prized livestock.
ELIZA Call for him.
ELIZA Call, tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns you...Solomon.
ELIZA Eliza uses Solomon's name quite pointedly as if to underscore his true self.
ELIZA Solomon get her meaning.
ELIZA Yet
he says nothing.
Again, pointedly:
ELIZA (CONT'D) So, you've settled into your role as Platt, then?
My back is thick with scars from
50.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) protesting my freedom.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Do not
ELIZA I accuse you of nothing.
ELIZA I cannot accuse.
ELIZA I too have done so many, many dishonorable things to survive.
ELIZA And for all of them I have ended up here...
ELIZA No better than if I had stood up for myself.
ELIZA Father, Lord and Savior forgive me...
ELIZA Forgive me.
ELIZA Oh, Solomon, let me weep for my children.
At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
It's Sunday.
The slaves are again gathered in the rose garden near the front of the house to hear the word of the Lord as read by Master Ford.
FORD And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
FORD The phrase seems to trigger Eliza's tears.
FORD She begins to sob uncontrollably.
FORD Mrs. Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper-
MRS. FORD I cannot have that kind of depression about.
MRS. FORD Solomon, pretending not to have heard, slowly turns to Eliza with worry.
MRS. FORD Ford continues to preach over Eliza's keening.
FORD But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
FORD Woe unto
FORD (CONT'D) the world because of offences!
FORD (CONT'D) For it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
51.
Seasons have passed.
It is winter now, and very grey out along the bayou.
Ford and Tibeats - who we have seen working around the WORK AREA - stand with Solomon, Tibeats giving Solomon an inspection.
Ford carries much lament.
TIBEATS Raise yer shirt.
TIBEATS Solomon does as instructed.
TIBEATS Tibeats looks at Solomon's back, at the scars from lashings he bears.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Troublesome.
FORD He's a good carpenter and quick- witted.
TIBEATS I am familiar with his cleverness.
FORD You won't find a nigger more humble.
TIBEATS Ain't found a nigger yet I cain't humble.
TIBEATS Tibeats heads off.
TIBEATS Solomon, highly curious over the preceding.
SOLOMON Sir, have I done something wrong?
FORD Not your concern, Platt.
FORD I say with much...shame I have compiled debts.
FORD I have long preached austerity, but find myself hypocritical in that regard.
FORD You'll be in the ownership of Mr.
FORD Tibeats.
FORD You are his now.
FORD Serve him as you'd serve me.
SOLOMON Sir.
FORD And your faithfulness will not be forgotten.
52.
SOLOMON Yes, sir.
FORD Pride and want have been my sin.
FORD Loss of you is but one of my punishments.
We see Solomon working as a carpenter, helping to erect a Weaving House that stands off to the side of the plantation's Great House.
At the moment Solomon is nailing on siding.
Tibeats arrives and is immediately dissatisfied with the work.
TIBEATS Make them boards flush.
SOLOMON They are, sir.
TIBEATS They is no such thing.
TIBEATS Solomon runs his hands over the boards.
SOLOMON As smooth to the touch as a yearling's coat.
TIBEATS Callin' me a liar, boy?
SOLOMON Only a matter of perspective, sir.
SOLOMON From where you stand you may see differently.
SOLOMON But the hands are not mistaken.
SOLOMON I ask only that you employ all your senses before rendering judgement.
SOLOMON What's Tibeats to do when faced with fact?
SOLOMON All he can do is spew invectives.
TIBEATS You are a brute.
TIBEATS You are a dog, and no better for followin' instruction.
SOLOMON I'll do as ordered, sir.
53.
TIBEATS Then you'll be up at daybreak.
TIBEATS You will procure a keg of nails from Chapin and commence puttin' on clapboards.
TIBEATS Tibeats wheels away.
TIBEATS Solomon goes back to his work.
TIBEATS After a few moments Solomon notices a bit of commotion in the drive of the great house.
TIBEATS It involves an inconsolable Eliza who is being herded by Sam onto a cart DRIVEN BY A WHITE MAN.
TIBEATS Mistress Ford and Rachel watch.
TIBEATS Solomon can only watch as the last connection to his days as a free man is driven away to a location unknown.
It is day break.
As ordered, Solomon is up and working.
Chapin is rolling a keg of nails off a handcart for Solomon.
CHAPIN If Tibeats prefers a different size, I will endeavor to furnish them, but you may use those until further directed.
SOLOMON Yes, sir.
As the day gets on to mid-morning, the sun already baking in the sky, Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon.
Even before arriving to Solomon his mien is one of belligerence; out of sorts and something less than sober.
TIBEATS I thought I told yah ta commence ta puttin' on clapboards this morn'.
54.
SOLOMON Yes, master.
SOLOMON I am about it.
SOLOMON I have begun on the other side of the house.
SOLOMON Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon's work.
SOLOMON He is picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault.
TIBEATS Didn't I tell yah last night to get a keg of nails of Chapin?
SOLOMON And so I did; and Chapin said he would get another size for you, if you wanted them when he came back from the field.
SOLOMON Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it.
SOLOMON Moving toward Solomon "with a great passion:"
TIBEATS Goddamn yah!
TIBEATS I thought yah knowed somethin'!
TIBEATS Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in no mood for Tibeats.
SOLOMON I did as instructed.
SOLOMON If there's something wrong, then its wrong with your instructions.
TIBEATS Yah black bastard!
TIBEATS Yah goddman black bastard!
TIBEATS In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza to fetch a whip.
TIBEATS Solomon looks around.
TIBEATS He is alone other than Rachel and Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses, runs out to the field to fetch Chapin.
TIBEATS Solomon's instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats marches back whip in hand.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Strip yer clothes!
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Solomon does no such thing.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Strip!
SOLOMON I will not.
SOLOMON With "concentrated vengeance," Tibeats springs for Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and
55.
84 CONTINUED: (2) 84 raising the whip with the other.
Before he can strike the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar of his coat and pulls him in close.
Reaching down, Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back with the other hand.
Tibeats tumbles to the ground.
A violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the handle again and again and again.
TIBEATS Yew will not live ta see another day, nigger!
TIBEATS This is yer last, I swear it!
TIBEATS Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats.
TIBEATS Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats's wriggling form.
TIBEATS The stiff stock of the whip wraps around Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches.
TIBEATS Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and
then pleas for mercy:
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Murder!
TIBEATS (CONT'D) It's murder!
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Lord, God, help me.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) God be merciful!
TIBEATS (CONT'D) And then suddenly, Tibeats shrieks-
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Papa I'm sorry!
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Chapin comes RIDING IN FROM THE FIELD fast and hard.
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the ground.
CHAPIN What is the matter?
CHAPIN Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on
SOLOMON Master Tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me.
CHAPIN What's the matter with the nails?
CHAPIN With a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, Tibeats says, as if being exposed-
TIBEATS They're...they're too large.
CHAPIN I am overseer here.
CHAPIN I told Platt to use them, and
56.
CHAPIN (CONT'D) I shall furnish such nails as I please.
CHAPIN (CONT'D) Do you understand that, Mr. Tibeats?
CHAPIN (CONT'D) Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the shaking of his fist.
TIBEATS This ain't done by half.
TIBEATS I will have flesh, and I will have all of it.
TIBEATS Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE.
TIBEATS Chapin follows.
TIBEATS A long moment, Solomon stands alone.
TIBEATS He looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee.
TIBEATS Anxiety mounts on his features.
TIBEATS A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house.
TIBEATS He saddles his horse and rides off to beat the devil.
TIBEATS Or, worse, to fetch him.
TIBEATS Chapin comes running back out of the house.
TIBEATS He is visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest.
TIBEATS Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off an air of impending trouble.
CHAPIN Do not stir.
CHAPIN Do not attempt to leave the plantation on any account whatever.
CHAPIN But if you run there is no protecting you.
CHAPIN If you run, Platt, there is no protecting you.
CHAPIN Rachel...!
CHAPIN Chapin runs off to join Rachel.
CHAPIN The two converse at a distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log kitchen.
CHAPIN Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is to come.
CHAPIN AND WE WAIT WITH HIM.
CHAPIN And we wait, and we continue to wait...
CHAPIN Moment by moment, the dread of the unexpected mounts.
CHAPIN Solomon's eyes begin to well.
CHAPIN He has beaten a white man, and he knows that death awaits him.
THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it.
57.
Chapin has now returned to the piazza.
He stands and watches, but does not move to Solomon.
Solomon waits, and waits...
WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and louder in the manner of rolling thunder.
It's Tibeats.
He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK.
They carry with them large whips and a coil of rope.
TIBEATS Tha's the one.
TIBEATS Tha's him.
TIBEATS Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence.
TIBEATS Solomon tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same manner.
TIBEATS In the meantime the other two have slipped a cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back and tying it firmly.
TIBEATS Solomon is then dragged toward a peach tree.
TIBEATS A lynching is in store.
TIBEATS The naked horror of it intensely palpable.
TIBEATS Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone.
TIBEATS Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks.
TIBEATS He is on the verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution, he begins to struggle and fight.
TIBEATS A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over the branch of the tree.
TIBEATS The trio begin to hoist Solomon.
TIBEATS He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the life is choked from him.
TIBEATS With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber "Holster" pistols with 9" barrels.
TIBEATS Chapin moves with determination toward the lynch mob.
TIBEATS He is sharp and matter of fact.
TIBEATS With the guns in hand, he really doesn't need to be much more demonstrative.
CHAPIN Gentlemen...
CHAPIN Whoever moves that nigger another foot from where he stands is a dead man.
CHAPIN I am overseer of this plantation seven years, and in the absence of William Ford, my duty is to protect his interests.
CHAPIN Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars.
CHAPIN If you hang him, he loses his debt.
CHAPIN Until that is canceled you have no claim to his life.
Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook:
58.
CHAPIN (CONT'D) As for you two, if you have any regard for your own safety...I say, begone!
CHAPIN (CONT'D) Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice.
CHAPIN (CONT'D) The pistols Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear.
CHAPIN (CONT'D) Without further word, they mount their horses and ride away.
CHAPIN (CONT'D) Tibeats remains, and his anger with him.
TIBEATS Yah got no cause.
TIBEATS Platt is mine, and mine ta do with as I please.
TIBEATS Yah touch my property, I will 'ave yah strung up as well.
TIBEATS Tibeats mounts up and departs.
TIBEATS There is a surreal moment as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon.
TIBEATS He chooses to do nothing.
TIBEATS Solomon is left dangling by the neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the
CHAPIN Sam!
CHAPIN Get the mule.
CHAPIN You must ride to Master Ford.
CHAPIN Tell him to come here at once without a single moment's delay.
CHAPIN Tell him they are trying to murder Platt.
CHAPIN Hurry, boy.
CHAPIN Bring him back if you must kill the mule to do so!
SAM Yes, suh!
SAM Sam mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much speed.
HOURS HAVE PASSED.
The sun is now at its apex.
The sight and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was left.
The scene is both tranquil and horrific.
Life on the plantation continues.
The OTHER SLAVES work in the field.
CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard.
It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this time and space.
59.
Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his hands.
Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and better assistance.
And yet, he does nothing to alleviate Solomon's suffering.
He heeds Tibeats words, and as though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a property dispute, he offers no further aid.
Solomon's head lolls to one side.
He looks toward the sun.
The bright light flares off the leaves and branches of the tree from which Solomon hangs.
The glare in Solomon's eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he cannot help but look upward.
As he does, his eyes flutter between life and lifelessness...
Solomon continues to hang.
By now he is drenched in sweat, and nearly delirious with dehydration.
His lips dry and parched.
He may not die from hanging, but he may very well expire before the day is over.
Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for him.
She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the water which clings to his lips.
Rachel then retreats, and leaves Solomon to hang.
The sun is just now arching for the horizon.
Solomon remains, as though his torture will not end.
Ford, trailed by Sam, finally comes riding up.
He dismounts, and moves swiftly over to Solomon.
With great heartache:
FORD Platt...
FORD My poor Platt.
FORD Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose.
FORD Solomon attempts to carry himself, but he cannot.
FORD He falls to the ground and passes out.
As we come into the scene, Solomon lays on a blanket on the floor.
Eventually, his eyes flutter, then open.
He is in the foyer of the Ford house.
As he gets his bearings, he looks around the interior.
THE SPACE IS HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED.
It is sharp contrast to the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has largely been accustom to during his time of slavery.
It will be the "first and last time such a sumptuous resting place was granted" during his twelve years of bondage.
60.
Solomon doesn't have much chance to luxuriate in his surroundings.
He hears a DOG BARKING just outside, and is unnerved.
Has Tibeats returned to finish what he started?
From a study, Master Ford appears with a gun in hand.
He goes to the door, opens it and looks outside.
He can see nothing.
Satisfied, Ford crosses back over to Solomon.
He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation.
FORD I believe Tibeats is skulkin' about the premises somewhere.
FORD He wants you dead, and he will attempt to have you so.
FORD It's no longer safe for you here.
FORD And I don't believe you will remain passive if Tibeats attacks.
FORD I have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps.
FORD He will take charge of you.
SOLOMON Master Ford, you must know; I am not a slave.
FORD I cannot hear that.
SOLOMON Before I came to you I was a freeman.
FORD I am trying to save your life!
FORD And...I have a debt to be mindful of.
FORD That, now, is to Edwin Epps.
FORD He is a hard man.
FORD Prides himself on being a "nigger breaker."
FORD But truthfully I could find no others who would have you.
FORD You've made a reputation of yourself.
FORD Whatever your circumstances, you are an exceptional nigger, Platt.
FORD I fear no good will come of it.
From the back porch, we come into the scene on EDWIN EPPS; a repulsive and coarse man.
His language gives speedy and unequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed the advantages of an education.
61.
Epps reads the Bible to his slaves, eight of them altogether.
ABRAM; a tall, older slave of about sixty years.
WILEY, who is forty eight.
PHEBE, who is married to Wiley.
BOB and HENRY who are Phebe's children, EDWARD and PATSEY.
Patsey is young, just 23 years old...though in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day.
She is the offspring of a "Guinea nigger," brought over to Cuba in a slave ship.
She nearly brims with unconversant sexuality.
MISTRESS EPPS, Epps's wife, is also present.
She sits with, holds quite lovingly, some SLAVE CHILDREN.
WITH THEM SHE IS VERY "MOTHERLY."
We also see Epps's overseer TREACH.
Treach constantly sports a LOADED PISTOL.
Though Epps reads the word of the Lord, he lacks the tone of compassion with which Ford read.
EPPS "And that servant which knew his Lord's will...WHICH KNEW HIS LORD'S WILL and prepared not himself...PREPARED NOT HIMSELF, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes..."
EPPS D'ye hear that?
EPPS "Stripes."
EPPS That nigger that don't take care, that don't obey his lord - that's his master - d'ye see?
EPPS - that 'ere nigger shall be beaten with many stripes.
EPPS Now, "many" signifies a great many.
EPPS Forty, a hundred, a hundred and fifty lashes...
EPPS That's Scripter!
picking cotton ferociously.
As we move out, we identify PATSEY, a 23 year old striking black woman.
The camera moves out again to a wider shot.
This reveals several lines of slaves picking cotton, with Patsey way out in the lead.
We cut to another pair of black hands.
This time, revealing SOLOMON, clumsy and unskilled hands, picking cotton.
A lash bears down on him.
It is August, "cotton picking" season.
We are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom.
It presents a visual purity, like an immaculate expanse of light, new-fallen snow.
The cotton grows from five to seven feet high, each stalk having a great many branches
62.
91 CONTINUED: 91 shooting out in all directions and lapping each other above the water furrow.
There is a slave to each side of the row.
They have a sack around their necks that hangs to the ground, the mouth of the sack about breast high.
Baskets are placed at the end of the furrows.
Slaves dump their sacks of cotton in the baskets, then pick until their sacks are again filled.
Pick that cotton.
Move along now.
HEAT and a SPIRITUAL SUNG BY THE SLAVES.
Despite the heat, there is no stopping for water.
The slaves are "driven" by Edward, who is himself "driven" by Treach.
TREACH C'mon.
TREACH Drive dem niggers.
TREACH Edward moves among the slaves, applying the whip to them without regard.
EDWARD Pick dat cotton.
EDWARD Move along now, hear?
The day's work is done.
The slaves are now assembled in the gin house with their baskets of cotton which are being weighed by Treach.
There is anxiety among the slave, the reason for which soon becomes apparent.
TREACH Two hundred forty pounds for Bob.
EPPS What yah got for James?
TREACH Two hundred ninety five pounds.
EPPS Tha's real good, boy.
EPPS Tha's real good.
TREACH One hundred eighty two pounds for Platt.
Epps does not look happy.
Treach says again:
63.
One hundred eighty two.
EPPS How much can even an average nigger pick a day?
TREACH Two hundred pounds.
EPPS This nigger ain't even average.
EPPS Epps pulls Solomon aside.
TREACH Five hundred twelve pounds for Patsey.
EPPS Five hundred twelve.
EPPS Yah men folk got no shame lettin' Patsey out pick yah?
EPPS The day ain't yet come she swung lower than five hundred pounds.
EPPS Queen of the fields, she is.
TREACH Two hundred six pou--
EPPS I ain't done, Treach.
EPPS Ain't I owed a minute to luxuriate on the work Patsey done?
TREACH ...Sir...
EPPS Damned Queen.
EPPS Born and bred to the field.
EPPS A nigger among niggers, and God give 'er to me.
EPPS A lesson in the rewards of righteous livin'.
EPPS All be observant ta that.
EPPS All!
Now, Treach.
Now speak.
TREACH One hundred thirty eight pounds for Phebe.
EPPS Hit one forty five yesterday.
EPPS Pull her out.
TREACH Two hundred six pounds for Wiley.
64.
EPPS How much he pick yesterday?
TREACH Two hundred twenty nine pounds.
TREACH Wiley is pulled from the line, huddled with Solomon.
In the distance, a flogging is going on.
Solomon, Phebe, and Wiley are stripped, placed in a stockade and now being given a perfunctory whipping delivered by ANOTHER
Evening, but the day is not yet done.
Slaves attend their various evening chores; feeding livestock, doing laundry, cooking food.
There is no respite from a slave's charge.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT A fire is kindled in the cabin.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT The slaves finally fix their own dinner of corn meal.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT Corn is ground in a small hand mill.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT The corn meal is mixed with a little water, placed in the fire and baked.

UNCLE ABRAM We all need pray to Heavenly Father da General reign over us always.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT The slaves are sleeping.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT There is a loud commotion.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT Epps enters, drunkenly, forcing the slaves awake.
65.
EPPS Get up!
EPPS Get up, we dance tonight!
EPPS We will not waste the evenin' with yer laziness.
EPPS Get up.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT Despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and now fully dressed.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT They take up position in the middle of the floor.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT They wait, poised like actors.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT Solomon strikes up a tune; Henry joins in with a pan flute and the slaves dance.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT They do so very wearily.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT The whole of it certainly more torture than pleasure.
Epps, whip in hand:
EPPS Where's yah merriment?
EPPS Move yer feet.
EPPS As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on Patsey.
EPPS It should be quite clear that his primary motivation for holding dances is so that he may view Patsey twirl about the floor.
EPPS This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps.
EPPS A few moments of Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear.
EPPS Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE.
EPPS With all her might she throws it at Patsey.
EPPS It hits Patsey square in the face.
EPPS TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR.
EPPS The dancing, the music stop.
EPPS The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first time they've seen as much from the Mistress.
Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion:
MISTRESS EPPS Sell her!
EPPS C'mon, now.
EPPS Wha's this?
MISTRESS EPPS You will sell the negress!
EPPS You're talkin' foolish.
EPPS Sell little Pats?
EPPS She pick with more vigor than any other nigger!
EPPS Choose another ta go.
MISTRESS EPPS No other.
MISTRESS EPPS Sell her!
EPPS I will not!
MISTRESS EPPS You will remove that black bitch from this property, 'er I'll take myself back to Cheneyville.
EPPS Back to that hog's trough where I found you?
EPPS Oh, the idleness of that yarn washes over me.
EPPS Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear.
EPPS That's a wager on which you will not profit.
EPPS Calm yerself.
EPPS And settle for my affection, 'cause my affection you got.
EPPS Or, go.
EPPS 'Cause I will rid myself of yah well before I do away with her!
EPPS Mistress Epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to even think of what to do.
EPPS Eventually, optionless, she storms away.
EPPS For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey sobbing.
EPPS (CONT'D) That damned woman!
EPPS (CONT'D) I won't have my mood spoiled.
EPPS (CONT'D) I will not.
EPPS (CONT'D) Dance!
EPPS (CONT'D) Epps sends the whip in Solomon's direction.
EPPS (CONT'D) Solomon responds by playing.
EPPS (CONT'D) Treach literally drags the prone Patsey from the floor, blood still spilling from her face.
EPPS (CONT'D) The slaves, as ordered, return to dancing.
The sun has only just risen above the horizon.
FROM THE GREAT HOUSE THE HORN IS BLOWN signaling the start of another day.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/FIELD - DAY Slaves are in the field picking cotton.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/FIELD - DAY They accompany their work with a SPIRITUAL.
As the slaves make their way in from the field, the Mistress calls to Solomon.
SHE HAS A PIECE OF PAPER IN
MISTRESS EPPS Platt...
SOLOMON Yes, Mistress.
MISTRESS EPPS Can you find your way to Bartholomew's?
SOLOMON I can, ma'am.
SOLOMON Handing Solomon a sheet of paper.
MISTRESS EPPS This is a list of goods and sundries.
MISTRESS EPPS You will take it to be filled and return immediately.
MISTRESS EPPS Tell Bartholomew to add it to our debt.
SOLOMON I will, Mistress.
SOLOMON Solomon looks at the list.
SOLOMON In a careless moment, Solomon reads quietly from it.
SOLOMON He catches himself, but not before the Mistress notes his action.
SOLOMON With high
MISTRESS EPPS Where yah from, Platt?
SOLOMON I have told you.
MISTRESS EPPS Tell me again.
SOLOMON Washington.
MISTRESS EPPS Who were yah Master?
SOLOMON Master name of Freeman.
MISTRESS EPPS Was he a learned man?
SOLOMON I suppose so.
MISTRESS EPPS He learn yah ta read?
68.
SOLOMON A word here or there, but I have no understanding of the written text.
MISTRESS EPPS Don't trouble yer self with it.
MISTRESS EPPS Same as the rest, Master bought yah to work.
MISTRESS EPPS Tha's all.
MISTRESS EPPS And any more'll earn yah a hun'red lashes.
MISTRESS EPPS Having delivered her cool advice, Mistress heads back into the house.
EXT. ROAD - DAY Solomon walks along a well-worn path, shopping bag draped over one shoulder.
EXT. ROAD - DAY We see his feet.
EXT. ROAD - DAY As the walk slowly gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense foliage.
EXT. ROAD - DAY His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods.
EXT. ROAD - DAY The sound of branches cracking underneath.
EXT. ROAD - DAY His feet, heartbeat and breath almost deafening.
EXT. ROAD - DAY He is desperate.
EXT. ROAD - DAY The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is silence.
EXT. ROAD - DAY We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, preparing for a lynching of two young men.
EXT. ROAD - DAY Solomon's eyes meet theirs.
EXT. ROAD - DAY The two men look back at Solomon with a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose around their neck.
EXT. ROAD - DAY Suddenly the bloodhounds start barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of Solomon.
EXT. ROAD - DAY Solomon's whole body shakes with anticipation.
Boy, where are you going?
SOLOMON (almost tripping over
To the store, Sir, to Bartholomew's.
I was sent there by Mistress Epps.
The patroller reaches out for Solomon's free pass around his neck, yanking him forward.
He looks at it.
PATROLLER Get there and get there quick.
PATROLLER The patroller kicks Solomon hard, sending him on his way.
PATROLLER Solomon walks on, looking one more time at the two young men; again there is a moment of connection.
PATROLLER Solomon turns.
PATROLLER The two men are hoisted up, kicking and spitting, behind his shoulder.
PATROLLER Solomon finds himself back on the trail walking towards Bartholomew's, his face now full of shock and
A101 CONTINUED: A101 trepidation.
He walks, fighting to calm himself down.
We move behind him as he continues his journey, a lonely figure.
A general store in the township of Holmesville.
Solomon stands at the counter as BARTHOLOMEW fills Mistress Epps's order.
Among the items set before Solomon is a
The items are collected for Solomon and placed in a sack.
Solomon giving little thought to them other than getting them back to the mistress.
As he turns, he glimpses the regalia of slave restraints, of all different guises; chains, muzzles for sale.
Solomon returns and delivers the items to the Mistress.
MISTRESS EPPS Any trouble?
SOLOMON No, ma'am.
SOLOMON No trouble.
Sitting on the Grand house's Piazza, Patsey is having tea with MISTRESS HARRIET SHAW, WHO IS A BLACK WOMAN.
Though once a slave, she is now comparatively refined though not wholly so.
The table where they sit is adorned with white linens, and they are attended by a HOUSE NIGGER.
It makes for a tranquil surreal scene.
69.
A105 EXT.
ROAD - DAY A105
Solomon is running flat out along the road.
Running as though his life depended on getting to his destination in beyond a timely manner.
B105 EXT.
SHAW'S HOUSE - DAY B105
Still running, slick with sweat, Solomon comes upon the
As Solomon arrives:
MASTER SHAW Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.
SOLOMON Good morning, Master Shaw.
SOLOMON I've been sent by Master to retrieve Patsey.
SOLOMON May I approach?
MASTER SHAW You may.
MASTER SHAW Solomon makes his way over to the piazza.
SOLOMON Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.
MISTRESS SHAW Nigger Platt.
SOLOMON My apologies.
SOLOMON Patsey, Master wishes you to return.
PATSEY Sabbath day.
PATSEY I's free ta roam.
SOLOMON Understood.
SOLOMON But the Master sent me running to fetch you, and said no time should be wasted.
MISTRESS SHAW Drink tea?
SOLOMON Thank you, Mistress, but I don't dare.
MISTRESS SHAW Would you knowed Massa Epps's consternation ta be any lessened wit your timely return?
MISTRESS SHAW Sit.
MISTRESS SHAW Sit and drink the tea that offered.
70.
B105 CONTINUED: B105 Solomon knows better, but he sits and the Mistress has tea poured for him.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) What'n was Epps's concern?
SOLOMON ...I'd rather not say...
MISTRESS SHAW L'il gossip on the Sabbath be fine.
MISTRESS SHAW All things in moderation.
MISTRESS SHAW Solomon is not sure what to say.
MISTRESS SHAW He struggles to be as diplomatic as possible.
SOLOMON As you are aware, Master Epps can be a man of a hard countenance.
SOLOMON There are times when it is impossible to account for his logic.
SOLOMON You know he has ill feelings toward your husband.
MISTRESS SHAW He do.
SOLOMON Master Epps has somehow come to believe, as incorrectly as it may be, that Master Shaw is...
SOLOMON That he is something of a lothario and an unprincipled man.
SOLOMON A misguided belief born out of their mutual competition as planters, no doubt.
MISTRESS SHAW No doubt...if not born outta truth itself.
MISTRESS SHAW The Mistress waves to Shaw.
MISTRESS SHAW Shaw, unsuspecting of the conversation, waves back.
SOLOMON I'm certain Patsey's well being is Master Epps's only concern.
MISTRESS SHAW Nothin' Epps desire come outta concern.
SOLOMON I meant no disrespect.
MISTRESS SHAW He ain't heard you.
71.
B105 CONTINUED: (2) B105
SOLOMON I meant no disrespect to you, Mistress.
MISTRESS SHAW Ha!
MISTRESS SHAW You worry for me?
MISTRESS SHAW Got no cause to worry for my sensibilities.
MISTRESS SHAW I ain't felt the end of a lash in 'mo years than I cain recall.
MISTRESS SHAW Ain't worked a field, neither.
MISTRESS SHAW Where one time I served, now I got others servin' me.
MISTRESS SHAW The cost to my current existence be Massa Shaw broadcasting his affections, 'n me enjoyin' his pantomime of fidelity.
MISTRESS SHAW If that what keep me from the cotton pickin' niggers, that what it be.
MISTRESS SHAW A small and reasonable price to be paid 'fo sure.
Looking toward Patsey, speaking with great empathy:
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) I knowed what it like to be the object of Massa's predilections and peculiarities.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) And I knowed they can get expressed with kindness or wit violence.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) A lusty visit in the night, or a visitation from the whip.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) And wit my experience, if'n I can give comfort, then comfort I give.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) And you take comfort, Patsey; the Good Lord will manage Epps.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) In His own time the Good Lord will manage dem all.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) Yes, Lordy, there's a day comin' that will burn as an oven.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) It comin' as sure as the Lord is just.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) When His will be done...the curse on the Pharos is a poor example of all that wait 'fo the plantation class.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) Mistress Shaw turns her head to the side, catching a slave's attention.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) As she does so, the slave, a YOUNG WOMAN, commences to pour tea.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip of her tea.
EPPS'S PLANTATION - LATER Solomon and Patsey are returning from Shaw's.
EPPS'S PLANTATION - LATER Waiting on the porch of the Great House, a drunk Epps beckons for Patsey, his lewd intentions obvious.
EPPS Pats...!
EPPS Patsey!
SOLOMON Do not look in his direction.
SOLOMON Continue on.
SOLOMON Epps does not care to be ignored.
SOLOMON He lifts himself and moves toward the pair in a rage.
EPPS Patsey...!
EPPS Solomon moves between Epps and Patsey, cutting Epps off as Patsey continues on.
EPPS Playing up his "ignorance" of
SOLOMON Found her, Master, and brought her back just as instructed.
EPPS What'd you jus now tell her?
EPPS What'd you say to Pats?
SOLOMON No words were spoken.
SOLOMON None of consequence.
EPPS Lie!
EPPS Damned liar!
EPPS Saw you talkin' with 'er.
EPPS Tell me!
SOLOMON I cannot speak of what did not occur.
SOLOMON Epps grabs Solomon.
EPPS I'll cut your black throat.
EPPS Solomon pulls away from Epps, RIPPING HIS SHIRT IN THE PROCESS.
EPPS Epps gives chase.
EPPS Solomon begins to run around the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance.
EPPS Epps, however is undeterred.
EPPS He moves after Solomon as speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.
EPPS And quickly he tires.
EPPS Epps is forced to bend over and suck air.
EPPS Solomon maintains his distance, barely breathing hard.
EPPS His breath returned to him, Epps starts up the chase again.
EPPS Solomon runs on out of reach.
EPPS Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath...
EPPS And now in what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after Solomon.
EPPS Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can even get close to the slave.
Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety:
73.
EPPS (CONT'D) Platt...
EPPS (CONT'D) Platt, liquor filled me.
EPPS (CONT'D) I admit that it did, and I done over reacted.
EPPS (CONT'D) It's the Lord's day.
EPPS (CONT'D) Ain't nothin' Christian in us carryin' on like this.
EPPS (CONT'D) Help me ta my feet, and let us both pray to the Lord for forgiveness.
EPPS (CONT'D) Epps extends a hand to Solomon.
EPPS (CONT'D) Cautiously, Solomon moves close, but not too close.
EPPS (CONT'D) As Solomon draws within striking distance, Epps lunges for him.
EPPS (CONT'D) He chases Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more
drops down.
And again offering a treaty:
EPPS (CONT'D) I'm all done in, Platt.
EPPS (CONT'D) I have met my limitations, and I ain't equal to 'em.
EPPS (CONT'D) I concede to yah, but in the name of valor, help yer master to his feet.
EPPS (CONT'D) Solomon cautiously moves closer to help.
EPPS (CONT'D) Again he is attacked by Epps - this time by knife.
EPPS (CONT'D) Sort of.
EPPS (CONT'D) Epps is too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and chased far around the field by Epps.
EPPS (CONT'D) ALL OF THE
Mistress Epps comes running from the house to the pair.
MISTRESS EPPS What?
MISTRESS EPPS Wha's the fuss?
SOLOMON A misunderstanding is all.
SOLOMON It began when I was sent to retrieve Patsey from where she'd taken sabbatical at Master Shaw's.
SOLOMON Upon returning, Master Epps believed Patsey and me to be in conversation when we were not.
SOLOMON I tried to explain, but it lead to all this.
MISTRESS EPPS What is it?
MISTRESS EPPS Ya cain't remain the Sabbath without her under your eye?
MISTRESS EPPS Ya are a no-account bastard.
EPPS Hold a moment...
MISTRESS EPPS A filthy, godless heathen.
MISTRESS EPPS My bed is too holy for yah ta share.
EPPS Wha's...wha's he been tellin' yah?
MISTRESS EPPS Of yer misbegotten ways.
EPPS And he would know what of anythin'?
EPPS I ain't even spoken with him today.
EPPS Platt, yah lyin' nigger, have I?
EPPS Have I?
EPPS Discretion being the better part and all, Solomon remains silent.
EPPS (CONT'D) There; there's all the truth he got.
EPPS (CONT'D) Damned nigger.
EPPS (CONT'D) Damn yah.
EPPS (CONT'D) Epps pushes his way past the Mistress.
With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are working the field picking cotton.
As before THEY SING A SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the tedium at hand.
But there is no distracting from the heat.
We see Henry begin to falter before it...
And eventually collapse right in the dirt.
Though the other slaves take note, none move to help him.
None dare.
From Treach rather matter of factly:
TREACH Get him water.
TREACH Edward runs to fetch a gourd.
TREACH He carries it to Henry,
Roused, Henry rights himself.
EDWARD Go'won.
EDWARD Git up.
EDWARD Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking cotton.
EDWARD He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the song is all that can keep him going.
The slaves are asleep.
Epps arrives, again without knocking, with his whip in hand.
The slaves stir.
Uncle
UNCLE ABRAM We dance tonight, massa?
UNCLE ABRAM Epps remains quietly focused on Patsey.
UNCLE ABRAM And it's clear from her apprehensive expression just what it is he's come looking for.
UNCLE ABRAM This time there is no escaping it.
UNCLE ABRAM As if to acknowledge the badness to come, Phebe lightly cries.
On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house - Epps shoves Patsey.
He stops, stands as if gathering his manhood, then he's all over Patsey.
He is rough and clumsy.
It looks like something between an awkward rape and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter.
Patsey does not respond in any way other than to continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain as still as possible.
If there is such a thing, she is vicious with her passive aggressiveness.
Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to violence.
He begins slapping Patsey to get a response from her.
When that fails, he punches her which only leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey MERCILESSLY.
Still, she gives him nothing.
Beaten, Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep breathing above her.
The desire for sex now having left him.
Epps heads from the field.
Patsey is left where she is.
As before, Solomon waits as Bartholomew fills Mistress Epps order.
Among the items set before Solomon is another quantity of foolscap.
ROAD - DAY Solomon is making his way back to the Epps plantation.
ROAD - DAY He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the store.
ROAD - DAY As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY.
ROAD - DAY When he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he folds and places in his pocket.
ROAD - DAY That done, he cinches up the sack and continues on his way.
76.
Solomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his fiddle.
Perhaps the safest place he can think of.
He acts as though he's hiding away found gold.
In reality it's more than that.
For Solomon the paper is a first step toward freedom.
It's another night of Epps's forced revelry.
Coming in quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to dance.
Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked pastries.
She sets them down on a table.
MISTRESS EPPS A moment from the dancing.
MISTRESS EPPS Come sample what I baked for y'all.
MISTRESS EPPS The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food, file toward the tray reciting a chorus of "Thank you,
Mistress."
As Patsey moves toward the pastries:
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) There'll be none for you, Patsey.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Patsey merely turns away.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Her non responsiveness,
however, serves only to incite the Mistress.
Screaming:
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Yah see that?
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Did yah see the look of insolence she give me?
EPPS Seen nothin' but her turn away.
MISTRESS EPPS Are you blind or ignorant?
MISTRESS EPPS It was hot, hateful scorn.
MISTRESS EPPS It filled that black face.
MISTRESS EPPS Yah tell me yah did'n see it, then yah choose not to look, or yah sayin' I lie.
EPPS Whatever it was, it passed.
MISTRESS EPPS Is that how yah are with the niggers?
MISTRESS EPPS Let every ill thought fester inside 'em.
MISTRESS EPPS Look at 'em.
77.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) They foul with it; foul with their hate.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) You let it be, it'll come back to us in the dark a night.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Yah want that?
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Yah want them black animals to leave us gut like pigs in our own sleep?
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Epps isn't sure how to respond to the inchoate berating.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) It's an invitation for the Mistress to continue.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) You are manless.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) A damned eunuch if ever there was.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) And if yah won't stand for me, I'd pray you'd at least be a credit to yer own kind and beat every foul thought from 'em.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Epps does nothing.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) The Mistress lets her anger loose.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) She moves quickly to Patsey, DRIVES HER NAILS INTO THE
the moment marked with appropriate screams.
Patsey collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Beat it from 'em!
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistress's actions, Epps takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) His intentions are plain.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) All the slaves remain silent.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) The Mistress, however,
displaying high satisfaction, entreats the others:
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Eat.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Fill yourselves.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) ...And then we dance.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) The slaves eat, but without a hint of levity.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT We come up on the slaves who lay sleeping.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT All except for Patsey.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT She rises from her bedding, goes to a corner of the cabin and removes something from a secretive location.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT She then moves over to Platt.
PATSEY Platt...
PATSEY Platt, you awake?
SOLOMON I am.
PATSEY I have a request; an act of kindness.
Patsey displays what she took from hiding.
It is a
PATSEY (CONT'D) I secreted it from the Mistress.
SOLOMON Return it!
PATSEY It yours, Platt.
SOLOMON For what cause?
PATSEY All I ask: end my life.
PATSEY Take my body to the margin of the swamp-- Solomon looks at Patsey as though she were insane.
SOLOMON No.
PATSEY Take me by the throat.
PATSEY Hold me low in the water until I's still 'n without life.
PATSEY Bury me in a lonely place of dyin'.
SOLOMON No!
SOLOMON I will do no such thing.
SOLOMON The...the gory detail with which
PATSEY I thought on it long and hard.
SOLOMON It is melancholia, nothing more.
SOLOMON How does such despair even come to you?
PATSEY How can you not know?
PATSEY I got no comfort in this life.
PATSEY If I cain't buy mercy from yah, I'll beg it.
SOLOMON There are others.
SOLOMON Beg them.
PATSEY I'm begging you!
SOLOMON Why?
SOLOMON Why would you consign me to damnation with such an un-Godly request?
79.
PATSEY There is God here!
PATSEY God is merciful, and He forgive merciful acts.
PATSEY Won't be no hell for you.
PATSEY Do it.
PATSEY Do what I ain't got the strength ta do myself.
PATSEY Solomon says nothing.
PATSEY Clearly he's not about to do the deed.
PATSEY With nothing else to do, knowing she is damned with every breath she draws, Patsey crawls back to her spot on the floor and lays herself down.
Hard times on the planation.
Where previously the field in bloom was a carpet of white, it is now patchy and under grown.
The slaves move through the field picking not cotton, but rather COTTON WORMS from the plants.
The cotton worms have dined on the cotton and nearly destroyed the crop.
We see the cotton worms in extreme close-up, moving among and destroying the cotton crop.
Epps is beside himself as he looks out over his ruined field.
EPPS It is a plague.
TREACH Cotton worm.
EPPS A plague!
EPPS It's damn Biblical.
EPPS Two season God done sent a plague to smite me.
EPPS I am near ruination.
EPPS Why, Treach?
EPPS What I done that God hate me so?
EPPS Do I not preach His word?
TREACH The whole Bayou sufferin'.
EPPS I don't care nothin' fer the damn Bayou.
EPPS I'm sufferin'.
EPPS Epps looks among his slaves at work, his enmity growing.
EPPS (CONT'D) It's that Godless lot.
EPPS (CONT'D) They brought this on me.
EPPS (CONT'D) I bring 'em
EPPS (CONT'D) God's word, and heathens they are, they brung me God's scorn.
EPPS (CONT'D) Crazed, Epps runs into the field, taking himself from slave to slave delivering a whipping to all he can lay his hands on.
EPPS (CONT'D) Damn you!
EPPS (CONT'D) Damn you all!
EPPS (CONT'D) Damn you!
Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon sit in the back of a cart.
SOLOMON HAS HIS FIDDLE WITH HIM.
Epps has delivered the men to JUDGE TURNER, a distinguished man and extensive planter whose large estate is situated on Bayou Salle within a few miles of the gulf.
Epps and Turner stand off to one side engaged in bargaining as Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon wait and watch.
One of the slaves whisper under their breath.
I hear cutting cane is twice as hard as picking cotton.
BOB But at least we'll be away from Master Epps.
UNCLE ABRAM Boy, you two have no sense.
UNCLE ABRAM Epps returns to his slaves and gives a parting salutation.
EPPS Yer Judge Turner's for the season.
EPPS More if need be, until my crop return.
EPPS Yah'll bring no disrespect to me, and yah'll bring no biblical plagues to him.
EPPS Be decent, ere mark my words, I will deliver an ungodly whippin'.
Slaves are crammed into the shack - LITERALLY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER - as they try to sleep.
Some lay, some sit up.
Packed in like cattle, there is barely room to move let alone draw a deep, clean breath.
There is a real risk of suffocating in the mass.
Some cough and wheeze.
Among them is Solomon who must believe at this point that his life has reached its very lowest point.
The odds of survival are slight, let alone the chance of actually ever returning to his family.
This clearly weighs on him as he struggles to find anything like comfortable space in the pen.
CANE FIELDS - DAY An OVERSEER is explaining to the new slaves - SOLOMON AMONG THEM - how to cultivate cane.
CANE FIELDS - DAY WITH A KNIFE IN HAND
he demonstrates the process:
Draw the cane from the rick, cut the top and flags from the stalk, understand?
Leave only that part which is sound and healthy.
Cast off the rest...
ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES are working the field.
They are divided into THREE GANGS.
The first which draw the cane, the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the rows after.
Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves with speed and skill.
Certainly more so than he displayed picking cotton.
Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches.
SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT Again, the slaves have been herded into the shack and pressed together.
SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT As he tries to rest - sleep is nearly impossible - Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, ANNA.
SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT She is awake.
SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT For a few beats she avoids eye contact with Solomon.
SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT She seems, like Solomon, to be unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened by them.
SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's.
SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT She makes no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes.
SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely stand to face.
SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT Fear, proximity...
SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT They drive her hand
121 CONTINUED: 121 to Solomon's.
After a moment of seemingly reacquainting herself with genuine human contact, the woman TAKES
82.
SOLOMON'S HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST.
Solomon tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE.
Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her breast.
Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act - really, neither does Anna.
THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE
The need quickly compounds.
Anna presses her lips to Solomon's.
Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS.
Solomon, with slightly more compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND.
The act remains more perfunctory than passionate.
We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual release.
But more - or substantially less - than joyous sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against reality.
But the feeling quickly fades.
All that remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.
And there is shame, too.
This is put on display as Anna turns away from Solomon.
As quickly as it began, it is as though the act had not happened at all.
Solomon waits outside the house on the porch.
A house servant - ZACHARY - approaches and admonishes Solomon.
Off the porch.
Get off.
Like a dog shooed away, Solomon steps down.
Eventually Judge Turner exits the house and crosses to Solomon.
SOLOMON ...Sir...
JUDGE TURNER Platt is it?
JUDGE TURNER Have you cultivated cane previously?
SOLOMON No, sir, I have not.
JUDGE TURNER You take to it quite naturally.
JUDGE TURNER Are you educated?
83.
SOLOMON Niggers are hired to work, not to read and write.
SOLOMON Turner gives that a bit of consideration as he gives Solomon a wary looking over.
JUDGE TURNER You play the fiddle?
SOLOMON I do.
JUDGE TURNER Willard Yarney, a planter up the bayou, celebrates his anniversary in a three week's time.
JUDGE TURNER I will hold out your name to him.
JUDGE TURNER What you earn is yours to keep.
SOLOMON Sir.
JUDGE TURNER Mind yourself, Platt.
SOLOMON Yes, sir.
Work over, the slaves congregate to eat.
As Solomon eats, he takes note of the JUICE FROM SOME
Solomon plays with a piece of cane, fashions it into some kind of writing tool, testing it in the mud.
He then brushes over the dirt with his hand.
84.
Secreted away out near the edge of the bayou and sitting by a small fire, Solomon takes the slip of paper from his fiddle.
It is yellowed, showing age, but still usable.
Dipping the piece of cane - a quill - into the crushed berries, Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper.
The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink.
Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle.
He has some scraps of food with him, which he snacks on.
A127A INT.
SLAVE SHACK - DAY A127A
We see a sharp object scratching onto a surface.
The tool moves on to form another mark.
The sound is repetitive and almost unbearable.
As we move out, we see the names Anne, Margaret, Alonzo.
They are engraved onto the violin, in the hidden area where Solomon would rest his chin.
Solomon looks at it for a moment, moving his fingertips across the engraving.
His face full of loss.
Sadly, he lifts his instrument under his chin and leaning his head to the side as if to play.
A party has commenced at the noble home of one MR.
YARNEY.
A group of REVELERS have gathered and are on the dance floor, in fancy dress.
Their faces are covered with a variation of decorative masks.
The party is a feast of celebration.
As entertainment, SOLOMON ACCOMPANIES A GROUP OF MUSICIANS, no more than three.
And as he does so, they all play with jovial liveliness.
Clearly a good time is being had by all.
His playing done for the evening, Solomon is returning to Judge Turner's on foot.
There is only the moonlight with which to light the way.
As he walks, Solomon eats from a HEARTY CHUCK OF BREAD.
Obviously part of his haul from the evening.
Solomon again hears noises coming from the brush just up ahead of him.
Solomon tears off some of the bread, kneels and holds it out before him.
SOLOMON C'mere.
SOLOMON C'mon, boy.
85.
This time, there is no dog.
Instead, from the dark and the brush step TWO BLACK MEN.
Solomon stands.
He looks the men over - their clothes tatters and they themselves covered in dirt.
It becomes quite clear they are not just slaves.
A fact confirmed when they step menacingly toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND.
At first it seems they want Solomon's food or money.
Worse, THEY GO FOR HIS FIDDLE.
Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is attacked, TAKING A CUT TO THE ARM.
Solomon fights back, PICKING UP A PINE KNOT and striking his attacker over the head.
That takes the fight out of him, and both men retreat back the way they came leaving Solomon be.
EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT Outside of the slave shacks Solomon's wound tended by
Uncle Abram.
As he works on it:
UNCLE ABRAM Runaways I would expect.
UNCLE ABRAM The Bayou full with 'em.
UNCLE ABRAM They nothin' 'mo dangerous than a nigger in flight.
SOLOMON They acted out of desperation.
UNCLE ABRAM Act outta lunacy.
UNCLE ABRAM Heads fulla stories 'bout life up north.
UNCLE ABRAM Yah ever been north, Platt?
SOLOMON ...No...
UNCLE ABRAM And never should yah be.
UNCLE ABRAM I hope that yah never bear witness the sorry condition of the northern black.
UNCLE ABRAM Got neither no purpose, nor direction.
UNCLE ABRAM They jus...they jus fall about the streets in search of sustenance of both body and spirit.
SOLOMON You know this to be so?
UNCLE ABRAM Two of my massas tolt me.
86.
A129 CONTINUED: A129
Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON.
As he plays, something appears in the distance.
From the edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen from the earth, is CELESTE.
She is a young woman of about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks.
FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD."
Beyond that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely.
Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water.
Draped on her dress, her period.
A line in her skirt.
It's very visible, but not shocking.
A ribbon of red in her dress.
Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation.
As Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite
CELESTE I am hungry.
CELESTE Give me food.
SOLOMON Who are you?
CELESTE I'm hungry.
CELESTE Solomon gives Celeste some of his food.
CELESTE Celeste, famished, devours it.
SOLOMON What is your name?
CELESTE My name is Celeste.
SOLOMON What are your circumstances?
CELESTE I belong ta Massa Carey, and 'ave been two days among da palmettoes.
CELESTE Celeste is sick and cain't work, and would rather die in the swamp
CELESTE (CONT'D) than be whipped to death by the overseer.
CELESTE (CONT'D) So I took myself away.
CELESTE (CONT'D) Massa's dogs won't follow me.
CELESTE (CONT'D) The patrollers 'ave tried to set dem on me.
CELESTE (CONT'D) But dey a secret between dem and Celeste, and dey won't mind the devilish orders of the overseer.
CELESTE (CONT'D) Celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws.
CELESTE (CONT'D) Do you believe me?
SOLOMON Yes.
CELESTE Why?
SOLOMON There are some whose tracks the hounds will refuse to follow.
CELESTE Give me more food.
CELESTE I'm starvin'.
SOLOMON This is all my allowance for the
CELESTE Give it to me.
CELESTE Almost as if compelled, Solomon does as ordered.
CELESTE As she
eats, Celeste aggrandizes herself:
CELESTE (CONT'D) Most slaves escape at night.
CELESTE (CONT'D) The overseers are alert for such chicanes.
CELESTE (CONT'D) But Celeste tricked dem 'n alight in the middle of the day wit the sun up at its highest.
CELESTE (CONT'D) The place of my concealment now deep in the swamp, not half a mile from Massa's plantation, and a world apart.
CELESTE (CONT'D) A world a tall trees whose long arms make fo' a canopy so dense dey keep away even the beams of the sun.
CELESTE (CONT'D) It twilight always in Celeste's world, even in the brightest day.
CELESTE (CONT'D) I will live there, and I will live freely.
CELESTE (CONT'D) The overseers are a cowardly lot.
CELESTE (CONT'D) Dey will not go where their dogs show fear and where it always be night.
CELESTE (CONT'D) Others will join me in the twilight, and we ain't gunna be slaves no 'mo forever.
88.
Solomon isn't sure what to say.
Before he can say
CELESTE (CONT'D) Celeste will come to you again in the night.
CELESTE (CONT'D) You will have food for her.
CELESTE (CONT'D) Celeste departs the way she came; as though she were a vision.
Solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed.
Dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is about.
Taking out a handkerchief, Solomon begins to load it with food.
Not too much.
Not so much his thievery will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself.
TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT Solomon plays his violin, but plays it with an anxious nature as he waits.
TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT Then, as before, a figure appears in the distance.
TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT It is Celeste coming out of the night.
TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT She makes her way
directly to Solomon.
With no greeting, she says:
CELESTE I am hungry.
CELESTE Solomon gives Celeste the handkerchief he's filled.
CELESTE She
opens it, and begins to devour the food.
As she eats:
CELESTE (CONT'D) I was rude, and didn't even ask yo name.
SOLOMON Platt.
Solomon.
Solomon is my true and free name.
CELESTE Was you free?
SOLOMON I was.
SOLOMON I am.
SOLOMON Solomon exposes his wrist, displays his tattoo as he
SOLOMON (CONT'D) I remain free in my heart.
Giving a laugh as though it's the silliest thing she's
CELESTE Free heart means nothin if'n yo body gunna die a slave.
SOLOMON I will not.
CELESTE How?
CELESTE Celeste knows you ain't gunna run.
CELESTE Celeste knows it ain't your nature.
SOLOMON I have a plan.
SOLOMON I have a letter.
CELESTE A letter?
CELESTE How'll yah mail da letter?
CELESTE Who yah trust to post it?
CELESTE A nigger that can read and write is a nigger that'll hang.
CELESTE There is a pause.
CELESTE Solomon can't answer this question.
CELESTE It is the glaring hole in his plan.
Having finished eating:
90.
CELESTE (CONT'D) Celeste will come again in de night.
CELESTE (CONT'D) You will bring her 'mo food.
SOLOMON I risk discovery to take more.
CELESTE You will bring Celeste 'mo food.
CELESTE And with that Celeste again moves back into the darkness.
Solomon is picking at the bark off a WHITE MAPLE.
In a tin cup, over a fire, Solomon boils the white maple bark in just a bit of water.
As others sleep, by the light of dying coals, Solomon uses the quill to test the boiled bark.
The liquid holds as a form of ink.
It is no?t ideal, but it is legible on the page.
Armed with this, Solomon writes his letter.
TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT Solomon sits with Celeste.
TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT He relates his news to her.
SOLOMON I have my letter.
CELESTE Yah has your freedom then?
SOLOMON All that remains is to contrive measures by which the letter can safely be deposited in the post office.
SOLOMON When Celeste speaks she is quite melancholy.
CELESTE I have resolved to return to my Massa.
CELESTE Solomon gives an unnerved look.
CELESTE This is not good news.
SOLOMON Is it more food you need?
CELESTE I live in fear.
SOLOMON None will come after you in the swamps.
CELESTE It ain't the patrollers I scared of...
CELESTE At all seasons the howling of wild animals can be heard at night along the border of the swamps.
CELESTE At first their calls were welcomin'.
CELESTE Dey too was free, 'n I thought dey greeted me like a sistah.
CELESTE Lately, dey cries have turned horrifyin'.
CELESTE They mean to kill Celeste.
SOLOMON The solitude plays tricks.
SOLOMON It's your impression, nothing more.
SOLOMON If you go back to your master you could face the same.
CELESTE My freedom been nothin' but a daydream.
CELESTE So was Celeste's thoughts of slaves conjoinin' in the bayou.
SOLOMON Better the loneliness.
SOLOMON You have been free most of the summer.
SOLOMON Return now and your master will make example of you.
CELESTE It is lonely dwellin' waiting for others who won't never come.
92.
SOLOMON Go north.
SOLOMON Make your way by night...
CELESTE It'll only be worse if'n Celeste don't go back of her own will.
SOLOMON You won't be caught.
SOLOMON The dogs won't track you.
SOLOMON You are...you are unique.
SOLOMON Celeste...
CELESTE You got alternatives, Solomon.
SOLOMON To return is to die!
CELESTE Celeste got no one to write a letter to.
CELESTE As if to punctuate her resolve, without a word more Celeste departs toward the swamp.
CELESTE Solomon starts on into the swamp after her.
SOLOMON Celeste...
SOLOMON Celeste!
SOLOMON Solomon continues after Celeste, wading deeper into the dark night and murky waters.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Celeste, I will guide you north!
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Wait, and I will take you.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Celeste is too nimble.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) She outpaces Solomon, continues on and disappears into the night.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Let me take you!
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Let me go with you!
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Solomon runs on, then splashes to a stop.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) He stumbles
around disoriented, calling into the blackness:
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Celeste...
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Nothing.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) No answer.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Not a human one.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) There are sounds and echoes - some in the distance, some perhaps moving closer - which, moment by moment, become more and more frightening.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then neck deep.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) With no way to orient himself, no means to guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to crumble.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) He thrashes in the water trying to find his way
93.
138 CONTINUED: (3) 138 back to shore.
No longer trying to save Celeste, Solomon calls to her - desperately - for assistance.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Celeste!
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Come to me, Celeste!
SOLOMON (CONT'D) In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this is his final moment.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) His panic should be that tangible.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Hauling himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses in a drenched, worn heap.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) His life spared, but Celeste never to be seen again.
We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation.
Epps stands in the drive.
He's in surprisingly good spirits as Solomon, Uncle Abram, Henry and Bob trudge their way wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are gathered.
The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully returned.
EPPS A joyous day.
EPPS A joyous day.
EPPS Dark times is behind us.
EPPS Clean livin' 'n prayer done lifted the plague.
Indicating to the cotton:
EPPS (CONT'D) As thick 'n white as New England snow.
EPPS (CONT'D) 'N now my niggers is returned to me.
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.
Oh, did you beguile him, Platt, with your slick nigger ways?
Well, yah won't stand idle, boy.
Not on my land.
Much work to do.
Days of old long since, eh?
Joyous!
Joyous indeed!
Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey who is lined up with the other slaves.
SHE IS NOW MORE HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER.
Her face and arms display many new scars.
It's clear that in the intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping boy for Epps and the Mistress.
94.
The slaves are out working on the field.
White hands appear, picking cotton: ARMSBY.
He is wholly unskilled at picking cotton, and he puts little effort into the job.
As we meet him he seems a decent sort if a little short on self-motivation.
In anachronistic terminology, he'd be called a "slacker."
He joins in with the slaves, singing a spiritual.
As Epps said, it is days of long since.
The slaves are back to having their cotton weighed in the Gin House
EPPS Wiley...?
TREACH Two hundred sixty pounds.
EPPS Bob?
TREACH Three hundred forty pounds for Bob.
EPPS Patsey?
TREACH Five hundred twenty pounds.
EPPS Tha's a girl.
EPPS Don't never let me down.
EPPS Platt?
TREACH One hundred sixty pounds.
TREACH Before Treach is even done announcing the weight, Epps has pulled Solomon aside to where Uncle Abram already awaits his fate.
EPPS Armsby?
TREACH Sixty four pounds.
TREACH Epps speaks to Armsby sternly, but nothing of the manner in which he would address the slaves.
EPPS A good days labor would average two hundred pounds.
ARMSBY Yes, sir.
EPPS I'm sure in time y'll develope as a picker, but it takes effort, boy.
EPPS Put some damn effort into it.
ARMSBY Yes, sir.
To Treach, regarding Solomon and Abram:
EPPS Take 'em out.
EPPS Get to whippin'.
EPPS No force is needed.
EPPS The slaves understand the situation.
EPPS They follow Treach out of the Gin house.
We come in after the punishment has been dealt.
Patsey tends to Uncle Abram's back as Armsby applies liniments to Solomon's.
As he does, Armsby muses:
ARMSBY It's a tragedy.
ARMSBY How does such come to pass?
ARMSBY Working a field and picking cotton like a lowly hand.
ARMSBY I'm of a damn sight better station.
ARMSBY And my desires never lacked for a grandiose component, though I will admit they have at times been short on ingenuity.
ARMSBY But only at times.
ARMSBY I've worked as an overseer, you know.
SOLOMON I did not, sir.
ARMSBY Not "sir."
ARMSBY Just Armsby.
ARMSBY Not owed more than any other in the field.
ARMSBY I worked plantations from Virginia, down into Alabama.
ARMSBY I could manage easy a hundred slaves and have done so.
ARMSBY But to toil in the field?
ARMSBY Never thought that would come to pass.
ARMSBY Never.
ARMSBY But times are desperate.
ARMSBY Where once I had said "no" to Epps and his merger offerings, I returned cap
96.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) in hand.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) ...Look at what I've become.
SOLOMON How did you arrive at such a place, if I may ask?
ARMSBY Ask.
ARMSBY It's just conversation.
ARMSBY From a pocket Armsby produces a flask.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) I became a little too dependant on the whisky, a little too undependable on the job.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) Before you say I'm just a sorry drunkard, let me state my case: As reliable employment as overseeing is, it's no easy chore on the spirit.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) I say no man of conscious can take the lash to another human day in, and day out without shredding at his own self.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) Takes him to a place where he either makes excuses within his mind to be unaffected...
ARMSBY (CONT'D) Or finds some way to trample his guilty sensations.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) Well, I trampled.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) Armsby takes a drink.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) And with frequency.
SOLOMON Where is your place of birth?
ARMSBY Maryland.
ARMSBY Have you traveled there?
SOLOMON ...I cannot say that I have.
ARMSBY Fine country.
ARMSBY More seasonal than the bayou.
ARMSBY A deal less humid.
SOLOMON Why did you leave it?
ARMSBY To make my fortune, of course.
ARMSBY I gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity that were the lore of the southern states: all that's needed being a patch of land and a few good growing seasons.
ARMSBY Cotton,
97.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) or tobacco.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) And then locating a proper bank in which to store your riches.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) But such profitable outcomes are reserved for the plantation masters.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) It's the lot of the rest of us to serve.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) So I settled on being an overseer, and failed as well at that.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) In the meantime my dreams gave way to reality.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) Now, I want nothing more than to earn a decent wage.
And get myself home.
Armsby takes another drink and leans back.
We again hear the sound of the HORN BLOWING signaling the start of the work day for the slave.
With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are working the field picking cotton.
As before they sing a spiritual, the only thing that distracts them from the tedium at hand.
But there is no distracting from the heat.
We see Uncle Abram begin to falter and finally drop down to the ground.
Treach calls to Edward:
TREACH Get him water.
TREACH Edward runs to fetch water which he carries to Abram and
At this point, the sounds of the singing from the others tapers off as they realize Abram isn't getting up.
We are beyond the main of the plantation, the cotton field in the background.
We are at the slaves' cemetery, a mixture of crude crosses and unsettled ground.
Solomon, Bob and Henry, now much visually older than when we first saw them, are digging a grave in the dirt.
The uncovered body of Abram lays near.
Having dug down an appropriate distance, the three men take the body and, very unceremoniously, place it into the ground.
Holding
98.
145 CONTINUED: 145 the shovel in his hands, and resting it by his feet, Bob tilts his head down and closes his eyes.
The others do the same.
Almost stutteringly, not really knowing what to
BOB I just want to say something about Uncle Abram.
BOB He was a good man and he always looked out for us since we were little.
BOB God Bless him.
BOB God love him.
BOB And God keep him.
BOB That done, they begin to cover it with dirt.
BOB It is all the more of a funeral that Abram will receive.
A148 EXT.
MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE CEMETERY - LATER A148
A female voice appears out of the blackness and begins to sing solo, "Went down to the river Jordan."
A response of "Oh Yeah" quickly follows.
Again the singer continues, "where John baptized three."
The same faces we have seen on Epps' plantation, but now filled with rapture, appear.
It's as if the voices have created a new form of awakening and presence.
It seems to transcend and translate in a strange way, joy.
A joy which has un-yet been seen on screen.
A joy which has been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there.
It's captivating, infectious.
This should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the seemingly chastising environment.
The singer continues, "Well some say John was a Baptist, some say John was a Jew, but I say John was a preacher, because the Bible says so too, preach on Johnny."
And with that, the rest of the congregation chant "I believe.
Oh, I believe."
Solomon goes to RETRIEVE THE SMALL PACKAGE FROM UNDER A ROCK AT THE BASE OF A TREE.
Solomon returns the letter to hiding.
He takes the money with him and cautiously moves from the area.
99.
The door opens.
Solomon enters.
Armsby is surprised to see him.
So much so, he isn't sure what greeting to give.
Solomon gives a blunt introduction.
Re: the
SOLOMON The proceeds of my fiddling performances.
SOLOMON A few picayunes, but all I have in the world.
SOLOMON I promise them to you if you will do me the favor I require.
SOLOMON But I beg you not to expose me if you cannot grant the request.
ARMSBY What do you ask?
SOLOMON First, your word, sir.
ARMSBY On my honor.
SOLOMON It is a simple enough request.
SOLOMON I ask only that you deposit a letter in the Marksville post office.
SOLOMON And that you keep the action an inviolable secret forever.
SOLOMON The details of the letter are of no consequence.
SOLOMON Even at that, there would be an imposition of much pain and suffering were it known I was the author.
SOLOMON A patron is what I require, sir.
ARMSBY Where's the letter now?
SOLOMON ...It is not yet written.
SOLOMON I will have it in a day.
SOLOMON Two at most, my skill with composition as poor as it is.
SOLOMON Armsby considers the request.
ARMSBY I will do it.
ARMSBY And will accept whatever payment is offered.
ARMSBY Solomon hesitates.
ARMSBY In the moment, he's not so sure he can wholly give himself over to trust.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) To assist you, I put my own self at risk.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) I will do so, but fair compensation is all I ask.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) Solomon hands over the money.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) Draw up your letter.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) We will meet again.
ARMSBY (CONT'D) In two days?
SOLOMON In two days.
SOLOMON ...Thank you.
SOLOMON Solomon exits.
Solomon and the slaves pick cotton.
Armsby is conspicuously NOT laboring in the field.
As Solomon works he is watched by Epps.
Watched more than he normally is.
For a moment it seems it might just be a matter of perspective; Solomon's unease over his actions.
But soon Epps is joined by Armsby.
The two men stand and talk, their looks locked toward Solomon.
Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues for a long, long moment.
But Epps makes no move toward Solomon.
Solomon continues with his work.
The slaves are at rest.
Gripping his whip Epps enters, without so much as a knock at the door.
For a moment there's curiosity; is he there for a dance, for Patsey...?
Looking right to Solomon:
EPPS Get up.
EPPS Solomon does.
EPPS Epps heads back out into the dark.
EPPS He says nothing, but his directive is clear: Follow me.
Solomon comes out into the dark.
Nearly hidden in the shadows is a bitter Epps.
Despite the lack of light, Epps's malevolence is quite clear.
His whip attached to his hip.
As he speaks, he stokes himself with swigs from a FLASK.
Epps puts his arm around Solomon, as if consoling a friend, and guides him into the woods.
EPPS Well, boy.
EPPS I understand I've got a larned nigger that writes
EPPS (CONT'D) letters and tries to get white fellows to mail 'em.
EPPS (CONT'D) Solomon, hardly missing a beat, plays this off.
EPPS (CONT'D) Well, Armsby tol' me today the devil was among my niggers.
EPPS (CONT'D) That I had one that needed close watchin' or he would run away.
EPPS (CONT'D) When I axed him why, he said you come over to him and waked him up in the middle of the night and wanted him to carry a letter to Marksville.
EPPS (CONT'D) What have yah got to say to that?
SOLOMON All I have to say, master, is all that need be said.
SOLOMON There is no truth in it.
EPPS You say.
SOLOMON How could I write a letter without ink or paper?
SOLOMON There is nobody I want to write to 'cause I hain't got no friends living as I know of.
SOLOMON That Armsby is a lying drunken fellow.
SOLOMON You know this, just as you know that I am constant in truth.
SOLOMON Now, master, I can see what that Armsby is after, plain enough.
SOLOMON Didn't he want you to hire him for an overseer?
SOLOMON A beat.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) That's it.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) He wants to make you believe we're all going to run away and then he thinks you'll hire an overseer to watch us.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) He believes you are soft soap.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) He's given to such talk.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) I believe he's just made this story out of whole cloth, 'cause he wants to get a situation.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) It's all a lie, master, you may depend on't.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) It's all a lie.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) For a tense moment we are unsure which way Epps'll go.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Increasingly it become apparent that, shallow minded and equally soused, Solomon has been able to fold Epps's thoughts.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) In a low curse that clearly states his ill intentions.
Revealed is a pocket knife, which all through the conversation, unknown to us the audience, was pushed up against Solomon's stomach.
As Epps speaks, he closes it and taps it on Solomon's shoulder.
EPPS I'm damned.
EPPS I'll be god...
EPPS Were he not free and white, Platt.
EPPS Were he not free and white.
EPPS Epps heads off.
EPPS Solomon is left to exhale a deep breath.
Having found a lonely spot, Solomon has struck a SMALL FIRE.
He has in his hand his letter.
With no ceremony, he casts the letter upon the flames and watches it burn.
And with it, at this time, seems all chance of him ever being free.
He stands and looks at it as if forever, as ashes descend into the night sky.
The slaves are now employed working on an extension to the Great House.
The slaves work under the direction of MR.
SAMUEL BASS, a between forty and fifty years old, of light complexion and light hair.
He is cool and self- possessed, fond of argument, but always speaking with extreme deliberation as well as a Canadian accent.
EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - DAY As the slaves continue to work, there is a conversation going on between Epps and Bass.
EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - DAY Bass much skilled in the art of sophistry, while Epps's arguments are fueled mostly by emotion alone.
EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - DAY Though at first Epps does little more than joke his way around the facts.
EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - DAY Solomon, working still, can't help but overhear as Epps offers Bass a drink, which Bass waves away.
EPPS Take it.
EPPS You look unsettled.
BASS I'm well.
EPPS No shame in taking respite from the heat; drink, shade.
EPPS It's ungodly for travelers.
EPPS Hearty, or otherwise.
B155 CONTINUED: B155 Bass gives a laugh.
EPPS (CONT'D) I meant no joke.
B155 CONTINUED: (2) B155
BASS Your humor is inadvertent.
BASS Sensing perhaps Bass's laughter might be at his expense, Epps presses.
EPPS Then share what's funny.
EPPS Or what ills you.
BASS I'm here to complete the work at hand.
BASS As requested, and as paid.
EPPS Something rubs you wrongly.
EPPS Before I take further offense, I offer you the opportunity to speak on it.
BASS You ask plainly, I will tell you plainly.
BASS What I find amusing: You worry about my well being in the heat but, quite frankly, the condition of your laborers--
EPPS "The condition of my..."
EPPS What in the hell are you--
BASS It is horrid.
BASS It's all wrong.
BASS All wrong, sir.
EPPS They ain't hired help.
EPPS They're my slaves.
BASS You say that with pride.
EPPS I say it as fact.
BASS If the conversation concerns what is factual and what is not; there's no justice nor righteousness in slavery.
BASS I wouldn't own a slave if I was rich as Croesus, which I am not, as is perfectly well understood.
BASS More particularly among my creditors.
BASS There's another humbug: the credit system.
BASS Humbug, sir.
BASS No credit, no debt.
BASS Credit leads a man into temptation.
BASS Cash down is the only thing that will deliver him from
B155 CONTINUED: (3) B155
BASS (CONT'D) evil.
BASS (CONT'D) But this question of slavery; what right have you to your niggers when you come down to the point?
EPPS What right?
EPPS I bought 'em.
EPPS I paid for 'em.
BASS Of course you did.
BASS The law says you have the right to hold a nigger, but begging the law's pardon...it lies.
BASS Is everything right because the law allows it?
BASS Suppose they'd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave?
EPPS Ha!
BASS Suppose.
EPPS That ain't a supposable case.
BASS Because the law states that your liberties are undeniable?
BASS Because society deems it so?
BASS Laws change.
BASS Social systems crumble.
BASS Universal truths are constant.
BASS It is a fact, it is a plain fact that what is true and right is true and right for all.
BASS White and black alike.
EPPS Whoa, whoa, whoa.
EPPS Yah compare me to a nigger, Bass?
EPPS Yah might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon.
EPPS Now, I seen one of them critters in Orleans that knowed just as much as any nigger I got.
EPPS Yah'd call them fellers citizens, I s'pose?
BASS Look here; you can't laugh me down in that way.
BASS These niggers are human beings.
BASS If they are allowed to scale no higher than brute animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it.
BASS There's an
B155 CONTINUED: (4) B155
EPPS Ahhh!
BASS A fearful ill, resting on this
EPPS You betray yourself a foreigner!
BASS That will not go unpunished forever.
BASS There will be a reckoning yet.
EPPS You like to hear yourself talk, Bass, better than any man I know of.
EPPS Yah'd argue that black was white, or white black if anybody would contradict you.
EPPS A fine supposition if yah lived among Yankees in New England.
EPPS But yah don't.
You most assuredly do not.
It's the Sabbath.
The slaves are left to themselves to do their own chores.
At the moment the female slaves are washing their clothes in large cauldrons, slapping their clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry near to their living quarters behind the plantation.
It is a sight of ritual.
Missing from the field of labor is Patsey, for whom Epps hollers.
EPPS Patsey...
EPPS Patsey!
A drunk Epps asks of the slaves:
EPPS (CONT'D) Where is she?
EPPS (CONT'D) Where is Patsey?
EPPS (CONT'D) No one answers.
EPPS (CONT'D) Talk, Damn you!
We know nothin' of her, Massa.
EPPS The hell you don't!
EPPS You know where she is!
EPPS She run off, ain't she?
EPPS She's escaped, and you miserable black dogs stand like
EPPS (CONT'D) the deef and dumb.
EPPS (CONT'D) Speak!
EPPS (CONT'D) Speak!
EPPS (CONT'D) Not a word spoken.
EPPS (CONT'D) My best cotton picking nigger!
EPPS (CONT'D) My best.
EPPS (CONT'D) A beat.
EPPS (CONT'D) I'd give yah all up for her.
EPPS (CONT'D) Where she gone?
EPPS (CONT'D) The slaves say nothing.
EPPS (CONT'D) There is nothing for them to say.
EPPS (CONT'D) They don't know where she is.
EPPS (CONT'D) Eventually Epps drops into true sorrow.
EPPS (CONT'D) She gone...
EPPS (CONT'D) My Pats gone.
EPPS'S PLANTATION - LATER Epps sits on the piazza looking quite forlorn.
EPPS'S PLANTATION - LATER He looks up only to see PATSEY RETURNING TO THE PLANTATION.
EPPS'S PLANTATION - LATER Epps steps up to greet her, with anger rather than relief.
EPPS'S PLANTATION - LATER As they hear his angry voice, the slaves step around from where they are hanging their laundry to dry.
EPPS'S PLANTATION - LATER Treach is near as well.
EPPS Run off.
EPPS Run off, did you?
EPPS You miserable wench!
EPPS Where you been?
PATSEY I been nowhere.
EPPS Lies to your misdeeds!
PATSEY The Sabbath day, Massa.
PATSEY I took me a walk to commune wit da Lord.
EPPS Bring the Lord into yer deceptions?
EPPS Yah Godless...
EPPS Shaw's.
EPPS Comin' from Shaw's plantation weren't yah?
PATSEY ...No...
EPPS Yah took yerself ta pleasure Shaw.
EPPS Yah gave baser passion to that unblushin' libertine!
Solomon tries to intervene:
EPPS Now yah speak?
EPPS Now that yah want to add to 'er lies yah find yer tongue.
EPPS Epps goes to strike Solomon, but Patsey pulls his arm back.
PATSEY Do not strike him.
PATSEY I went to Massa Shaw's plantation!
EPPS Yah admit it.
PATSEY Freely.
PATSEY And you know why.
PATSEY Patsey takes soap from the pocket of her dress.
PATSEY (CONT'D) I got this from Mistress Shaw.
PATSEY (CONT'D) Mistress Epps won't even grant me no soap ta clean with.
PATSEY (CONT'D) Stink so much I make myself gag.
PATSEY (CONT'D) Five hundred pounds 'a cotton day in, day out.
PATSEY (CONT'D) More than any man here.
PATSEY (CONT'D) And 'fo that I will be clean; that all I ax.
PATSEY (CONT'D) Dis here what I went to Shaw's 'fo.
EPPS You lie...
PATSEY The Lord knows that's all.
EPPS You lie!
PATSEY And you blind wit yer own covetousness.
PATSEY I don't lie, Massa.
PATSEY If you kill me, I'll stick ta that.
EPPS I'll learn you to go to Shaw's.
EPPS Treach, go get some line.
Treach runs quickly to the tool shed.
In short order he returns with the rope in hand.
EPPS (CONT'D) Strip her.
EPPS (CONT'D) Strike her bare 'n lash her to the post.
EPPS (CONT'D) Mistress Epps has now come from the Great House.
EPPS (CONT'D) She gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction.
EPPS (CONT'D) Now tied to the post, Epps stands behind Patsey with his whip.
EPPS (CONT'D) Yah done this to yerself, Pats!
EPPS (CONT'D) Epps hoists the whip to strike, holds it high...but no matter his rage, Epps cannot bring himself to deliver the blow.
EPPS (CONT'D) He looks to Mistress Epps who now stands gloating and spurring him on.
MISTRESS EPPS Do it!
MISTRESS EPPS Strike the life from her.
MISTRESS EPPS Epps again hoists the whip.
MISTRESS EPPS It trembles in his hand ahead of the act...
MISTRESS EPPS But he does not have it in him to deliver such a beating.
MISTRESS EPPS Turning to Solomon, thrusting
the whip at him:
EPPS Beat her.
EPPS Solomon doesn't move.
EPPS Epps shoves the whip into his hand.
EPPS (CONT'D) Give her the whip.
EPPS (CONT'D) Give it all to her!
Patsey, begging to Solomon:
PATSEY I'd rather it you, Platt.
EPPS Strike her, or yah'll get the same!
Solomon takes a step back.
He unfurls the whip...
He begins to whip Patsey.
Lash after lash, Patsey squirms before it.
Epps eyes fill with tears, he is nearly too distraught to watch.
But the Mistress...
She is not satisfied with Solomon's half-hearted effort.
MISTRESS EPPS He pantomimes.
MISTRESS EPPS There ain't barely a welt on her.
MISTRESS EPPS That's what your niggers make of yah; a fool fer the takin'.
MISTRESS EPPS Epps's grief is replaced by fury.
MISTRESS EPPS EPPS GRABS THE PISTOL FROM TREACH'S HOLSTER and draws down on the slaves.
EPPS Yah will strike her.
EPPS Yah will strike her until her flesh is rent and meat and blood flow equal, or I will kill every nigger in my sight!
EPPS Solomon can't strike a blow, even if it means his life.
But from the ground, from Patsey:
PATSEY Do it, Platt.
PATSEY Don't stop until I am dead.
PATSEY What else can he do?
PATSEY Solomon begins to whip, to truly whip Patsey.
PATSEY Her back welts, then tears...
PATSEY Patsey screams in agony.
PATSEY Solomon strikes again and again...
PATSEY After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is not satisfied.
EPPS Until I say no more!
EPPS I ain't said nothing!
EPPS Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times.
EPPS By now, as promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE
Finally, Solomon holds low the whip.
He can and will do no more.
EPPS (CONT'D) Strike her!
EPPS (CONT'D) Strike her!
EPPS (CONT'D) Solomon will not.
EPPS (CONT'D) Epps takes up the whip and whips Patsey with "ten fold" greater force than he had.
EPPS (CONT'D) The painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air.
EPPS (CONT'D) Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed.
EPPS (CONT'D) The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the ground.
EPPS (CONT'D) At length Patsey ceases struggling.
EPPS (CONT'D) Her head sinks listlessly on the ground.
Her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die away into a low moan.
It would seem that she was dying.
Solomon, screaming at Epps:
SOLOMON Thou devil!
SOLOMON Sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin!
SOLOMON Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats.
EPPS No sin!
EPPS There is no sin!
EPPS A man does how he pleases with his property.
EPPS At the moment, Platt, I am of great pleasure.
EPPS You be goddamn careful I don't come to wantin' to lightenin' my mood no further.
EPPS By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in the warm sunlight.
EPPS The birds chirp merrily amidst the foliage of the tress.
EPPS Peace and happiness seems to reign everywhere.
EPPS Everywhere else.
EPPS Epps leaves Patsey to herself.
EPPS He says not a word to the Mistress as he passes.
EPPS The Mistress herself heads back into the house.
EPPS Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the cabin.
Patsey is laid on some boards where she remains for a long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony.
Phebe applies melted tallow to her wounds, and all try to assist and console her.
In time Patsey opens her eyes.
She looks to Solomon.
She does not say a word.
She just looks at him...and then her eyes close again.
Solomon and Bass are working together alone on the extension.
From the amount of work that's been done on it, it should be obvious that days have now passed.
Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass.
As casually as he can he inquires:
SOLOMON Master Bass, I want to ask you what part of the country you came from?
BASS No part of this land.
BASS I was born in Canada.
BASS Now guess where that is.
SOLOMON Oh, I know where Canada is.
SOLOMON I have been there myself.
BASS Have you?
SOLOMON Montreal and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places.
SOLOMON And I have been in York state, too.
SOLOMON Buffalo and Rochester and Albany, and can tell you the names of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain canal.
SOLOMON Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare.
BASS Well traveled for a slave.
BASS How came you here?
SOLOMON Master Bass, if justice had been done I never would have been here.
BASS How's this?
BASS Tell me all about it.
SOLOMON I am afraid to tell you, though I don't believe you would tell Master Epps if I should.
BASS Every word you speak is a profound secret.
Solomon holds a moment.
Hasn't he heard the same promise before?
Prior to Solomon stating his case, WE FADE TO:
Hours have passed.
Bass reflects on the story that Epps has told in the intervening.
BASS How many years all told?
SOLOMON Just nearly...just passed eleven.
BASS Your story is...it is amazing, and in no good way.
SOLOMON Do you believe, sir, in justice as you have said?
BASS I do.
SOLOMON That slavery is an evil that should befall none?
BASS I believe so.
SOLOMON If you truly do, I would ask...I would beg that you write my friends in the north, acquainting them with my situation and beseeching them to forward free papers, or take such steps as they might consider proper to secure my release.
SOLOMON Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a prolonged beat.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) My daughter Margaret is possibly now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) I miss them so.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) It would be an unspeakable happiness to clasp my wife and my family again.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the conversation by work.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) They both lift it toward the floorboards.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Finally Bass speaks.
BASS I have always forgone relationships and family.
BASS I did once have a sweetheart who I loved deeply.
BASS Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon immediately hands over.
BASS (CONT'D) But that was a long, long time ago.
BASS (CONT'D) I've been traveling this country for the best part of twenty years.
BASS (CONT'D) My freedom is everything.
BASS (CONT'D) The fact that I can walk out of here tomorrow gives me most pleasure.
BASS (CONT'D) I see the aching in your eyes, the pain of not being attached to your loved ones.
BASS (CONT'D) My life doesn't mean much to anyone, but it seems your life means a lot to a lot of people.
BASS (CONT'D) What you have just said to me scares me, and I must say, sir, I am afraid.
BASS (CONT'D) Not just for you, but for me.
BASS (CONT'D) They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison.
BASS (CONT'D) Solomon, slightly confused.
BASS (CONT'D) I will write your letter sir, for if I could bring freedom to you, it will be more than a pleasure.
BASS (CONT'D) It will be a duty.
BASS (CONT'D) Now, would you be so kind as to pass me those nails, sir.
BASS (CONT'D) We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the unfinished structure.
BASS (CONT'D) They continue to work, as if the conversation had never occurred.
A165 EXT.
SWAMP TBD A165
Solomon walks a path he has walked a thousand times or more on his way back from Bartholomew's - sack familiarly slung over his right shoulder.
Drearily he walks.
His eyes acknowledge something we yet cannot see to his left.
Almost simultaneously, his eyes retract back to the path
A165 CONTINUED: A165 towards Epps'.
As he passes out of shot, the evidence of what he was looking at is revealed.
FEET hang at the top right hand corner of the frame.
A woman, who has been lynched.
To a now virtually complete, half-painted white gazebo.
Slaves continue to work on it.
As they do so, Bass peels away from the structure to have an overview.
He beckons Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who are continuing to work on the gazebo.
As Solomon approaches, Bass shouts-
BASS And bring those markers!
BASS Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and approaches Bass.
BASS (CONT'D) No letter yet.
SOLOMON You are certain?
SOLOMON Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the earth.
BASS I have inquired thoroughly.
BASS More than is safe for either of us.
BASS Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground, improvising a pathway towards the gazebo.
BASS (CONT'D) Solomon...I have a job or two on hand which will be completed shortly...
BASS (CONT'D) The work here has grown sparse.
Bass doesn't need to spell things out for Solomon.
Solomon's understanding of the finality of the situation should be very clear.
BASS (CONT'D) You must know, wherever I am I will press your cause.
SOLOMON Five months.
SOLOMON On top of these years.
SOLOMON No cause remains.
BASS If there is any chance...
SOLOMON Mr. Bass...
BASS I will continue to write your
SOLOMON Go home knowing you have tried.
SOLOMON The weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both men.
SOLOMON Nothing more to do, nothing more to say BASS TAKES
SURREPTITIOUSLY knowing full well he cannot be seen making contact with a slave.
But in the strength of their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon.
Equally, we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass.
The moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither man can openly speak his regret or thanks.
A moment longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.
Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone.
A168 EXT.
ROAD BY EPPS' PLANTATION - EVENING A168
Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in hand.
He stares across the expanse.
His eyes fixed on something that is a million miles away.
Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg tighter and tighter.
As the strings are taut, the sound is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as if bones are being cracked one by one.
Just beyond the breaking point of sound, there is a snap.
He then repeats the action.
Solomon holds the neck of the violin.
Sliding his thumb and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it at the base.
He carefully snaps the neck and removes it from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the ground.
He then starts on the body.
Heaving it on the ground, it falls apart.
Methodically he breaks the violin into small bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of violence, rather than aggressive.
Seems almost to be, in an odd way, respectful.
The Slaves are sewing the heavily plowed field, making their way in the trying soil.
Solomon, too focused to note the arrival of two men by carriage: Parker and the
While the Sheriff makes his way to the field, Parker remains with the carriage.
The Sheriff calls:
SHERIFF Platt...?
SHERIFF Where is the boy called Platt?
SOLOMON ...Sir...
SOLOMON The Sheriff crosses to him.
SHERIFF Your name is Platt, is it?
SOLOMON Yes, sir.
SOLOMON Pointing off to the distance.
SHERIFF Do you know that man?
Solomon looks toward the carriage.
He has to shield his eyes from the sun.
Recognition is slow coming to him.
But when it does, it hits him as a rush.
SOLOMON Mr. Parker...?
Solomon starts for Parker, but he is pulled back by the Sheriff who is keen to determine Solomon's true identity.
SHERIFF Say again?
SOLOMON Mr. Parker?
SOLOMON As he does, Epps makes his way over.
SHERIFF That man received a letter compiling many accusations.
SHERIFF You look me in the eye and on your life answer me truthfully: have you any other name than Platt?
SOLOMON Solomon Northup is my name.
EPPS Sheriff...
SHERIFF Have you a family?
EPPS What's all this?
SHERIFF It's official business.
EPPS My nigger, my business.
SHERIFF Your business waits.
Tell me of your family.
SOLOMON I have a wife and two children.
SHERIFF What were your children's names?
SOLOMON Margaret and Alonzo.
SHERIFF And your wife's name before her marriage?
SOLOMON Anne Hampton.
SOLOMON I am who I say.
SOLOMON Solomon pushes past the sheriff.
SOLOMON As Solomon moves toward Parker, his pace quickens with each step until his
168 CONTINUED: (3) 168 personal velocity has him nearly at a dead run.
The two old friends make contact with each other, wrap each other in a long and emotional embrace.
It if finally broken by Epps, who has moved over with the Sheriff.
EPPS Nah...
EPPS You will unhand 'em.
EPPS Platt is my nigger!
PARKER He is Solomon Northup.
EPPS You say...
PARKER He belongs to no man.
EPPS You say!
EPPS You come here, unfamiliar to me, and make claims.
SHERIFF Not claims.
SHERIFF I have no doubts.
SHERIFF This is Solomon Northup, a resident of Saratoga Springs, NY.
EPPS To hell with that!
EPPS My nigger, and I'll fight you for 'em!
PARKER As is your right.
PARKER As it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you in the courts.
PARKER Your decision.
PARKER By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered in the yard as witnesses.
PARKER They stand behind the cabin, out of sight of Epps.
PARKER Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda next to her house slave.
PARKER Her face is of a strange mixed emotion.
PARKER Epps looks to Solomon.
PARKER Solomon icily, stoically holds his ground.
PARKER He makes it quite clear in his countenance that nobody owns him.
PARKER Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there to back Solomon up.
PARKER Epps, with no other recourse than to
EPPS You think this is the last you'll see of me, boy?
EPPS It ain't.
Whatever paper you hold about his freedom, it don't mean naught.
He is my nigger - and I will have my day in court, sir.
As God as my witness, I will have my day in court.
Take 'em!
Epps calls to Bob-
EPPS (CONT'D) Saddle my horse!
EPPS (CONT'D) And bring her up here.
EPPS (CONT'D) Epps walks back into the plantation.
EPPS (CONT'D) The trio starts for the carriage.
EPPS (CONT'D) Solomon is pulled back
by the call of Patsey's voice:
PATSEY Platt...
PATSEY Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey.
PATSEY Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to engage.
PATSEY Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around Solomon and they embrace.
PATSEY Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter.
PATSEY Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he rides off furiously.
Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps:
PARKER Solomon...if we know what's wise, we should depart.
PARKER A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other.
PARKER They separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage.
PARKER He and Parker alight.
PARKER The Sheriff chides the horses and they
168 CONTINUED: (6) 168 start up.
As they move on, Patsey sinks down to the ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining state, the other slaves around her.
WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further from the slaves - who are diminished by distance.
Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes forever more.
We now see Solomon in front of a door.
A door we have seen before at the very beginning of our story.
Solomon, aged significantly since then, stands nervously, swallowing, and adjusting his attire.
He breaths in and holds his breath.
He blows out and closes his eyes.
A tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he wants his family to see him.
He gathers himself, and looks to his right.
There stands Mr. Parker.
He places his hand on Solomon's shoulder.
He says gently-
PARKER Are you ready?
PARKER Solomon swallows and nods.
THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS.
Mr. Parker enters, Solomon behind.
We first see Anne, in her finest attire; the Northup children: Alonzo, who is now seventeen and Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A BUNDLE.
Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND.
The family waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.
Anne rises to greet him, but holds back.
All around, the body language of the family is stiff and awkward.
They are, after all - after twelve years - little more than familiar strangers.
SOLOMON I apologize for my appearance.
SOLOMON I have had a difficult time of things these past many years.
SOLOMON Solomon looks among his family; trying to recall them as much as they look to see familiarity within him.
SOLOMON To his
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Alonzo...
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Margaret, yes?
SOLOMON (CONT'D) You do not recognize me, do you?
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Do
SOLOMON (CONT'D) you...do you even remember the last time we saw each other?
SOLOMON (CONT'D) I put you on a carriage with your mother...
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Margaret, tearing, hugs her father.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Solomon almost breaks, but he keeps himself together.
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Looking to the
SOLOMON (CONT'D) And who is this?
MARGARET He is my husband.
SOLOMON Husband?
It is very good to meet you, sir.
SOLOMON We have much acquainting to do.
SOLOMON Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father.
MARGARET And this is your grandson.
MARGARET Solomon Northup Staunton.
SOLOMON ...Solomon...
SOLOMON The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming.
SOLOMON Solomon breaks down.
SOLOMON Emotionally, physically...
SOLOMON But ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM.
SOLOMON As she holds him, Solomon
says to Anne with all his heart:
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Forgive me.
ANNE There is nothing to forgive.
ANNE The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each other for life...and one would think for all the rest of their lives.
Upon gaining his freedom, Solomon Northup located and attempted to seek legal justice against the men who kidnapped him.
The case was tried in Washington, DC where blacks were prohibited by law from testifying
169 CONTINUED: (2) 169 against whites.
The charges against the kidnappers were eventually dismissed.
Northup spent the rest of his life working as an abolitionist, and with the Underground Railroad.
Solomon Northup most likely died between 1863 and 1875.
The exact date, place, and circumstances of his death remain unknown.
