First Draft February 2, 2007
It's New Year's Eve at Rudy's, a hole-in-the-wall dive.
People stream into the bar to celebrate.
Outside, CARL KENDALL (30s) and his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend KATH are having a quiet intense discussion.
KATH You don't do anything more.
KATH You used to be fun.
KATH Now you hardly ever even leave your apartment.
CARL I'm here, aren't I?
KATH That's because it's New Year's Eve.
KATH You have to be here.
KATH Besides, it's not only social stuff.
KATH You used to have dreams.
KATH You wanted to go to business school, you wanted to work for the World Bank.
CARL So I discovered b-school's not for me.
CARL People grow.
KATH Growing is "X is not for me so I'll do Y."
KATH You went X is not for me and so I guess I'll sit on the couch for the rest of my life.
CARL Well, look, this sucks, but I understand where you're coming from.
KATH This is the problem.
KATH You don't even care that I'm breaking up with you.
CARL Of course I care.
CARL But I also understand.
KATH You shouldn't just understand.
KATH You should be mad.
KATH Or upset.
KATH Or sad.
KATH Or something.
CARL We're at different places in our lives.
CARL I get it.
KATH Your girlfriend of two years breaks up with you right before New Year's Eve and all you can say is "I get it?" It is completely within your right to call me a bitch.
CARL That would be inappropriate.
KATH I can't believe I've been dating someone so emotionless.
CARL C'mere.
CARL It'll be OK.
Carl hugs her.
Rudy's is a dive bar.
Dartboard, pool table, scuffed wooden floors, Miller Lite sign, etc.
The patrons are all FACING THE GIANT TELEVISION.
The New Year's Ball is DROPPING.
Among the patrons is our hero Carl, his best friend PETER, Peter's girlfriend LUCY, their party friend ROONEY and his ex- girlfriend, Kath who's still a little red-eyed.
PATRONS Three, two, one...
PATRONS happy New Year!
Everyone BLOWS NOISEMAKERS and POPS CHAMPAGNE.
PATRONS (cont'd) Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind?
PATRONS (cont'd) Should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of auld lang syne?
CARL Well, that was fantastic.
CARL Good night, guys.
PETER You're going, already?
KATH We haven't even finished the song yet.
CARL I saw the ball drop and hugged all of you.
CARL Aliens didn't invade.
CARL Our computers are still working.
CARL What else could possibly happen?
LUCY Rooney might throw up.
ROONEY It's true.
ROONEY I'm very close.
CARL I see that happen like every night.
CARL Good night and Happy New Year.
Carl leaves.
His friends look concerned.
LUCY How did he take the break-up?
KATH Like a robot.
KATH Two years, and nothing.
LUCY I'm so sorry.
Carl goes into his apartment.
He lies down in his bed and closes his eyes.
CLOSE ON THE ALARM.
His alarm goes off.
Carl HITS IT off.
It's now DAYTIME.
Carl gets dressed.
He puts on a nametag for Southwest Bank.
Carl walks down the street, fast.
He passes a CUTE GIRL who's name we'll learn is RENEE passing out flyers for a band called "The Flying Buttresses."
RENEE Wanna rock out tonight?
CARL I don't rock out.
He walks into Dunkin Donuts.
The Dunkin Donuts Cashier hands Carl his coffee.
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Would you like an Italian-inspired coffee flavoring?
CARL No thanks.
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER How about the double doughnut special?
CARL No.
Carl sits at his cubicle, flips on his email.
CARL Dear Trusted Foreigner, Allow me to introduce myself.
CARL I am the deposed King of Nigeria and I wish to propose a confidential transaction.
CARL Allow me to delete you, my liege.
NORMAN, his needy boss, comes up to him.
NORMAN My teller reporting for duty.
CARL I'm not a soldier.
NORMAN You're a soldier on the front line of finance.
NORMAN (cont'd) So, Carl, I'm having a party this Friday.
NORMAN (cont'd) It's a funny hat party.
NORMAN (cont'd) May I entreat you to come?
Carl looks at his calendar.
It's totally empty.
CARL I'm out of town.
Carl stands in the middle of the floor staring into the middle distance.
A CUSTOMER approaches him.
BANK CUSTOMER Hey, I need to speak to a loan specialist and there's no one on the floor.
CARL Sorry.
CARL Today I'm officially a greeter.
Beat.
BANK CUSTOMER But there's no one around.
CARL Someone might come.
CARL And if I'm not here, they won't be greeted.
BANK CUSTOMER You're really not going to help me?
CARL Until I'm relieved as a greeter, my hands are tied.
The Bank Customer sits down in the sectioned off waiting area as Carl stands in the middle of the floor.
It is very awkward.
No one comes in.
Carl slowly moves so a column blocks the customer's view of him.
Now that Carl's behind the column, he has a clear view of the entrance of the bank.
Through the floor to ceiling windows, he sees the handsome NEW PRESIDENT OF SOUTHWEST BANK, CHRIS PARKER, tear up in a Mercedes.
He steps out of the Mercedes with a hot girl on his arm.
He and the girl walk into the bank.
Carl stares at them, jealously.
CHRIS PARKER Hey, there.
CHRIS PARKER I'm Chris Parker.
CHRIS PARKER The new president of Southwest Bank.
CHRIS PARKER Just wanted to come by and personally introduce myself to every branch manager.
NORMAN That would be me.
NORMAN Norman Calhoun.
Chris turns to Carl.
CARL I'm Carl Kendall.
CARL Just a teller.
CHRIS PARKER I was "just a teller."
CHRIS PARKER And now I'm "just president of the largest bank in the Southwest."
CHRIS PARKER You need anything, you let corporate know.
CHRIS PARKER You hear?
NORMAN Definitely.
Chris Parker and his HOT SECRETARY leaves.
Carl watches them, clearly jealous.
NORMAN (cont'd) Nice work if you can get it.
NORMAN (cont'd) Am I right?
CARL Yeah, if you're into fake breasts and German engineering.
NORMAN Check and check.
The Bank Customer comes around.
BANK CUSTOMER Can you help me now?
CARL No, but this gentleman can.
Carl indicates Norman.
Norman goes to help the customer.
Carl stares up at the clock.
The clock finally CLICKS TO
NORMAN Think about my party, Carl!
CARL Will do!
Carl microwaves a Lean Cuisine.
Carl watches Survivor while eating Lean Cuisine.
Carl lays down and closes his eyes.
The alarm GOES OFF again.
PULL BACK to reveal it's morning.
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Would you like an Italian --
CARL No thanks.
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER How about --
CARL No.
Carl ignores the girl handing out fliers.
NORMAN Valentine party.
NORMAN Just wear something red!
CARL Can't.
Carl stares as the clock clicks to 5:00.
He's out the door.
Carl warms up a frozen pizza.
Carl eats the frozen pizza and watches Big Brother.
Carl lies down.
The alarm FLIPS ON.
CARL No.
-- ON THE STREET.
Carl refuses the pamphlet.
NORMAN Dress as your favorite animal --
CARL Sorry.
Carl eats frozen lasagna while watching The Amazing Race.
NORMAN -- historical figure --
CARL No can do.
-- CARL AT HOME EATING FROZEN MEATLOAF AND WATCHING Project Runway.
It's now just a blur of images of Carl at Southwest Bank, shaking his head `no', eating Lean Cuisine and watching reality television.
Carl's lying on his bed.
The phone is ringing.
He gets up and answers.
CARL Hello?
PETER (V.O.) Carl.
PETER (V.O.) It's Peter.
PETER (V.O.) Where are you?
CARL I'm in bed.
CARL Why?
CARL What happened?
CARL Did someone die?
PETER (V.O.) No.
PETER (V.O.) It's just -- we're at Rudy's.
PETER (V.O.) Celebrating New Year's.
Carl looks at the alarm.
It's 11:15 PM.
CARL It's already 11:15.
CARL I don't think I can make it.
PETER Oh, c'mon, Carl.
PETER No one's seen you for like forever.
PETER Please swing by?
CARL No.
CARL (cont'd) Tell everyone Happy New Year.
Carl lies down and hangs up the phone.
Carl watches his alarm clock FLIP TO 12:00AM.
He closes his eyes and goes to sleep.
Carl's eating lunch at a picnic table outside.
Several bank employees smoke cigarettes near him.
An oddly hyper guy named ALEX approaches Carl.
ALEX Carl Kendall?
CARL Alex Eberts?
CARL What's up, buddy?
Alex hugs Carl.
ALEX Too much!
ALEX How've you been?
ALEX I can't believe you're still working here.
CARL Where've you been?
CARL Norman's been heartbroken since you quit.
ALEX Where've I been?
ALEX You mean, where haven't I been?
ALEX This year.
ALEX Dude.
ALEX I have lived.
ALEX I climbed Mt.
ALEX Kilmanjaro.
ALEX I ate bat in Laos.
ALEX I shot a cow with a bazooka.
ALEX I'm not proud of that last one but I did it.
ALEX How's the bank?
CARL Same old same old.
ALEX See?
ALEX That's the problem.
ALEX That's everyone's problem.
ALEX You've got one life.
ALEX Why waste it on the same old same old?
Alex hands Carl a pamphlet for a "Just Say Yes" seminar.
ALEX (cont'd) I know this will sound queer, but you have to hit this seminar.
ALEX (cont'd) It changed my life.
ALEX (cont'd) It will change yours.
ALEX (cont'd) Unless you like the bank.
CARL You kidding?
CARL Every day it's impossible not to throw rocks at the place.
CARL Since you don't work here anymore, you want to throw a couple?
ALEX Yes.
Alex starts WHIPPING rocks at the bank.
CARL What're you doing!
CARL Stop that!
CARL I was kidding!
Norman comes out.
NORMAN What do you think you're doing?
NORMAN Alex Eberts!
NORMAN Is this an alumnae prank?
NORMAN I love pranks!
ALEX Hey, Norman!
Alex continues throwing rocks at the bank.
NORMAN We have a situation.
A couple portly security guards come out and wrestle Alex to the ground.
He manages to escape and run from the bank.
ALEX Go to the seminar, Carl!
ALEX You won't be sorry!
Carl walks into his apartment.
He hits PLAY on his answering machine.
PETER (V.O.) (over the answering
MACHINE) Carl, it's Peter.
MACHINE) I know you don't do things anymore, but it'd mean a lot if you'd come by Rudy's tonight.
MACHINE) Lucy and I are celebrating our engagement.
Carl's watching Hell's Kitchen and eating a frozen pizza.
There's a knock on the door.
The "Just Say Yes" pamphlet balled up on his desk.
He's using it as a napkin.
Carl PAUSES the television show.
He stands up and opens the door.
Peter STUMBLES IN.
CARL What are you doing here?
PETER This is an intervention.
PETER You've missed your last event.
CARL What're you talking about?
PETER Our engagement party.
CARL I'm sorry.
CARL I'm just really busy.
You're watching Hell's Kitchen.
That's not even B-list reality TV.
So I don't want to go out tonight.
Maybe I have to wake up early tomorrow.
You don't know.
It's bigger than that.
You and Kath broke up over a year ago and you still aren't dating anyone.
What?
So?
I'm like a sexual camel.
I only need it once every couple years.
I don't mean to be harsh but everyone's moving forward.
It's like you're still wearing a Timex while the rest of us each have entry level Rolexes.
You wear a Rolex?
Thanks for noticing.
It's an Oyster Perpetual Yachtmaster.
Sapphire crystal, self-winding.
Four Gs.
But that's not the point I'm trying to make.
So I don't have an oyster watch.
All you and Lucy and Kath do is sit around and talk about real estate and Crate and Barrel.
What's wrong with Crate and Barrel?
They have adorable stuff at reasonable prices.
Forget Crate and Barrel.
Maybe I'm just getting more mature.
I don't need the lifestyle ever night.
Lifestyle?
You have to have a life to have a style of life.
You never leave your apartment.
You never meet anyone new.
I hate meeting people.
You've become a complete cave dweller.
I am not a cave dweller.
Just the other day, we all went to Summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me I wouldn't steal something and so I stole a drumstick from that horrible Swedish hillbilly band.
That's not very cave dweller of me.
Just the other day?
That was seven years ago.
But that's not possible -- I was already working at the bank by then.
You had started there three years earlier.
Why you've worked at that place for so long is beyond me.
You had so much potential.
You shouldn't be a teller.
You should be the guy who tells the guy who tells the teller what to do.
I've been a teller at Southwest Bank for ten years?
How the hell did that happen?
Ten years...
if I had had a child, he'd be toilet-trained by now.
Actually, he'd be in fourth grade.
CARL I was making out with chicks by fourth grade.
CARL I was a little man by fourth grade.
CARL Whatever.
CARL I don't need this shit right now.
CARL I'm an adult man.
CARL I can live my life as I see fit.
CARL Can you please leave?
Carl pushes Peter out the door.
Carl sits down on the couch.
He then unballs the "Just Say Yes" pamphlet.
It features an Indian man smiling beatifically.
A banner across a stage that has a photo of the same Indian man smiling beatifically.
We PAN DOWN to find Carl among the crowd.
Carl sits down next to a WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN.
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN Is this your first time at one of Sanji's lectures?
CARL Uh, yeah.
CARL Have you been to this before?
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN Only like fifty-eight times.
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN Sanji's a genius.
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN Like seriously...
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN he will blow your mind all over the goddamn room.
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN He's like a mind grenade.
CARL I don't know if I want that.
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN Oh you do not.
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN But you need it.
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN And that's why you are here.
CARL Cool.
CARL Do you want anything from the refreshment area?
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN You kidding?
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN That processed shit will kill you faster than a pleasure cruise to Chernobyl.
Carl heads over to the refreshment table.
Once he's out of her sight, he sits down alone in a corner of the conference room.
Ethereal music begins to play over the loudspeakers.
People begin to sit.
Carl sits down in the back.
SANJI (V.O.) Life.
SANJI (V.O.) We are all living it.
Carl laughs.
No one else does.
The lights get rosier.
SANJI (V.O.)
(cont'd) Or are we?
Change doesn't start on the surface.
It's generated from consciousness.
But where is consciousness generated from?
Carl looks around.
Everyone is nodding along with it.
SANJI (cont'd) From the external.
SANJI (cont'd) And the external is manipulated through our choices.
SANJI (cont'd) And our choices start with one word.
The music ABRUPTLY SWITCHES to the opening beats of "Jump" by the Pointer Sisters.
The rosy colored lights FLIP TO BRIGHT WHITE and SWEEP ACROSS THE CONVENTION CENTER ROOM.
It is suddenly like a rock concert.
SANJI (50s) BUSTS THROUGH THE GIANT BANNER.
The whole crowd starts CHEERING.
SANJI (cont'd) Yes!
Instead of "Jump", Sanji's yelling "Yes!"
SANJI (cont'd) Say yes!
SANJI (cont'd) For your life!
SANJI (cont'd) Yes!
SANJI (cont'd) Change starts now!
SANJI (cont'd) Yes!
SANJI (cont'd) Yes!
SANJI (cont'd) Yes!
SANJI (cont'd) Say it with me!
SANJI (cont'd) SAY YES!
Sanji pumps his fist in the air as lame indoor fireworks GO OFF.
The crowd JUMPS ON THEIR FEET.
SANJI (cont'd) Are you ready to open the door to yes?
CROWD Yes!
SANJI I am sorry, my friends.
SANJI But I cannot hear you?
CROWD Yes!
SANJI Shhhhhhh.
The crowd quiets.
SANJI (cont'd) Now is the time when we must greet our new members.
SANJI (cont'd) Who here is new?
SANJI (cont'd) Please, do not be shy.
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN He is!
The woman POINTS AT Carl.
The spotlight SWINGS OVER to Carl.
He is annoyed.
SANJI Come on up, Future Yes Man!
CARL That's OK.
CARL I'm just auditing.
SANJI You can't audit life!
SANJI Now get on up here!
CARL I'm cool right here.
SANJI Then I will come to you!
Sanji runs off the stage and joins Carl in the back of the conference hall.
The spotlights follow him.
SANJI (cont'd) What is your name?
CARL Carl.
SANJI Let me guess, Carl.
SANJI This was not your idea to come here, Carl.
CARL I wouldn't say that.
SANJI You can tell me, Carl.
SANJI We are all alone, Carl.
The crowd laughs.
CARL It wasn't exactly my idea.
SANJI That's what I thought, Carl.
SANJI And you think this is all bullshit, Carl, isn't that right, Carl?
CARL Honestly?
SANJI Is there any other way?
CARL This whole thing seems retarded.
SANJI But you are stuck in your life, Carl?
SANJI Am I right?
CARL I wouldn't necessarily --
SANJI You once had a dream?
SANJI You wanted to own a boat?
SANJI A house?
SANJI A fancy car?
SANJI You wanted to a doctor, a lawyer...
SANJI a business man?
Carl nods, surprised at Sanji's incisiveness.
SANJI (cont'd) You wanted to be more than you are.
SANJI (cont'd) And yet you have suddenly woken up to find life is passing you by.
SANJI (cont'd) Am I right, Carl?
Sanji's suddenly getting to Carl.
As Sanji talks to him, the moment between them becomes more and more intimate.
It should feel like the rest of the crowd has disappeared.
CARL A little.
SANJI It's odd that ten years can pass just like that.
Sanji snaps.
SANJI (cont'd) Isn't it, Carl?
CARL It is.
SANJI I want you to do something for me, Carl.
SANJI Tomorrow, I want you only to say yes.
SANJI Can you do that for me?
SANJI For one day, Carl?
CARL I'm not sure --
SANJI Please, Carl.
SANJI Do it for me and you will be doing it for yourself.
SANJI If you don't have the best day in ten years then I am the uncle of a monkey.
SANJI Will you do it for me Carl?
SANJI Just for a day?
CARL Yes?
Sanji grabs Carl hand and PULLS HIM to his feet.
We PULL BACK and the crowd CHEERS.
SANJI Welcome to the world of yes!
Fireworks and confetti go off.
The Wiry, Anxious Woman Gives Carl a creepy thumbs up.
Carl's asleep.
The phone starts ringing.
Carl sleepily grabs the phone.
CARL Yello.
PETER (V.O.) Carl, it's Peter.
PETER (V.O.) I just wanted to apologize about barging in yesterday.
PETER (V.O.) You were right.
PETER (V.O.) It's your life to live.
CARL Don't worry about it.
PETER (V.O.) Me, Lucy and Kath are all going out for brunch.
PETER (V.O.) You have any interest in joining?
CARL Oh, thanks for the invite, but...
SANJI Will you do it for me Carl?
SANJI Just for a day?
BACK TO CARL AND PETER.
We CLOSE IN ON CARL'S MOUTH.
CARL Yes.
PETER Excuse me?
CARL Yes.
CARL I will come to brunch.
Stackers is a cutesie brunch place.
Carl walks up to Peter, Lucy and Kath.
KATH Morning, Carl.
KATH This is a surprise.
CARL Why?
KATH Because I've never seen you at brunch.
KATH Like ever.
CARL You kidding?
CARL I love brunch.
Carl, Peter, Lucy and Kath are still waiting with a big crowd of people to sit down for brunch.
CARL Why do people wait an hour for breakfast?
CARL It's so hot and bright and we haven't even had coffee yet.
PETER If you don't want to be here, you don't have to be.
CARL Of course I want to be here.
CARL I love waiting an hour for eggs.
CARL It's fun.
CARL Although I will point out that you have sunglasses which is probably making this wait a lot easier.
PETER Oakleys, polarized lenses, indestructible.
PETER Two fifty but worth every penny.
The Waitress comes up.
WAITRESS Lowell, party of five.
A group of four people get up to be seated.
CARL We were definitely before those Lowell people.
KATH I hate when people jump ahead.
CARL Why does no one ever say anything?
PETER If you want to be sitting so bad, why don't you say something?
CARL Yes.
CARL I will.
Carl walks up to the Waitress.
CARL (cont'd) Excuse me, but we were here before those people.
WAITRESS No you weren't.
CARL Yes, we were.
WAITRESS I have the list, dude.
WAITRESS The list doesn't lie.
Meanwhile, the customers the Waitress was going to seat are looking away, trying not to get involved.
CARL Well, this time the list lied.
LUCY It's OK, Carl.
LUCY It's just brunch.
CARL You all know that we were up before you!
CARL And you have to live with that knowledge through your delightful brunch!
Peter pulls Carl away from the Waitress.
PETER What's going on with you?
CARL I just want transparency in terms of the brunch seating order.
One of the customers who was being seated heads over.
KATH Great.
KATH Now we're going to get into a fight.
BRUNCH DUDE We talked about what you said...
BRUNCH DUDE you're right.
BRUNCH DUDE You guys were here before us.
BRUNCH DUDE Sorry we didn't pipe up sooner.
BRUNCH DUDE We cool, brother?
CARL Yeah.
CARL We cool.
Carl and the Brunch Dude punch fists and hug.
Carl and his friends are sitting at a table.
Carl's slightly bored as his friends discuss real estate.
LUCY It's a two bedroom duplex with harbor views.
LUCY It'd be perfect for you Kath.
KATH Washer/Dryer in the building?
CARL I didn't realize you were looking to buy a place.
CARL I thought you and I would be renters to the end.
PETER She's a fancy lawyer making bank.
PETER It's about time she was buying.
KATH Shut up.
The Brunch Dude is seated near Carl.
He gives him a thumbs up.
Carl gives a thumbs up right back.
PETER What're you looking at?
CARL Bacon and eggs.
KATH How unadventurous.
CARL I don't want an adventure first thing in the morning.
The Waitress comes over.
WAITRESS I just want to tell you about my specials.
WAITRESS We have a double fruit burnt sugar waffle.
WAITRESS Any of you interested in that?
Beat.
CARL Yes.
WAITRESS Alrighty.
WAITRESS Then, on the savory side, we have a smoked whitefish omelet with hash browns on the side.
WAITRESS Any takers?
Beat.
CARL Yes.
WAITRESS You want both?
CARL Yes.
The Waitress writes that down.
WAITRESS Would you like toast with that?
CARL Yes.
WAITRESS Any side?
WAITRESS Bacon.
CARL Yes.
WAITRESS Sausage.
CARL Yes.
WAITRESS Turkey sausage?
CARL Yes.
WAITRESS A side of our famous maple pancakes
CARL Yes.
WAITRESS Wow.
WAITRESS Someone's really hungry.
CARL Yes.
WAITRESS Coffee or juice?
CARL Coffee.
CARL And juice.
WAITRESS We also have smoothies?
CARL Yes.
Carl's friends look at him like a freak.
WAITRESS Is that all?
CARL Yes.
WAITRESS (turning towards his
FRIENDS) What would you all like to order?
His friends are all looking at Carl.
Carl has six dishes in front of him.
The Waitress comes over with a pepper mill.
WAITRESS Would you like some pepper?
CARL Yes.
The Waitress starts grinding pepper onto Carl's meal.
It's starting to take a long time.
She's grinding and grinding and grinding.
WAITRESS Would you like more?
CARL Yes.
She keeps grinding.
A pile of pepper's growing on his food.
All of Carl's food is covered piles of pepper.
PETER I don't think I've ever seen a waiter tap one of those pepper mills.
CARL I'm just addicted to the stuff.
CARL Chinese cultures say it's good for digestion.
CARL You're all welcome to have some.
LUCY That's...
LUCY OK.
LUCY Do you want a bite of mine?
CARL Yes.
Carl takes a bite of Lucy's.
He then sips his coffee.
CARL (cont'd) Uch.
CARL (cont'd) Brunch coffee.
CARL (cont'd) Why can't they make it black without all this frothy shit?
PETER Because you ordered a latte.
Carl's phone rings.
He answers it.
NORMAN Hey, Carl.
NORMAN We're a little short on our Saturday staff.
NORMAN I know this is going against ten years of precedent, but you have any interest in coming in today?
CARL I don't think...
CARL there's any reason why I shouldn't?
CARL On a Saturday there's nothing I like more than the inside of a bank.
NORMAN There really is something magical about this place.
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Would you like an Italian-inspired coffee flavoring?
Beat.
CARL Yes.
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Sugar, Splenda or Nutrasweet?
CARL All of them please.
The confused Dunkin Donuts cashier loads up Carl's coffee.
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER We're having a special on Munchkins?
Carl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a giant coffee and several boxes of Munchkins.
He walks by Renee, the cute girl who hands out band fliers.
RENEE Want a flier?
RENEE Oh, it's you.
RENEE Never mind.
CARL Of course I'll take a flier.
Carl takes a flier.
Renee's surprised Carl's taking a flier.
CARL (cont'd) The Flying Buttresses.
RENEE I knew after a year and a half of wearing you down, you'd give in.
RENEE I'm Renee by the way.
Renee holds out her hand.
CARL Carl.
RENEE Carl.
RENEE Cool.
RENEE I like to thank everyone personally who comes to our performances.
RENEE It gives it a nice intimate touch.
RENEE See you soon Carl.
Carl turns away, nervous that he's accepted her invitation.
He takes a sip of his giant coffee and grimaces.
Carl STUMBLES INTO work, hyper from the giant coffee.
NORMAN Morning, Carl.
NORMAN Thanks for coming in and being part of the Saturday banking experience.
NORMAN Oooh, Munchkins.
NORMAN Are those for the office, you dirty devil?
CARL Yeah.
CARL I just though it would be a fun way to lighten things up.
NORMAN You didn't approve this with petty cash.
CARL I spent my own money on them...
NORMAN Kidding!
NORMAN Munchkins are always approved.
NORMAN Although, I can't reimburse you.
NORMAN Today is free Munchkin day.
NORMAN That's right!
NORMAN Free Munchkin day!
Instantly Carl's cubicle is surrounded by fellow workers.
BANK EMPLOYEES Carl rules./You're the best./Finally I have a reason to live today.
Carl's greeting.
A MIDDLE-AGED MOTHERLY CUSTOMER comes in.
CARL How may I help you?
BANK CUSTOMER I need to speak to a loan specialist.
Beat.
CARL While loans aren't normally in my jurisdiction, I'd be happy to help you.
Carl's trying to keep up as the customer launches into intense finance-speak.
BANK CUSTOMER I want to refi my house and spend the capital on my personal business.
BANK CUSTOMER I see you've got a 5.25 7 year ARM, but over at Chase they're offering 5.00 7 year ARM.
BANK CUSTOMER Can you refi lower, like at 4.85 par example, or am I going to have to bring my beeswax elsewhere?
CARL Yes.
BANK CUSTOMER Yes?
BANK CUSTOMER That's it?
CARL Yup.
CARL What's your business?
BANK CUSTOMER Selling beanie babies online.
CARL Adorable.
BANK CUSTOMER More like highly profitable.
BANK CUSTOMER I've crunched the numbers.
The woman hands over a scrapbook that's been decorated with construction paper and pictures of beanie babies.
Carl opens the scrapbook.
It's filled with numbers.
CARL Let me just get final approval on this.
Carl gets up and walks over to Norman.
Carl stands before Norman.
NORMAN You're a teller, not a loan specialist.
CARL No, I know, so if you think this is a bad idea for a loan that's fine but can you please tell her yourself?
NORMAN What's this?
CARL Her business plan.
Norman grabs the business plan and starts reading it.
NORMAN Inta-maresting.
NORMAN My grandma loves beanie babies.
NORMAN Although unfortunately, we have a minimum loan floor of ten thousand dollars.
NORMAN She only wants five.
CARL That's silly.
CARL How're you supposed to start a tiny business if you can't get a tiny business loan?
NORMAN I don't make the rules, I just break `em.
NORMAN I don't break them.
NORMAN I just wanted to rhyme.
NORMAN If she wants us to loan her ten thousand or more, great.
NORMAN Otherwise, I think her only option is a loan shark.
Carl sits back down.
BANK CUSTOMER So, what'd he say?
CARL Do you maybe have any interest in borrowing ten thousand?
BANK CUSTOMER I can't afford the payments on ten.
BANK CUSTOMER You can't do five thousand?
BANK CUSTOMER This is the fifth bank I've been to.
BANK CUSTOMER Please?
CARL Of course we can.
CARL One moment please.
Carl gets up.
He heads over to the soda machine and buys a Diet Coke.
He then heads over to Norman's desk.
CARL (cont'd) Diet Coke?
NORMAN Oooh, thank you.
NORMAN Feed the addiction, am I right?
They clink Diet Cokes.
Norman DOWNS his entire Diet Coke in one swallow.
Carl then heads over to the photocopier.
He watches Norman out of the corner of his eye.
After a couple minutes, Norman gets up and HEADS INTO THE BATHROOM.
Carl heads back over to Norman's desk and SWIPES THE LOAN APPROVAL
Carl returns to the loan desk and STAMPS HER FORM.
CARL It's approved.
The Bank Customer HUGS Carl.
BANK CUSTOMER Thank you so much!
BANK CUSTOMER I promise I won't let you down, Mr. Kendall.
BANK CUSTOMER On me.
The Bank Customer hands Carl a panda beanie baby.
CARL Thanks, Marge.
CARL We don't like to make other customers jealous so can we keep this between you and I?
BANK CUSTOMER Of course.
BANK CUSTOMER Aren't you just a dear?
The Bank Customer leaves.
Carl can't help but be touched.
Carl's at the loan desk.
Norman comes over, looking grave.
NORMAN Carl, could I see you for a moment?
Carl nervously walks into his office.
Carl nervously sits before Norman.
NORMAN Earlier today, you showed some initiative.
NORMAN And I loved it.
NORMAN What do you say to a permanent spot at the loan desk?
CARL That seems like a lot of responsibility.
NORMAN We need a loan specialist a lot more than we need a teller and greeter.
NORMAN Besides, you'd have a starting salary of 52.
CARL Grand?
NORMAN No, dollars.
NORMAN What is this Darfur?
NORMAN Sorry, Patricia, that was inappropriate.
NORMAN Of course grand.
NORMAN To celebrate, next Saturday, I'm throwing a party.
NORMAN Dress up as your favorite character from Heroes.
NORMAN Save the cheerleader, save the world.
CARL Next Saturday...
CARL sounds great.
NORMAN Don't dress as Hiro.
NORMAN I got dibs.
CARL Wouldn't think of it.
Carl heads back to the loan desk, happy about his promotion.
Carl walks in the door.
Peter, Lucy and Rooney, who's clearly been there for a little while, comes up to him.
ROONEY Carl Kendall?
ROONEY Out in the world?
ROONEY Are you some kind of ghost?
ROONEY Am I having a religious vision?
CARL Believe it.
CARL Because this guy just got a promotion.
LUCY Congrats, Carl!
ROONEY Well let's get you a beer.
ROONEY You want a 20 ouncer?
ROONEY I'm just joking -
CARL Yes.
Rooney looks at Peter and Lucy.
PETER A normal-sized beer is fine with me.
LUCY I think I'm done actually.
ROONEY Two twenty ouncers and one tiny, little beer, barkeep.
BARTENDER Please don't call me that.
BARTENDER We're not in the middle ages.
ROONEY I can't believe you're out here.
ROONEY I'm giddy.
ROONEY I feel like a child whose best friend has strict Chinese parents who never let him come out and play but now his Chinese parents are away for the Chinese New Year.
ROONEY You have any interest in pounding this shit?
CARL Why not?
Rooney picks up his beer and begins pounding the twenty ouncer.
Carl reluctantly pounds it as well.
Rooney slams his on the table.
Carl puts it on the table.
ROONEY What do you say we have another?
CARL Yes.
ROONEY You are a beast!
LUCY Well, it's been fun watching you guys recreate freshman year, but Peter and I have some furniture errands to run.
Carl's a little drunk now.
CARL Have a good day yuppifying your lives.
PETER We need a sofa, Carl.
PETER We're not buying a second home.
ROONEY Whatever, yuppy sellouts.
LUCY It was good seeing you.
LUCY You should come out more often.
CARL Please don't leave me here with him.
Peter and Lucy laugh, not realizing that Carl is serious.
They leave.
Carl and Rooney are really drunk.
CARL I have not been this drunk in years!
CARL The room is spinning in a bad way!
ROONEY Barkeep!
ROONEY Two more double pints s'il vous plait!
BARTENDER That was the last `barkeep.' I am cutting you off.
ROONEY Well fortunately you're not the only game in town!
ROONEY Let's go to some place with class.
Rooney and Carl are in a Senor Frogs.
CARL Where's the class?
ROONEY They wear uniforms here.
A SENOR FROG'S WAITRESS comes over.
SENOR FROG'S WAITRESS Jello shot?
CARL Yes.
Carl and Rooney do jello shots.
-- Carl and Rooney downing more jello shots.
-- Carl and Rooney drinking beers.
-- Carl and Rooney are drunkenly staring at a nearby group of girls.
CARL (cont'd) That girl is hot.
CARL (cont'd) Or at least she seems hot.
CARL (cont'd) I'm kind of too drunk to tell.
CARL (cont'd) Right now, honestly, you seem hot.
ROONEY I am hot.
SENOR FROG'S WAITRESS Another jello shot?
Yes.
I think I'm done.
Carl downs the jello shot.
He stumbles a little.
SENOR FROG'S DJ Senor Frog's famous karoake contest is starting now!
SENOR FROG'S DJ Sign up and sweep us off our feet!
ROONEY You gotta do karoake.
Carl STUMBLES over to the Senor Frog's DJ.
He's losing control and he likes it.
CARL Sign me up, bitch.
SENOR FROG'S DJ We've got our first victim...
SENOR FROG'S DJ I mean, singer.
MUSIC CUE: The opening notes of White Town's "Your Woman"
Carl grabs the microphone and heads out into the crowd.
(NOTE TO READER: As you read this part, I recommend listening to White Town's "Your Woman."
It will bring it to life in a way that words on a page cannot do it justice.)
CARL Just tell me what you've got to say to me, I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth, It comes as no surprise at all you see, So cut the crap and tell me that we're through.
CARL Now I know your heart, I know your mind, You don't even know you're being unkind, So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways, Just use me up and then you walk away, Boy you can't play me that way.
Carl heads over to the HOT GIRL and begins SERENADING HER.
She thinks it's kind of funny.
CARL (cont'd) Well I guess what you say is true, I could never be the right kind of girl for you, I could never be your woman.
Carl gets really close to the Hot Girl's face and then COYLY pulls away for the bridge of the song.
During the awesome bridge, Carl does some fantastic dance moves.
Or rather, moves that you think are fantastic when you're drunk out of your mind.
The Hot Girl laughs at his antics.
CARL (cont'd) Well I guess what they say is true, I could never spend my life with a man like you, I could never be your woman.
CARL (cont'd) I could never be your woman.
CARL (cont'd) I could never be your woman.
Carl lands on one knee in front of the Hot Girl.
The crowd CHEERS FOR HIM.
The Hot Girl's LARGE BOYFRIEND gets up close to Carl.
Everyone is very, very drunk.
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND Were you just flirting with my girlfriend?
CARL It depends -- is that your girlfriend?
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND Yes.
CARL Then yes.
HOT GIRL Hey, c'mon.
HOT GIRL Be cool.
HOT GIRL He was just screwing around.
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND Let me handle this, Crystal.
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND So, you want to have sex with my girlfriend?
CARL Yes, I do.
CARL Very much.
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND Are you starting a fight?
ROONEY C'mon, Carl, let's go --
CARL Yes, I am.
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND Then bring it.
CARL I will.
Beat.
Carl doesn't really know what to do so he slaps him across the face the way a woman would slap a man.
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND What was that?
CARL Me bringing it.
The Brutish Boyfriend PUNCHES Carl in the head.
CARL (cont'd) I'm too drunk to feel!
CARL (cont'd) I'm like Darkman!
Carl HEADBUTTS the guy.
They get into a dirty, drunken tussle.
Both of them are trying to hit the other one in the groin region.
Bouncers DESCEND ON THEM and PULL THEM APART.
Carl and Rooney are outside.
Carl's nursing his wounds.
They are very, very drunk.
ROONEY You popped that guy!
ROONEY He didn't know what hit him.
CARL You do not cross Carl Kendall.
The Hot Girl STUMBLES out of Senor Frog's.
HOT GIRL Hey.
HOT GIRL I'm sorry about Domingo.
HOT GIRL He likes to think he's my boyfriend but he's not.
HOT GIRL You're cute.
The Hot Girl KISSES Carl.
HOT GIRL (cont'd) (CONT'D) Want to go some place private?
CARL Yes.
Light is streaming in through the window.
Carl opens his eyes.
He's in bad shape.
He looks over to see the Hot Girl finishing getting dressed.
HOT GIRL My fiance called.
HOT GIRL He was like really sorry about last night.
HOT GIRL I have to go.
CARL Your fiance?
HOT GIRL Domingo.
HOT GIRL The guy who punched you in the face.
CARL I thought you said you two weren't even dating?
HOT GIRL We were broken up last night.
HOT GIRL It was fun hanging out.
The Hot Girl kisses Carl on the forehead.
HOT GIRL (cont'd) I made some coffee.
HOT GIRL (cont'd) It's in the kitchen.
HOT GIRL (cont'd) Sorry for leading you on.
The Hot Girl LEAVES.
Carl smiles.
That was awesome.
Carl runs to the conference room.
The Just Say Yes seminar has been packed up.
Carl walks up to the counter.
CARL Hi...
CARL is there a Sanji Gupta staying here?
RECEPTIONIST Room 125.
Carl walks down the hallway.
He knocks on Room 125.
After a couple minutes of shuffling around, Sanji opens the door.
CARL I'm Carl.
CARL The guy from yesterday.
SANJI Of course, of course!
SANJI Please come in!
Carl comes into Sanji's hotel room.
SANJI (cont'd) Would you like a cup of coffee?
CARL No thanks.
CARL I just wanted to thank you for that inspiration.
SANJI Fantastic.
SANJI So how do you plan on continuing with your journey?
CARL You know, just living every day to it's fullest.
CARL And, like, learning to continue to experience life or whatever.
SANJI Outstanding, Carl.
SANJI Except for one
You are completely bullshitting me!
CARL I just said I'm going to keep experiencing life.
CARL I thought you'd be happy.
SANJI You're like a cigarette addict, Carl.
SANJI Except you're addicted to boredom.
SANJI On the way in here, Carl, I offered you a coffee and you refused.
SANJI Perhaps that would have been the most delicious cup of coffee you would have ever had.
SANJI Who's to say?
SANJI Not you, Carl, because you said no!
SANJI Anyone can quit smoking for a day.
SANJI But for a lifetime?
SANJI No.
CARL So what should I do?
Sanji PULLS OUT a contract.
SANJI Behold, Carl, -- the Maniyesto.
Carl takes the Maniyesto.
CARL 1) Until New Year's Eve, I must say yes.
CARL 2) The yes cannot distort the truth.
SANJI You cannot say "Yes, the world is flat" because that is an untruth.
CARL 3) If someone discovers you are a yes man, you do not have to say yes to them.
CARL 4) To avoid yes, you cannot avoid contact.
CARL Therefore, you must always answer your phone, the door, your postal mail, your email, etc and so on and so forth.
CARL 5) You must choose a yesponsor to keep you on the straight and narrow.
CARL Who should that be?
SANJI A close friend who will not tell a soul.
CARL 5) I hereby void the "do you want" loophole.
CARL What is that?
SANJI If someone asks you "do you want to go to the art museum" and you do not want to, you may not use this lack of desire as an excuse to not go.
SANJI And finally, a warning.
SANJI If you say `no', even once, even for a cup of coffee, be prepared to lose every single little thing you've gained.
SANJI So what do you say, Carl?
SANJI What do you say?
CARL I say...
CARL yes.
Carl signs the Maniyesto.
SANJI And here.
Carl signs again.
SANJI (cont'd) And here.
Carl signs again.
SANJI (cont'd) And initial here.
SANJI (cont'd) And here.
CARL Is this like a legal document?
SANJI Kind of.
SANJI And finally, my friend, please hold out your hand.
Carl holds out his hand.
Sanji PULLS OUT an iron brand that's been heating over a hot pot and BRANDS CARL'S PALM.
SANJI That should heal by New Year's.
SANJI Until then, you are a Yes Man.
Carl looks at his palm.
In the center of the palm, Sanji's branded a `YES.'
Carl is sitting across from Peter.
PETER For a whole year?
CARL Yesterday I got promoted and beat up and hooked up with this chick and I have a massive headache today and I still might throw up, but I don't care because it was the best time I've had in like forever.
CARL Not to mention finding out that, despite what you might think, smoked whitefish in an omelette is delicious, even if covered in a thick layer of pepper.
PETER But for a whole year?
CARL You don't understand.
CARL I got promoted.
CARL Do you know how long I've been waiting for some kind of financial step forward?
CARL I said `yes' and it arrived.
PETER Well, someone sounds like they're yuppifying their life.
CARL Excuse me for wanting an appliance in my kitchen besides a hot pot.
PETER There's no way you can do this for a whole year.
CARL That's where you come in.
CARL You're my "Yesponsor."
PETER Yesponsor?
CARL Like in AA.
CARL I need you to hold me to it.
PETER You aren't going to last for more than a week.
CARL I look forward to proving you wrong.
Peter and Carl shake hands.
CARL (cont'd) Nice suit.
CARL (cont'd) If I move up anymore at the bank, I might need a few.
PETER Cavalli.
PETER Silk and cotton blend.
PETER Seven fifty.
Lucy comes over and kisses Peter.
LUCY My girlfriends are being such bitches.
LUCY It's been two weeks and no one's offered to throw me a wedding shower.
PETER That's too bad.
PETER I'm sure someone will offer.
LUCY Hey, you want to throw my wedding shower?
Peter turns to Carl, smiling.
CARL I'd be happy to.
LUCY I was kidding.
LUCY Wedding showers are thrown by girls.
CARL That's sexist.
CARL Please.
CARL I insist.
LUCY Thanks.
LUCY That means a lot to me.
Lucy hugs Carl.
Carl looks over Lucy's shoulder at Peter and shakes his head.
Rooney comes over.
ROONEY That was some good times last night.
ROONEY You back for more?
CARL Yes.
ROONEY I've got no cash.
ROONEY You mind spotting me and my buddies?
Rooney points to FOUR BARFLIES sitting at the bar.
PETER Sorry, didn't bring my wallet.
Peter turns to Carl.
CARL Yes.
Carl walks up to the bar.
Peter's snickering behind him.
CARL (cont'd) What kind of beer do you guys want?
ROONEY'S FRIENDS/ROONEY As long as you're buying, I want a Grey Goose straight up./Kir Royale/Whatever's in that dusty bottle back there that you never take down.
Carl wakes up.
He looks at the tattooed "Yes" on his hand.
Carl goes through a series of junk mail flyers for credit cards.
He VERY CAREFULLY fills each one of them out.
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.
Before the cashier can say anything...
CARL Black coffee, large.
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Would you like...
CARL To have a wonderful day?
CARL I would.
Carl turns to see a giant poster with the words "DO YOU WANT A MOCHA CARAMEL COOLATA?" Carl turns back to the cashier.
CARL (cont'd) And could I also have a Mocha Caramel Coolata.
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER With whipped cream?
Carl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a frozen coffee drink and several boxes of Munchkins.
He walks by Renee and wordlessly takes a flier.
RENEE Hey, give that back.
RENEE You already took one.
CARL What's the hurt in taking another?
RENEE Destroys the Earth.
RENEE Also, they cost me ten cents a copy.
RENEE Besides, are you even going to come?
CARL Of course.
CARL I couldn't say `no.'
As he walks away...
CARL (cont'd) Even if I wanted to.
RENEE See you tonight, Carl!
Carl sits at his cubicle, and flips on his email.
In the background, we see various SUPER HAPPY EMPLOYEES eating the Dunkin Donuts that Carl has brought.
We see on the screen another email from the King of Nigeria.
CARL Dear deposed King of Nigeria.
CARL I would love to help you anyway I can with your confidential transaction.
CARL Please let me know what I can do.
CARL Yours, Carl Kendall.
He checks the next email.
CARL (cont'd) Would I like Viagra?
CARL (cont'd) Yes, I would.
Carl writes back to the Viagra.
ANGLE ON THE SCREEN: The next email is from PERSIANWIFEFINDER.COM.
CARL (cont'd) (CONT'D) Do I want a Persian wife?
Perhaps I do.
Carl clicks onto the Persianwifefinder.com and starts uploading his profile.
Norman walks by.
CARL (cont'd) Norman, would you say I prefer Iranian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or no preference?
Carl's reading his email when a HIGH SCHOOL GIRL sits down.
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL You Carl Kendall?
CARL Yeah.
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL I hear that you do small loans.
CARL Where did you hear that?
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL Marge.
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL The lady my mom buys her beanie babies from.
CARL I told her not to say anything.
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL I only need five hundred bucks.
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL I'm starting college next year and I need it for books.
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL I can't afford them now but I can pay them off over the course of the year.
Carl looks to make sure Norman's not around then he stamps her form.
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL (cont'd) Thank you so much, Mr. Kendall.
Carl walks down the street, taking fliers from anyone who passes them out.
We do QUICK CUTS of him with various people as he walks down the street.
CARL I might have some stuff to pawn./I will definitely check out your gun selection./I would like to learn Korean.
BERLITZ FLIER GUY If you're interested, intro to Korean is starting right now.
Carl's sitting in a Korean class with several businessmen.
CARL (in Korean, with
SUBTITLES) [Hello, my name is Carl.
SUBTITLES) What is your name?]
Carl stands at the back of a basically empty dive bar, nursing a beer.
There's a makeshift stage at the front of the bar.
"The Flying Buttresses" are setting up their equipment, including a giant clear plastic harp.
Renee steps up to the microphone.
RENEE Hello Jake, Penelope, Carl and Rodrigo.
RENEE We are the Flying Buttresses!
Their four audience members cheer.
The drummer bangs his sticks together and the band launches in.
They are terrible.
Like really terrible.
Renee sings in a high-pitched voice that she probably thinks sounds like Tori Amos, but sounds more like a dog whistle.
If you've heard the singer, Joanna Newsom, well that's who she's emulating.
RENEE (cont'd) Everyday, the unicorns they play/Among lingonberry fields/They silently bay/The king has no crown/Just a vest of grass/The queen loves the Jester/The Jester has the last laugh.
RENEE (cont'd) You are my minotaur/With your cloven hooves!/Half man, half horse/You are all boy to me
Carl looks at the three other audience members.
They are nodding along.
Also, one of them is dressed like a Court Jester.
Renee's whisper singing.
RENEE (cont'd) A witches cauldron/burns hot as hell/As her crooked hand/Brews a love spell.
Renee's singing a power ballad.
RENEE (cont'd) I!
RENEE (cont'd) Am!
RENEE (cont'd) A!
RENEE (cont'd) Fairy!/I!
RENEE (cont'd) Like!
RENEE (cont'd) To Fly!
The four people in the audience clap hard as she finishes.
Renee takes a huge bow and motions to her fellow band mates.
Carl, not knowing how to politely react to the horror show he just witnessed, claps along.
Renee gets off the stage and walks over to the bar, right next to Carl.
BARTENDER Nice, show Renee.
BARTENDER One virgin mint soda coming right up.
RENEE I don't think I hit a high enough octave in Fairy Dream Song.
CARL I disagree.
CARL I think you hit some pretty high octaves.
RENEE But I can hit like way higher.
RENEE Like check this out.
RENEE I think this tone might be more appropriate for my water nymph song?
CARL I don't know -- I've known some water nymphs with big balls.
CARL From the high level of testosterone.
An awkward moment where Renee doesn't react and Carl thinks he may have offended her.
Suddenly she starts laughing spazzily hard.
Carl smiles.
RENEE I've got to write a song about that.
RENEE I could call it...
CARL "Big Balled Water Nymph"?
CARL It's a working title.
RENEE I like it.
RENEE I can work with that.
The drummer, a guy named LEEORE, shouts down to Renee from the stage.
LEEORE Um, excuse me, but we have to clear the stage.
RENEE I gotta clear.
RENEE Unless of course, you want to help?
CARL Sure.
CARL I love clearing stages.
Carl helps a surprised Renee clear the stage.
Carl has helped Renee fit the giant harp into the back of her ancient Volvo.
RENEE Well, thanks for coming, Carl.
RENEE I must bid good night.
CARL So early?
CARL It's only 8:00?
RENEE I lead a jogging, photo group for people who want to both exercise and practice photography.
CARL You're a photographer too?
RENEE Amateur, but yeah.
RENEE I show every Friday.
RENEE (cont'd) If you want to do some artistic calisthenics join us tomorrow.
CARL What time do you leave?
RENEE Five.
RENEE So we can see the sunrise.
CARL Wow.
CARL I haven't seen the sunrise maybe ever.
CARL I guess now I'll be doing that tomorrow.
RENEE Oh, it's beautiful.
RENEE Makes great photos.
RENEE Nice meeting you, Carl.
Renee gets in her Volvo and drives off.
Carl walks off.
FLIER GUY You interested in learning Spanish?
Carl takes the flier from the Flier Guy.
Carl walks down the street, now holding a zillion fliers.
Carl gets a tap on the shoulder.
REVEAL Kath standing there.
KATH Thinking of learning a couple foreign languages?
CARL Hey, Kath.
CARL Would you like one?
CARL I'm going to learn Swahili.
KATH Maybe next week.
KATH There's someone you should probably meet.
KATH Carl, this is Seb.
A very tall, very blond, Nordic looking man approaches Carl.
CARL Seb?
CARL What is that?
CARL Swedish?
SEB Yes.
Beat.
Seb puts his hand on Kath's back.
Carl notices this and is not particularly happy.
SEB (cont'd) I've heard a lot about you, Carl.
Seb's phone rings.
SEB (cont'd) Sorry, sweetie.
SEB (cont'd) I've got to take this.
Seb walks off and answers his cell.
CARL You're on a date then?
KATH Yeah.
KATH Met him at my firm.
CARL He's very tall.
KATH I guess so, yeah.
Seb returns.
CARL Well, it was nice meeting you, Seb.
CARL So I'll be going.
Carl starts to walk off.
SEB Unless...
SEB you'd like to join us?
Carl stops in his tracks.
He mouths the word "fuck."
Carl turns.
Kath nods at Carl as in, "You don't have to join us."
SEB (cont'd) It was good meeting you --
CARL I'd love to.
CARL Join you guys.
KATH What?
Seb, Carl and Kath are sitting at dinner.
It is incredibly awkward.
Kath and Seb are clearly incredibly pissed off.
CARL So, how did you guys meet?
KATH I told you.
KATH Through the firm.
A waiter arrives.
WAITER Would you like to order some wine?
KATH/CARL/SEB Yes.
CUT TO LATER -- Carl, Kath and Seb are now slightly drunk.
However, it is a quiet, angry drunk, not a fun-loving drunk.
They are still sitting in silence.
Seb turns to Kath and starts saying something quietly to her.
CARL Oh, this is good.
CARL I was walking past Pizza Hut the other day, and for a second I was sure the sign said "Pizza Hat."
CARL And then I thought, wouldn't it be funny if there was a shop that sold hats shaped like pizzas?
CARL You know.
CARL Because it sounds like "Pizza Hut" only it's a hat shop.
SEB Look, Carl, why don't you just eat your fish and fuck off?
Carl puts the rest of his meal in his mouth, gets up from the table and walks out of the restaurant.
As he leaves, he smiles to himself.
His phone rings.
He sees it's Rooney on the Caller ID.
CARL Shit.
Carl answers the phone.
ROONEY What's up Carl?
ROONEY It's Rooney!
ROONEY What do you say we grab a couple brewskis?
Carl flips on his computer.
He's trashed.
He has a bunch of emails.
He clicks on the email.
NIGERIAN KING (V.O.) Dear brother Carl, Thank you for your last note you sent me.
NIGERIAN KING (V.O.) But we must move quickly.
NIGERIAN KING (V.O.) I must have your bank details right now.
NIGERIAN KING (V.O.) Send them to me.
NIGERIAN KING (V.O.) Your Associate, Omar, King of Nigeria
CARL Dear Omar, While I appreciate the gravity of your situation, perhaps a goodwill branch is in order.
CARL Could you perhaps loan me a million and take it out of my final cut?
CARL Then I will happily send you my bank details.
CARL Sincerely, Carl.
Carl then flips on persianwifefinder.com.
A PERSIAN CARTOON GENIE comes onto the screen.
PERSIAN CARTOON GENIE Sa'laam, Carl.
PERSIAN CARTOON GENIE You have sixty-five winks.
PERSIAN CARTOON GENIE Allah Akbar.
The screen is suddenly filled with pictures of Persian women.
Carl's alarm goes off.
Carl hits it and sits up.
He grabs his head and then runs to the bathroom and throws up.
Renee, along with several other amateur photographers in sweat suits, have gathered.
They all have big cameras around their necks.
Carl walks up to them.
He does not look good.
CARL Good morning.
RENEE Wow.
RENEE You look tired.
CARL Well, it is five in the morning.
RENEE Mammals are meant to be up at dawn.
RENEE It's how we're built biologically.
RENEE Where's your camera?
Carl realizes he forgot his camera.
CARL I thought I'd use my phone.
Carl pulls out his camera cell phone.
RENEE Awesome idea.
RENEE So light.
CARL That's what I thought.
RENEE Let's hit it.
Renee, Carl and the group of amateur jogging photographers start jogging.
Carl can barely keep up with them.
RENEE (cont'd) Oooh, pretty.
As she passes a flower, Renee snaps a photo of it.
The group reaches the lake as the sun rises.
They all snap photos.
Carl finds himself snapping photos on his camera.
He accidentally snaps one of Renee with the sun behind her.
She looks pretty in the photo.
RENEE Alright!
RENEE Enough standing around!
Renee starts jogging again.
Carl starts after her and then abruptly doubles over and throws up on the ground.
Renee and the other jogging/photographers snap photos of him.
Carl sits across from an Iranian women.
IRANIAN WOMAN It was delightful meeting you, Carl.
CARL As it was meeting you Farinoush.
IRANIAN WOMAN Although I must say I was surprised to discover that you are in no way Persian.
IRANIAN WOMAN Nor are you six foot two.
IRANIAN WOMAN You should change that on your profile.
CARL Will do.
CARL Should I call you?
IRANIAN WOMAN Sorry, I want a tall guy.
The Iranian Woman leaves, passing Lucy.
LUCY Who was that?
CARL Farinoush Azzam.
CARL Great girl, but I don't think we're right for each other.
LUCY How'd you meet?
CARL PersianWifeFinder.com.
CARL Let's talk wedding shower.
LUCY So, I know it's just a wedding shower, so who cares really?
LUCY And it's like so lame?
LUCY But I've made an appointment at a stationery store.
LUCY Are you going to totally kill me?
CARL You kidding?
CARL I love stationery.
Lucy gets up.
Carl follows her.
He does not look happy.
Lucy and Carl are looking over a book of stationery with the STATIONERY PROPRIETESS.
Carl can't concentrate.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS This one is nice.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS I especially love it in cream.
LUCY Ooooh, pretty.
LUCY What do you think?
CARL Looks good to me.
LUCY Thanks for your opinion.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS It's always difficult to get the husband-to-be's opinion.
LUCY I'm not marrying him.
CARL I'm just helping throw the shower.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS Oh.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS What's the party going to be like?
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS Sometimes it helps to know that before you pick an invitation.
LUCY Nothing special.
LUCY Just hors d'oeuvres and wine.
Carl, meanwhile, is looking through the book of invitations.
CARL Look at this -- Bridal Bingo.
CARL What's Bridal Bingo?
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS It's bingo, except you yell out embarrassing facts about the bride and whoever fills their card first wins.
CARL That sounds fun.
LUCY I'm not doing Bridal Bingo.
CARL How about a calendar shower?
LUCY Can we concentrate at the task at hand?
CARL Do you even know what a calendar shower is?
CARL Maybe a calendar shower is awesome.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS Every guest gets assigned a month and brings a gift that the bride and groom can use during that month.
LUCY That's kind of cute.
CARL I think that's really cute.
Carl's starting to get really into it.
He turns the page and sees an invitation decorated with animals labeled "Knights in White Armor."
CARL (cont'd) Look at this one -- "Knights in White Armor."
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS The bride and groom ride in on a white stallion.
CARL You have got to do that.
CARL Like it's not even a choice.
LUCY That seems a little extreme.
CARL You only get married once.
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS Your friend happens to be right.
LUCY You're really good at this.
LUCY You mind helping me with the wedding invitations?
Carl's sitting across from an Arab Guy at the loan desk.
ARAB GUY I love cell phones.
ARAB GUY I breathe cell phones.
ARAB GUY I own, myself, thirty-five cell phones.
ARAB GUY My brother is an idiot and he's selling cell phones hand over fist.
ARAB GUY What do you have?
ARAB GUY A Nokia 9850?
The Arab Guy goes to grab Carl's phone.
He sees the photo of Renee on the phone's wallpaper.
ARAB GUY (cont'd) Oooh, pretty lady.
Carl grabs his phone back.
CARL How much do you need?
ARAB GUY Eighty five hundred.
CARL Done.
Carl stamps his form.
TEN YEAR OLD GIRL I was with my sister?
TEN YEAR OLD GIRL And we had this lemonade stand?
TEN YEAR OLD GIRL And we sold like a hundred cups of lemonade in two days?
TEN YEAR OLD GIRL And so I want to expand?
TEN YEAR OLD GIRL (cont'd) All I need is three thousand dollars?
Carl stamps her form.
JITTERY GUY Just give me the cash.
CARL You promise you'll pay it back?
JITTERY GUY Basically.
Carl stamps his form.
Norman comes over.
NORMAN May I speak to you, Carl?
Norman sits across from Carl.
NORMAN I know what you're doing.
CARL What am I doing?
NORMAN You're loaning below our minimum.
Carl doesn't know what to say.
NORMAN (cont'd) You thought I wouldn't notice the paperwork?
NORMAN (cont'd) I'm not the regional manager because I ignore the details.
CARL I'm sorry, but it's absurd that if you need a small amount of money you have to go to a loan shark.
CARL Only rich people can pay back loans over ten grand.
CARL A bank's job is not to just help the rich.
CARL It's to help anyone with a dream achieve it.
NORMAN I know.
NORMAN These microloans are pretty interesting.
NORMAN So I'll you spearhead a little pilot program at the bank.
CARL Thank you so much.
NORMAN If corporate finds out, you're the one who's getting fired.
NORMAN So keep it quiet.
Carl mimes zipping up his mouth and throwing away the key.
Rooney sits down across from Carl.
CARL What do you need a loan for?
ROONEY I don't.
ROONEY I was wondering if you were around tonight to help me move?
CARL Why don't you hire movers?
ROONEY Because it's cheaper to ask you.
Rooney and Carl are looking at a fridge.
ROONEY Can you carry the fridge alone?
CARL Yes.
MOMENTS LATER Carl is carrying the fridge down the stairs.
He FALLS down the stairs with the fridge.
Carl looks up at Rooney who's at the top of the stairs.
ROONEY You OK?
CARL Yes.
CARL Do you want to help at all?
ROONEY I wish I could, but I hurt my back trying to move that fridge.
Carl has put the last box into the moving van.
Rooney and his mom are hugging.
ROONEY'S MOM I'm going to miss you, baby.
ROONEY And I'm going to miss you, ma.
ROONEY'S MOM I can't watch you go.
His mom goes into her house.
CARL Where are you moving?
Rooney looks at Carl and smiles.
Carl's eyes go wide.
MUSIC CUE: "JUMP" by the Pointer Sisters
-- Carl's taking Korean.
CARL (cont'd) [What is the weather like in Pyongyang?]
-- At Southwest Bank.
NORMAN We need a volunteer to think up local marketing ideas
Carl raises his hand.
Carl has put up signs on the bank window that say "Pet-a- Puppy" day.
There's a box of puppies in the bank.
Customers are streaming into the bank to pet puppies.
-- We see Carl's CALENDAR filling up.
-- A ton of different kinds of credit cards are POPPING
-- Carl's taking Spanish.
CARL [I like to drive with my mother.]
The door to the language center opens.
-- Carl walks towards work.
He sees the same group of flyer guys and DUCKS DOWN an alleyway.
We now see that to avoid the flyer guys he uses a series of alleys and fire escapes, crossing roofs, even jumping between two buildings so he can avoid being approached.
-- At Southwest Bank.
NORMAN We need someone to be a weekend cashier.
Carl's hand shoots up.
-- Carl walks out of a movie with a woman who's in a head scarf.
He awkwardly hugs her.
REVEAL that the movie they watched is Saw III.
-- Carl's at THE NOTE singing along to Renee's band's songs.
He and the "Jester" audience member do shots together.
-- Carl's walking around a florist shop with Lucy.
She points to a small bouquet of white flowers.
Carl points to a giant heart-shaped ice sculpture.
-- We see Carl having to write in tiny letters on his calendar because it's so full.
-- At Southwest Bank.
NORMAN (cont'd) We need a volunteer --
Carl's hand shoots up.
NORMAN (cont'd) -- to be in charge of day care.
-- CUT TO Carl with a bunch of kids.
All the kids are folding brand new dollar bills into paper airplanes
-- CUT TO Carl walking down the street, a big smile on his face, taking everyone's fliers as per usual.
He walks past a CULTY GUY named TONY who's passing out books.
TONY Do you want to change your life through Mahayana Buddhism?
Carl takes one of the books.
TONY (cont'd) Would you like to have tea and discuss?
CARL I'm kind of in a rush...
TONY My place is right around the corner.
Carl's sitting awkwardly on the floor across from Tony.
They are both drinking tea.
TONY It is only through the four noble truths and the destruction of desire that we can end suffering.
CARL Well, that's really neat.
CARL So, thanks for the books and the jasmine tea and the vegan curry, but I have to go --
TONY Do you like Dionne Warwick?
Tony flips on Dionne Warwick's "I Say a Little Prayer."
TONY (cont'd) Now she had style.
CARL It was really great meeting you --
TONY C'mon, Carl.
TONY Shake your groove thang.
Tony pulls Carl up.
Carl starts to awkwardly shake his groove thing.
TONY (cont'd) I like big guys.
CARL I really have to go.
Tony grabs Carl and kisses him full on the lips.
TONY Want to go into my bedroom?
CLOSE IN on Carl's face.
He looks down on the "Yes" that's on his palm.
CARL Yes.
Carl and Tony head into his bedroom.
CARL Do you have any candles?
CARL I just love candles.
TONY Sure.
Tony instantly pulls out candles and lights them.
CARL How about wine?
CARL Like a bottle of Beaujolais?
TONY I only have Beaujolais Nouveau.
Tony pulls out a bottle of wine and two glasses.
Tony goes in to kiss Carl.
CARL I have herpes.
TONY Upstairs or downstairs?
CARL Downstairs?
TONY Front door or back door?
CARL It's a swinging door!
TONY Just give it!
Tony pushes Carl down onto the bed.
Carl's sitting across from Peter in Peter's fancy law office.
They're each eating burgers.
PETER What's with the kitten?
PULL BACK to reveal a kitten on Peter's desk.
CARL I just adopted her.
CARL If you're interested, they're giving them away in front of Petco.
PETER I don't want a kitten.
CARL Neither did I.
PETER'S SECRETARY Andy Solomon on line two.
Peter picks up the phone.
PETER Hey, asshole, we're not talking until you sign that goddamn contract.
Peter hangs up.
PETER (cont'd) I spoke to Kath.
PETER (cont'd) I hear you met her boyfriend, Seb.
CARL Seems like a nice guy.
PETER She was upset you went on her date.
CARL He asked me to join them.
PETER I think you're taking this too far.
CARL I have no choice.
CARL I'm a yes man.
CARL I must say yes.
CARL If Seb asks me to join them on their date, I must.
CARL If some dude asks me for a loan I have to give it to them even if it's clearly never going to be paid back.
CARL If a guy asks me into his bedroom, I must hook up with him.
PETER You hooked up with a dude?
CARL It's like hooking up with a strong woman.
CARL I honestly don't see what the big deal is.
CARL I am guided by yes.
CARL Yes has become my superpower.
CARL And let me tell, yes is turning out to be a pretty sweet deal.
CARL Now if you'll excuse me I'm late for Korean class.
PETER You hate Korean food.
CARL That's no reason to write off an entire, vibrant culture.
CARL See you later, buddy.
Carl heads off, the kitten under his arm.
Carl walks around a photography gallery.
Renee's photos are up.
They are terrible photos, since they were taken while she was jogging.
Their subjects are blurry.
Some of them are half in the photo and half out.
The featured photo is of Carl throwing up on the ground.
CARL You really are displaying that.
RENEE That's probably my best photo ever.
RENEE My collages aren't bad.
RENEE But personally, I think I excel at pottery.
Renee POINTS to a LARGE, BROWN PLATE that looks like poo.
CARL Wow.
CARL That's really big.
CARL How do you have time for all this stuff?
RENEE How do you have time to come to every one of my rocks shows even the one in Fairfield county that was seventy-five miles from here?
RENEE I almost skipped that one.
CARL You gave me the flier, so I had to go.
RENEE At first I thought you were a weird stalker and I was scared.
RENEE But now I think you're just a really shy dude with a crush.
RENEE And while it's been suspenseful to see when/if you'd ask me out --
CARL Do you want to go out sometime?
RENEE Yes, I would.
CARL By the way, I do other stuff besides follow you around.
RENEE Like what?
CARL I take Korean.
RENEE In that case, what do you say we do Korean?
Carl's eating across from Renee.
He can't stand the food.
He grimaces with every bite, but manages to choke it down.
RENEE Do you want any more squid hot pot?
RENEE It's really good here.
CARL I think I'm good.
CARL To have some more.
Renee spoons a huge amount of squid onto both their plates.
CARL (cont'd) So, all this art you create.
CARL (cont'd) What do you want to do with it?
RENEE What do you mean?
CARL Like, do you want to open a store?
RENEE Where I can sell my photos and pottery?
RENEE Of course not.
RENEE They're terrible.
Carl's surprised that she knows this.
CARL They're not terrible.
RENEE Yeah, they're awful.
CARL I think you're being hard on yourself --
RENEE I'm not asking for sympathy.
RENEE My voice is way too high-pitched, my pottery looks like poo, and my photos are blurry and subjectless.
RENEE But who gives a shit?
RENEE Not everything needs a goal.
RENEE The world is a playground.
RENEE You know that as a kid but then somewhere along the way everyone forgets.
Besides, I can't open a store.
My big master plan is to take a trip around the world.
When?
Like in a couple years?
I bought a ticket for four months from now.
People always talk about that, but you're actually doing it.
Honestly, I'm terrified.
How about you?
Do you like the bank?
It's lame, but you know, it's pretty funny.
My boss Norman always throws theme parties.
So if it's lame why do you work there?
Because...
it's actually not lame.
I just gave the answer I've automatically given for years.
I'm actually enjoying the bank for the first time maybe ever.
I started this pilot program that gives out microloans.
What's that?
Like say you need three hundred bucks to pay for paint so you can start a house painting business.
Rather than paying a loan shark who charges you 300%, now you can come to Southwest Bank.
Whatever.
It's kind of dorky.
RENEE That actually sounds really cool.
The waitress comes over.
RENEE (cont'd) I'm stuffed.
RENEE (cont'd) But I would love to wrap this up.
CARL (in Korean, with
SUBTITLES) [We are very fat.
SUBTITLES) But can I please have this food made mobile?]
RENEE So, what do you say we hit this crazy party?
CARL Funny, not crazy.
CARL My boss is white noise.
RENEE White noise?
CARL You know, like totally boring.
RENEE I don't know anyone who's totally boring.
RENEE Crack a person's shell -- there's always something creepy underneath.
Norman opens the door.
He's dressed as the Japanese character Hiro from the show Heroes.
NORMAN Carl!
NORMAN Welcome.
NORMAN Or should I say, uerukamu!
RENEE What's going on?
CARL I wouldn't bother.
NORMAN You didn't tell her?
NORMAN This is a dress-up as your favorite character from Heroes.
NORMAN Do you watch?
RENEE I currently don't have a television.
Norman stares at her.
NORMAN I don't know what to do with that information.
NORMAN There are drinks, chips, dips, various and sundry noshes.
NORMAN I entreat you to make friends.
NORMAN Let's get this party started!
It's very quiet.
A couple people mill about.
CARL We don't have to stay long.
RENEE It's a party.
RENEE Let's socialize.
Carl and Renee walk up to a MOUSEY GIRL.
CARL I'm Carl.
CARL This is Renee.
KHATOON Hey.
KHATOON I'm Khatoon.
It's complete silence.
Beat.
KHATOON (cont'd) Do I know you from somewhere?
CARL I don't think so.
KHATOON Are you listed on Persianwifefinder.com?
Renee laughs.
Carl fake laughs with her.
KHATOON (cont'd) Seriously, though, are you?
CARL So, how do you know Norman?
KHATOON Karate Club.
Norman comes in with more chips.
There are now about ten times as many snacks as guests.
NORMAN Baked Lays people!
NORMAN It is on!
CARL You're in a karate club?
Everyone's standing around Norman.
They've laid several pieces of wood out over a coffee table.
PARTY GUESTS Norman!
PARTY GUESTS Norman!
PARTY GUESTS Norman!
Norman KARATE CHOPS the wood in half.
The guests cheer.
Norman takes a big bow.
RENEE Told ya there was something weird under that white noise shell.
Renee leaves Carl.
KHATOON You're totally on persianwifefinder.com.
KHATOON SultanCarl.
Carl turns to Norman.
CARL Khatoon, Norman!
CARL You guys should spar!
Khatoon and Norman start to spar.
Carl sits back, smiling.
JASON, a cynical guy who's slightly drunk, sidles up beside Carl.
JASON Well, isn't that cute?
JASON We've got a full match on.
JASON Hey, I'm Jason.
They shake hands.
CARL I'm Carl.
CARL What do you do?
JASON Work for the INS.
CARL Cool.
JASON I hate it.
JASON Everyday I have to dash some poor guy's dream.
JASON I'm a professional dream dasher.
CARL It can't be that bad.
JASON The other day, I turned down a guy who had literally been a professor at the University of Cuba.
Jason's sitting across from a CUBAN PROFESSOR.
CUBAN PROFESSOR What?
CUBAN PROFESSOR But I've already lived here for five years.
CUBAN PROFESSOR I've received a steady paycheck and paid taxes for five years.
CUBAN PROFESSOR I speak fluent English.
CUBAN PROFESSOR I can't go back.
JASON I'm sorry but no can do.
CUBAN PROFESSOR I've passed the citizenship test ten times.
CUBAN PROFESSOR I bet you couldn't pass that test.
JASON You're probably right.
CUBAN PROFESSOR Do you know the location of the Spanish-American war?
JASON Spain?
CUBAN PROFESSOR No.
JASON America?
CUBAN PROFESSOR No.
JASON Spainerica?
CUBAN PROFESSOR You are an insult to your country.
CARL So did you let him in?
JASON I sent him back to Cuba.
JASON I send them all back.
CARL If you hate your job so much, why do you do it?
JASON Because I have to eat.
CARL You're a no man.
JASON Excuse me?
Beat.
Carl makes a difficult decision.
CARL I'm not supposed to tell anyone this except for my Yesponsor, but you can change your life.
CARL I've changed mine.
CARL If I tell you how, will you promise not to tell anyone?
JASON (sarcastically whispering
BACK) Yeah, sure, whatever.
CARL I say yes.
CARL To everything.
CARL Say Yes More.
CARL It's that simple.
Dramatic beat.
Jason finishes his drink.
JASON That's the most retarded idea I've ever heard.
Jason heads off.
Renee returns.
RENEE What did I miss?
CARL Nothing.
CARL Do you want to go?
Carl and Renee walk into Carl's apartment.
Ten kittens and puppies come running up to them as they enter.
RENEE You work for the ASPCA?
CARL I just love pets.
CARL This is Veronica, King George, Owen, Carl jr., Carl the III, Carl IV, Bubbles, Greedo, Cat 1, Cat 2 and Cat 3.
CARL At the end there, I got kind of bored of naming them.
They walk into Carl's living room/bedroom.
The room is piled floor to ceiling with boxes.
Renee starts to go through the boxes.
CARL You don't need to do that.
RENEE You have a lot of Mexican Viagra.
CARL I have a congenital heart thing it helps.
CARL And it's cheaper than the stuff that's made here.
RENEE You better not be a criminal.
RENEE Because one time I dated this guy who jacked cars for a living and I did not enjoy living on the edge as much as I thought I would.
CARL It's cheaper to buy in bulk.
CARL Is that a crime?
RENEE A hundred boxes of Mexican prescription drugs borders on something vaguely criminal.
Beat.
RENEE (cont'd) Well, are you going to make out with me or what?
CARL Yes.
Carl grabs Renee and starts making out with her.
They fall onto the bed.
REVEAL Rooney watching them.
ROONEY You must be Renee.
ROONEY I have heard so much about you.
ROONEY Can I watch?
Carl doesn't know what to say.
Before he has to say yes...
RENEE No, you can't watch.
Renee and Carl lie next to each other.
RENEE You know what I would love?
RENEE A massage.
CARL I give great massages.
Carl starts massaging her.
RENEE Oooh.
RENEE Yeah.
RENEE Oooh, right there.
Carl stops.
RENEE (cont'd) Don't stop.
Carl continues massaging her.
Carl's still massaging her.
He stops.
RENEE (cont'd) Can you please keep massaging?
Carl starts massaging again.
Carl's massaging.
His hands are really cramping up.
She's asleep.
He stops massaging.
RENEE (cont'd) Please keep massaging, please?
Carl starts massaging again, wincing while he does it.
Carl's sitting across from a LARGE MAN.
Carl's hands are like claws.
A line of people waits to speak with him.
CARL How much does a Schwinn cost?
LARGE MAN Three hundred fifty three dollars.
LARGE MAN It'll really help me get my one hour delivery business off the ground.
LARGE MAN I've tried on foot.
LARGE MAN I only have a two mile radius.
CARL Done and done.
Carl stamps the package.
Norman comes over to the loan desk.
NORMAN Hey, the boys upstairs are here to speak with you.
CARL Really?
CARL Because I have a thing at one...
NORMAN He asked for you specifically.
NORMAN Ixnay on the small loans-ay.
Carl looks over.
He sees the President (from the beginning of the movie) sitting in the conference room.
Carl gets nervous.
Carl walks into the conference room.
The bank president, CHRIS PARKER, motions to a seat.
CHRIS PARKER Carl Kendall?
CHRIS PARKER I'm Chris Parker.
CHRIS PARKER President of Southwest Bank.
CARL I actually met you when I was just a teller.
CHRIS PARKER (no recollection of it at
ALL) Of course!
ALL) Pet-a-Puppy day.
ALL) Free cookie day.
ALL) Free half hour on the bank's punching bag day.
ALL) You've upped walk-in traffic by 35%.
ALL) Not only that -- you've also taken charge of corporate day care.
ALL) I like a team player.
Carl's phone buzzes.
The caller ID says LUCY.
CARL Thank you.
CHRIS PARKER But then I got suspicious.
CHRIS PARKER What drives a man in his mid to late thirties who's still at the absolute lowest level of our corporate family?
CHRIS PARKER Generous helpfulness?
CHRIS PARKER Or raging revenge?
CARL Generous helpfulness?
CHRIS PARKER Which is when I got the numbers from your loan desk.
Carl turns white.
Carl's phone buzzes again.
The text says
CARL Uh huh.
CHRIS PARKER You've given out over 682 below minimum loans.
CHRIS PARKER One of them was literally for fifteen dollars and eighty seven cents.
CARL Janice Peabody's ant farm rental business.
CHRIS PARKER How do you explain yourself?
CARL I've started a microloan project.
CARL I figure that if someone needs less than ten grand why should they go to a loan shark when they can come to a legitimate banking institution?
CHRIS PARKER Because the paperwork makes any profit moot.
CHRIS PARKER Unless you're raiding our coffers.
CARL No.
CARL I wouldn't do that.
CHRIS PARKER I would if I could, so why wouldn't you?
Chris laughs.
Carl laughs.
Chris abruptly stops laughing.
So does Carl.
Carl's phone buzzes again.
The text says
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) But then I looked closer at the numbers.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) 85% of the loan recipients have been paying them off according to the bank's schedule.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) Not just that, but 72% of that group have returned as regular full loan customers.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) This is both a moneymaker and good for the community.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) That like never happens!
CARL Thank you.
CHRIS PARKER You're the kind of person we want in corporate.
CHRIS PARKER We're taking some clients on a golfing trip.
CHRIS PARKER You golf?
CARL Yes.
CHRIS PARKER You free tomorrow?
CARL Yes.
CHRIS PARKER Of course you are.
CHRIS PARKER I better watch my back around you, Carl Kendall.
CHRIS PARKER Soon you'll be taking my job.
CHRIS PARKER See you on the links.
Chris Parker grabs Carl's hand and shakes it.
Carl RUNS out of the office.
Carl RUNS up to the bakery.
Lucy's outside.
LUCY What happened?
CARL I'm sorry -- bank meeting stuff.
Lucy and Carl wander around a fancy bakery.
LUCY I've never heard of a Wedding Shower cake.
CARL You have to have one.
CARL Modern Bride calls them a necessity.
Carl's phone rings.
CARL (cont'd) Sorry, Luce.
CARL (cont'd) Work stuff.
CARL (cont'd) Yeah, I can definitely be at the blood bank in twenty minutes.
Carl hangs up.
Lucy suddenly starts crying.
CARL (cont'd) Are you OK?
LUCY I'm sorry, it's just you've been so great at all this while my husband- to-be has been completely absent.
LUCY Do you have time to grab a cup of tea?
Carl and Lucy are each drinking tea.
The only other people in the tea room are groups of women.
LUCY Is he scared to get married?
LUCY Is that why he doesn't care?
CARL You know Peter.
CARL He's a man's man.
CARL He cares, he just doesn't know how to show it.
LUCY You know how to show it.
LUCY A wedding is a huge deal.
LUCY I'm so scared.
CARL You guys are perfect for each other.
LUCY I know that and yet I'm still so scared.
CARL Maybe if you're just honest with him about how you're feeling it'll be OK.
LUCY He can be just so closed off.
Carl's phone rings.
CARL Sorry, the bank, you know?
CARL The UFO conference is tonight?
CARL No, that's fine, I'll definitely be there.
Carl hangs up.
CARL (cont'd) I'm sorry.
LUCY You've been so good to me.
LUCY I've really come to depend on you.
LUCY I want to pay you back.
CARL Not necessary.
LUCY Peter tells me you might have some disposable income these days.
CARL For some reason, the bank keeps promoting me.
LUCY If you want to look at some open houses, I'm happy to waive my fee.
Carl and Lucy walk into a luxurious apartment.
Gourmet kitchen, floor to ceiling windows, giant media center.
LUCY So this is at the very top end of what you could probably afford.
LUCY Are you interested?
Carl hits a button.
A GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN DESCENDS.
CARL Yes.
LUCY Are you sure?
LUCY I mean, this is the first place you've looked --
CARL Yes.
CARL I've got to run.
LUCY I'm looking forward to meeting Renee tonight.
CARL What?
LUCY We're all having dinner.
LUCY Tonight.
LUCY Remember?
CARL Right.
CARL Of course.
Carl runs out.
Carl giving blood while on the phone.
CARL I just think if we're going to be rolling out a no interest financing campaign we should commit hard.
He checks his watch.
The NURSE walks by.
CARL (cont'd) Can you unhook me?
CARL (cont'd) I have a really important meeting.
NURSE If you're interested in donating plasma, feel free to sign up.
Carl's listening to a lecture.
WEIRD PROFESSOR Between 1996 and 2000 England's Ministry of Defence paid security cleared experts to research UFOs.
WEIRD PROFESSOR This classified study was code named Project Condign.
Carl's phone rings.
People look angrily at him.
He stands and PASSES OUT in the aisle.
Carl PULLS UP and RUNS inside.
His friends are all waiting.
Carl pulls Renee aside.
CARL I'm sorry I'm late.
RENEE That's fine.
RENEE It's only the very first time I've met your friends.
CARL It was work, it went crazy late.
Carl takes a breath.
He's about to pass out.
RENEE What's with the "They're Out There" and "I Gave" button?
REVEAL Carl's sporting buttons that say "They're Out There" and "I Gave."
CARL Long story.
CARL Miss, could I have an orange juice?
CARL Like fast?
Renee, Carl, Kath, Seb, Peter and Lucy sit around a table at a nice restaurant.
As per usual, Carl has several different meals in front of him.
He also has a martini, a glass of water, and a glass of orange juice.
Carl's showing off to his friends.
As he shows off, Renee looks irritated.
CARL Your wife found me a really great place.
CARL Built in Bose surround sound, a 100 inch LCD flat screen TV, roof deck with jacuzzi.
LUCY Least I could do.
LUCY At least he's involved with our wedding.
PETER I likey your suit-ey.
PETER Hugo Boss?
CARL Oh, this old thing?
CARL Prada, I think.
RENEE You think?
RENEE We went to three different Prada stores to find the right fit.
LUCY What do yo do for a living, Renee?
RENEE I paint.
RENEE I'm in a band.
RENEE I do volunteer work at a shelter.
RENEE I teach ESL.
RENEE I do balloon animal art.
RENEE You know, a little of this, a little of that.
CARL You should check out her pottery.
CARL It's really big.
RENEE It is big.
RENEE How about you guys?
LUCY Real estate broker.
PETER/KATH/SEB Lawyer.
Quiet beat.
The conversation's not exactly flowing easily.
PETER If you'll excuse me.
Peter leaves.
The waiter comes over.
WAITER Have you made a decision about the wine?
CARL Well, we're kind of in a celebratory mood.
WAITER In that case, may I suggest a 97 Petit Rothschild?
The Waiter points at a wine that costs $400 a bottle.
CARL Maybe we should wait for Peter to decide.
LUCY He doesn't know crap about wine.
LUCY Just pick one, Carl.
Carl is sweating bullets.
CARL Why not?
CARL Let's celebrate.
WAITER With six people, I'd recommend two bottles.
Everyone's drinking the wine.
Carl's terrified of the bill.
LUCY Do you rent or own?
RENEE I sublet.
RENEE I have this corner of a loft.
CARL It's a really nice corner though.
LUCY If you're ever interested in buying, you should ring me up.
RENEE I hate owning things.
RENEE Because when you own something, you suddenly are invested in that thing not breaking.
RENEE And I break everything.
RENEE I've gone through three TVS in three years.
SEB How did you break them?
RENEE I smashed one with a hammer, dropped one off my roof and the third one just went on the fritz.
RENEE So I set it on fire.
Carl's friends don't really know what to say.
The check comes.
Carl grabs it before anyone else can.
It's a $1500 bill.
He drops several credit cards down on the table.
CARL It's on me!
CARL I'd like to split it between an Advanta Blue Business, Mastercard, a Diners Club and my South Dakota Bank Visa Check card.
Carl's outside with Peter.
PETER Nice job with Renee.
PETER She's definitely odd, but that's not necessarily --
I just spent $1500 on dinner.
What?
Why?
Because the waiter asked me if I wanted the expensive wine and you weren't there to stop me!
Don't get mad at me about it.
You can just stop.
No I can't.
If I didn't say yes to the band flier, I never would have met Renee.
If I hadn't said yes to taking charge of bank day care and then yes to becoming a loan specialist and then yes to the president's golf trip, I wouldn't be moving up.
Each yes leads to the next one.
If I stop, it could all fall apart.
You've gone from a passive guy who always said no to a passive guy who always says yes.
Just saying yes is not a legitimate life philosophy.
I don't know why I should be taking advice from a guy who's wife is pissed he's not involved at all with the wedding planning.
I'm involved.
You told her you don't care whether the invite's cream or ivory.
I can't see the difference.
Honestly, I'm terrified.
CARL What?
CARL Why?
PETER It's marriage, you know?
PETER The biggest thing ever.
CARL But you guys have dated for years.
PETER I know.
CARL You're perfect for each other.
PETER I know.
CARL She's terrified too.
PETER Really?
CARL Of course she is.
CARL I think you'll both be a lot less terrified if you're terrified together.
PETER But what if I really can't tell the difference between ivory and cream?
PETER Does that make me a bad husband?
CARL What matters is that you pretend you can see the difference.
The girls and Seb come out from the restaurant with their coats on.
There's a silent beat.
GIRLS It was wonderful meeting you!/I loved it!/Let me know when you throw your next art thing!
Everyone gets into their cars.
Carl and Renee walk off.
RENEE It was great meeting your friends.
CARL They're a little stiff.
Beat.
RENEE They are a little stiff.
RENEE What do you feel like doing?
CARL I'm actually going rollerblading with Ralph.
RENEE Ralph?
CARL You know, crazy rollerblading guitar man.
RENEE The guy who plays at the promenade?
CARL Any interest?
RENEE No.
RENEE It's ten on a Friday night.
RENEE And that guy's crazy.
RENEE Don't you want to go home and make out?
CARL Yes.
Carl and Renee are making while Carl surreptitiously checks his watch.
Finally, Renee stops kissing him.
RENEE Just go.
Carl and CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN rollerblade down the street while guitar man plays guitar.
CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN Which is why the merman is not to be trusted, especially with the fisherman's computer brain.
CARL That is really good to know.
CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN You want to come see the merman?
CARL Yes.
Carl dashes in, covered in spots of paint.
Chris appears.
CHRIS PARKER What happened to you?
Carl's playing really intense, terrifying paintball with Norman and Rooney.
CARL I do this whole Habitat for Humanity Thing.
CHRIS PARKER I love the concept of charity.
CHRIS PARKER It's awesome.
A group of KOREAN GENTLEMAN approach Carl and Chris.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) This is Carl Kendall.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) This is Jin Kim, Joo-Chan Park, Soo Lee and Seung Kim.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) Seung's the CEO of Korean Bank International.
The Koreans shake Carl's hand.
CARL (in Korean, with
SUBTITLES) [It is an honor to meet you.
SUBTITLES) Do you like America?]
The Koreans all start speaking Korean at Carl.
Carl clearly doesn't understand what they're saying.
Chris and Carl follow the Koreans.
CHRIS PARKER You speak Korean?
CARL Just a little.
CHRIS PARKER You sneaky devil.
CHRIS PARKER I knew I should watch my back around you.
CARL Is it a problem if I've never played golf before?
CHRIS PARKER You're a funny one, Carl Kendall.
CHRIS PARKER Remember, they have to win.
CHRIS PARKER In Asian cultures, there's a concept called Saving Face.
CHRIS PARKER You have to let them win.
CHRIS PARKER But if they smell for a second that you haven't tried your hardest, they'll commit hari kari.
CARL Metaphorically?
CHRIS PARKER Who knows?
CHRIS PARKER It's a delicate balance, Kendall.
CHRIS PARKER Like two little girls on a see saw with a crocodile beneath them.
CHRIS PARKER Make the wrong move, and the little girl will end up in the croc's maw.
Carl stands with the Koreans.
Seung Kim is speaking very rapidly at Carl.
Carl has no idea what he's saying.
Seung Kim laughs.
Carl laughs along with him.
Chris hits a beautiful shot.
His ball lands almost on the green.
The Koreans notice and nervously chatter.
Chris approaches Carl.
CHRIS PARKER Alright, buddy.
CHRIS PARKER It's all you.
Carl grabs a nine iron from the golf bag.
Everyone seems very impressed.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) You must have quite a powerful stroke.
CARL I do.
SEUNG KIM [Good luck, my friend.]
CARL [I shall need the luck.
CARL This is my first time playing.]
Seung Kim laughs.
CARL (cont'd) Why does everyone think I'm joking?
Carl gingerly places the golf ball on the tee.
He looks towards the hole.
CARL (cont'd) That's really far.
Carl lines up his shot.
He swings back, then forward, and PLOWS the club into the grass, knocking the ball off the tee.
The ball rolls down a slight incline resting just a couple feet from where Carl hit it.
CARL (cont'd) [You're up, Seung Kim.]
Carl walks back to where Chris is at.
CHRIS PARKER What was that?
CARL Just keeping them on their toes.
CARL Reverse psychology.
CARL Tiger Woods does it.
Seung Kim raises his club back.
He too dubs it, driving the club deep into the grass.
His ball rolls just a couple feet past Carl.
-- Carl hits the ball straight into a group of trees.
-- Seung Kim, standing right in front of a pond, delicately taps his ball right into the pond.
-- Carl keeps divoting the grass.
He divots so many times that he has to move the ball out of the hole's he's accidentally dug.
-- Seung Kim hits his ball out of the sand trap.
It rolls back in.
He tries again.
It rolls back in.
He's about to try again when Carl picks up his ball and tosses it over the lip of the sand trap.
Carl holds his finger up to his lips: "Shhh."
-- Carl's about to hit the ball when his phone rings.
He answers it.
CARL (cont'd) Of course not.
The other golfers look really impatient.
CARL (cont'd) Male.
CARL (cont'd) Apartment.
CARL (cont'd) I prefer light beer.
CARL (cont'd) Three to five times a week.
CARL (cont'd) Orlando.
Carl holds up his finger.
Only one moment.
-- It's getting late.
Now both Carl and Seung Kim are hitting their balls at once to save time.
They are both running and hacking at their balls across the fairway as if they're playing a deranged game of field hockey.
Carl is counting up the scores.
CARL Chris, you hit a 90.
CARL Nice one.
CHRIS PARKER I bogied the fifth hole.
CHRIS PARKER I'm still pissed about that.
CARL Joo-Chan hit a 95.
CARL Nice work.
CARL As for Seung Kim.
CARL You hit 453.
Seung glowers at Carl.
CARL (cont'd) And as for me, I hit...
SEUNG KIM Yes!
Seung Kim pumps his fist.
CARL I'm sorry to say that team Korean Bank International has won.
Seung Kim slaps five with his compatriots.
Carl, Chris and the Koreans are all hanging out.
Carl is alone in the corner of the conference hall.
A PRETTY FEMALE KOREAN BANKER approaches Carl.
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER [You are quite the golfer.]
CARL [I golf from crotch noodle.]
Beat.
She laughs.
He laughs along with her.
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER [I have a business proposition for you.
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER My marriage is not a happy one.
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER I often find my needs are left unsatisfied.]
CARL [I agree.
CARL The weather is sunny.]
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER [I wish that was so.]
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER Kiss me?
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER Please?
Carl doesn't know what to do.
CARL Yes.
She kisses him passionately.
Carl breaks away from the kiss.
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER Am I not sexy?
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER Have you not heard of saving face?
CARL You're very sexy.
Carl and the Korean Banker kiss more.
Carl looks guilty.
Carl's shaking hands with the Korean Bank Representatives.
Chris shakes Carl's hand.
CHRIS PARKER I'm promoting you to bank manager.
CHRIS PARKER I've got my eye on you, boy.
CHRIS PARKER Don't you forget it.
Chris laughs.
Carl nervously laughs along with him.
The Pretty Korean Banker walks by and waves at him.
Carl waves back.
He looks very guilty.
Carl walks into the pottery studio, looking guilty.
Renee is making a giant piece of pottery.
RENEE What's up, chicken butt?
RENEE (cont'd) Are you OK?
RENEE (cont'd) Did everything go OK at golf?
Carl considers whether he should say anything about the kiss.
CARL I just got promoted to bank manager.
RENEE Congratulations!
Renee kisses Carl.
RENEE (cont'd) Oooh, we should do some sexy pottery.
RENEE (cont'd) Like you can rub the clay all over me.
Carl goes to grab some clay.
RENEE I was kidding.
RENEE Not as sexy as it seems.
RENEE It gets in like everywhere.
RENEE What should we do to celebrate?
CARL Have dinner?
RENEE How about Korean?
RENEE Oh, no, you probably already had some today.
CARL No, we just had American food, American fare.
RENEE You've just been so busy -- it'd be fun to have a night just the two of us.
RENEE I wish we could just go to the airport and hop on the first flight outta here.
Carl's eyes light up.
CARL Yes.
Renee and Carl are in line at the ticketing counter.
RENEE I think we're going to London.
CARL Oaxaca, senorita.
RENEE Moscow, Russia, comrade.
CARL (with an unidentifiable
ACCENT) Singapore.
RENEE What was that?
CARL My Singaporean accent.
CARL Pretty good, right?
They get to the front of the line.
CARL (cont'd) We want two tickets on the next plane out of here.
AIRLINE REP Two tickets to...
AIRLINE REP Lincoln, Nebraska.
AIRLINE REP Have a good time.
Carl and Renee take the tickets.
CARL Lincoln, Nebraska!
CARL Here we come, baby!
AIRLINE REP That'll be twelve hundred and thirty three dollars.
RENEE Maybe we shouldn't do this.
CARL I've been promoted.
CARL I've got money to burn.
Carl nervously hands the Airline Rep his credit card.
Carl's walking towards security when he runs into TONY, the homosexual guy he hooked up with.
Tony's handing out his books.
TONY Do you want to change your life through Mahayana Buddhism?
Carl takes one of the books.
TONY (cont'd) Carl?
Carl realizes who he is.
Suddenly they are in the middle of an awkward ex-lover interaction.
CARL Tony.
TONY How've you been?
TONY You...
TONY never called.
CARL I'm sorry.
CARL I've been busy.
TONY Yeah, well, I've been busy too.
Renee comes up and grabs Carl's arm.
RENEE Hey, who's your friend?
Tony looks at Renee and realizes that she's Carl's girlfriend.
RENEE (cont'd) I'm Renee.
TONY I'm Tony.
TONY I'm an old, close friend of Carl's.
ANNOUNCER Flight 2036 to Lincoln, Nebraska, now boarding.
CARL That's our flight.
CARL We should probably get going.
RENEE It was nice meeting you.
CARL See you soon.
TONY Have fun.
TONY You abigail.
Carl and Renee head off.
Renee and Carl have the aisle and window on the plane.
A YOUNG WOMAN comes up to Carl.
YOUNG WOMAN Hi, there.
YOUNG WOMAN Would you mind switching places with me?
YOUNG WOMAN I want to be across the aisle from my mom.
Her MOM is indeed across from Carl.
RENEE We're actually flying together.
YOUNG WOMAN It would really mean a great deal.
YOUNG WOMAN She's very scared of flying.
CARL Where's your seat?
The YOUNG WOMAN points at her seat.
It's a couple rows up in the middle.
Her middle seat's BOOKENDED by a MOM with a SCREAMING BABY and an ENORMOUS MAN.
CARL (cont'd) This is an aisle.
CARL (cont'd) That's a middle.
Renee looks at Carl like, why won't you just refuse?
MOM I'm really scared of flying.
Carl between the crying baby and the ENORMOUS MAN.
Renee turns and waves to him from a couple rows up.
Carl puts on a saccharin smile and waves back.
Carl and Renee are in the airport.
RENEE So, now that we're here, what should we do?
CARL Well, clearly we should go there.
Carl points to an advertisement for a telephone museum: "Come to the Frank H. Woods Telephone Pioneer Museum."
Carl and Renee are looking at MANNEQUINS OF NINETEENTH CENTURY SWITCHBOARD OPERATORS.
It's incredibly quiet.
CARL I had no idea that the earliest switchboard operator headsets weighed ten and a half pounds.
CARL That is fascinating.
RENEE It is?
CARL Not at all.
Renee laughs.
An ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE dressed as a telephone operator approaches.
ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE I'll connect you to the coast in an instant with Alexander Graham Bell's brand new invention -- the telephone!
ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE Just a haypenny per ten minutes.
ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE (cont'd) This place is boring as shit.
ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE (cont'd) Check out the Lester F. Larsen Tractor Test & Power Museum.
ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE (cont'd) Now that's an attraction.
ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE (cont'd) Ask for Billy.
She hands Carl a brochure.
Carl and Renee stand outside.
RENEE We don't have to do this.
CARL We're here.
CARL We might as well.
Carl and Renee RIDE A TRACTOR.
Renee's taking photos as they
The driver TURNS UP THE SPEED.
They're suddenly going crazy fast.
Carl takes the wheel.
The tractor IMMEDIATELY GETS AWAY FROM HIM.
They SWERVE STRAIGHT and CRASH THROUGH THE WALL OF AN OLD BARN.
The DRIVER kills the engine.
Renee, Carl and the Driver catch their breath.
CARL There's, uhh, no power steering.
TRACTOR DRIVER It's a tractor, not a Toyota.
CARL I'm sorry about the barn.
TRACTOR DRIVER Been meaning to tear this sucker down anyway.
Carl and Renee walk around a surprisingly pretty city park.
RENEE I think I might have whiplash from that tractor ride.
CARL Just don't sue me.
RENEE Watch your back, Carl.
RENEE I mean it.
RENEE I'm very litigious.
CARL This day has been so randomly incredible.
RENEE Would you...
RENEE want to...
RENEE travel around the world with me?
RENEE I mean, I know we haven't really been seeing each other for that long, but I don't know...
CARL Yes.
RENEE Yes?
CARL Definitely.
RENEE I think I'm falling, you know...
RENEE Are you...
CARL Yes.
They kiss.
RENEE Before our flight, what do you say we grab a couple Nebraskan steaks?
CARL I'm definitely falling for you.
Carl's sitting in the lounge at the Lincoln Airport.
An OLD WOMAN comes up to him.
OLD WOMAN Excuse me.
OLD WOMAN Would you mind bringing this to my son?
The Old Woman hands Carl an UNMARKED, SHADY-LOOKING PACKAGE.
CARL Like you want me to bring it with me?
CARL On the plane?
OLD WOMAN Fedex is so expensive and this needs to get to him today.
CARL Yeah.
CARL Sure.
CARL I'd be happy to.
OLD WOMAN He's a tall, blond fellow named Sheldon Winkleton.
OLD WOMAN He'll be holding a sign in the terminal with his name on it.
OLD WOMAN You are a dear.
The Old Woman shuffles off.
Carl looks at the box.
Renee returns.
RENEE I got US Weekly, Star and, for a little culture, the National Enquirer.
CARL National Enquirer?
RENEE They have movie reviews.
RENEE What's in the package?
CARL Just a gift for some buddies back home.
Carl walks through security.
He puts the package on the conveyor belt.
They don't notice anything odd.
Carl and Renee sit next to each other on the plane.
RENEE I'm sorry, I have to go to the bathroom.
Renee heads to the bathroom.
Carl takes the package out from under the seat in front of him.
He starts to breathe really hard.
He very gingerly opens the package.
He pulls back the packing peanuts revealing...
a box of homemade chocolates.
Carl breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.
Carl and Renee walk off the plane, Carl carrying the package under his arm.
Carl sees a tall blond guy holding a sign that says "SHELDON WINKLETON."
He heads towards the guy but before he can several DEA AGENTS with ADORABLE, DRUG SNIFFING DOGS surround Carl.
The dogs start BARKING LIKE MAD.
DEA AGENT Put the package down!
DEA AGENT Put it down!
Carl looks up to see "Sheldon" WALKING SWIFTLY OUT THE SLIDING DOORS of the airport.
DEA AGENT (cont'd) Get on the ground!
DEA AGENT (cont'd) Both of you!
The DEA AGENTS KICK the box open.
Chocolates spill out over the ground.
They crack open the chocolates to reveal TINY
RENEE What the hell is that?
CARL I don't know!
As Carl is dragged out by the cops, he passes Tony, standing near the exit, shaking his head.
Carl's sitting across from two DEA Agents, Good Cop Bob and Bad Cop Bob.
GOOD COP BOB I'm Bob.
BAD COP BOB And I'm Bob.
Carl can't help but laugh.
BAD COP BOB (cont'd) Do you find that funny?
Carl sees his hand with "Yes" on it.
CARL Yes.
CARL I'm sorry.
CARL Just let the girl go.
CARL She doesn't know anything.
BAD COP BOB We'll see about that, Carl.
CARL Some old lady gave me a package in the Lincoln airport to deliver to her son, Sheldon Winkleton.
CARL That was really stupid of me and I realize that now.
CARL I don't know anything about anything.
GOOD COP BOB Just answer a few questions and I'm sure we'll get this all sorted out.
GOOD COP BOB Have you ever used illegal drugs?
Carl stares at them.
He should probably lie...
CARL Yes.
GOOD COP BOB Pot?
CARL Yes.
CARL But that's all.
BAD COP BOB How about shrooms?
Carl nods.
CARL But that's the only bad shit I've done.
CARL I swear.
BAD COP BOB Never cheated on a girlfriend?
CARL Yes, I have.
CARL But I was in high school.
CARL I was a mess.
CARL She had cheated on me --
The Bad Cop SLAMS his fist down on the table.
BAD COP BOB You disgust me.
The Good Cop restrains the Bad Cop.
The two cops DISCUSS Carl.
We see Carl freaking out through the one-way mirror behind them as they talk.
GOOD COP BOB He's a moron.
GOOD COP BOB But I think he's telling the truth.
BAD COP BOB I agree.
BAD COP BOB No one ever admits to the cheating question.
Carl's sitting on the steps.
Renee comes out of the station.
RENEE What the hell happened?
CARL I can explain.
RENEE So explain.
RENEE Are you a drug smuggler?
CARL Look, when the nice lady asked me to take them on the plane, I thought they were chocolates.
RENEE You expect me to believe a nice lady asked you to bring chocolates on a plane?
CARL I know how it sounds.
RENEE I don't think you do.
Carl just looks at her.
RENEE (cont'd) If you can't be honest with me, then you and the nice lady can have a fun life in Candyland.
Renee starts off.
CARL Wait!
CARL I'll explain better.
She turns back around.
Carl sits across from Renee.
RENEE So you've just been saying yes to everything.
CARL Yes.
CARL Pardon the pun.
RENEE Oh.
CARL See?
CARL Do you get it now?
CARL It's nothing, just a glitch really.
RENEE I thought we had so much in common but if you just yes to everything I don't know that we do.
RENEE How do I know if you even like Korean food?
Beat.
CARL I don't.
RENEE Do you even want to travel around the world at all or do you want to work at that bank and buy a lot of Prada suits?
CARL Yes.
CARL And yes.
Something registers in Renee.
RENEE When I asked if you were falling for me all you said was yes.
She rises, shaking her head, and heads for the door.
CARL It wasn't a lie.
RENEE Yes.
RENEE It was.
Carl's strapped to a giant plasma donation machine.
It's horrifying.
As he donates plasma, he could not look more depressed.
NURSE It'll be over soon.
CARL I don't care.
CARL Just take it all.
Carl stumbles into the lounge outside Chris's office.
SECRETARY Chris will be with you in a moment.
SECRETARY Would you like something to drink?
Carl walks into Chris's office carrying a cup of coffee a Diet Coke, and a bottle of water.
CHRIS PARKER So I got a call from the police department.
CARL I'm not a drug dealer --
Chris closes the door to his office.
CHRIS PARKER I spent a couple years in prison myself.
CHRIS PARKER So I backdated some stock options.
CHRIS PARKER Excuse me for trying to help our bottom line, right?
CARL You got to do what you got to do to help Mr. And Mrs. Shareholder.
CHRIS PARKER We are their slaves.
CARL Totally.
CHRIS PARKER Honestly, I prefer for all my top guys to have been in the Big House.
CHRIS PARKER We've all eaten the slop.
CHRIS PARKER There's a trust there you can't break.
Chris holds out his hand.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) So, what do you say to being a VP and expanding your microloan program bankwide?
CARL Yes.
Carl shakes Chris's hand.
Carl's office has VIEWS of other corporate parks.
Despite the fancy digs, Carl's depressed.
Chris pokes his head in.
Carl's on the phone.
CARL That's right, we're dropping the minimum loan to one dollar, bank- wide.
CHRIS PARKER Could you look through these numbers and let me know which of our five branches have been lagging behind in profit?
Chris dumps a folder on Carl's desk.
CARL I thought I was just implementing the microloan program.
CHRIS PARKER You're a VP, buddy.
CHRIS PARKER You do it all now.
Carl's taking a pottery lesson.
He is sadly going through the motions of making a pot.
He checks his watch and departs, leaving the unfinished pot spinning on the pottery wheel.
The VPs are sitting around the board room.
Carl comes in, late, still covered in clay.
CARL Sorry about that.
CHRIS PARKER Carl, I'm glad you could join us.
CHRIS PARKER So, to keep you all updated, we should be merging with Korean Bank International within the year.
Everyone claps.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) As per our argument with KBI, we'll be shoring up our bottom line.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) Carl Kendall's done us the honor of drawing up a preliminary list of the branches that are on the chopping block.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) Nice work, Carl.
Carl looks horrified.
Carl's in the middle of a heated discussion with Chris.
CARL You can't close the Maple Branch!
CHRIS PARKER I know that Maple's where you got your start, but if I don't lay those people off then I get laid off.
CHRIS PARKER It's a vicious cycle.
CARL You don't have to if you don't want to.
CHRIS PARKER If we don't close these branches than KBI will buy our competitor instead of us and put us all out of business.
CHRIS PARKER If you want to be an executive and get to do fun stuff like your microloan project, then you also have to be the bad guy who lays people off.
CHRIS PARKER That's why we get paid the big bucks.
CHRIS PARKER To make the hard decisions.
Norman's crying.
Rooney's getting worked up.
NORMAN The bank's all I've got.
NORMAN Every morning I restock the hard candy, polish the safe, write today's interest rates on the board.
CARL There are other banks.
ROONEY We have to protest the merger.
ROONEY Get some grassroots action going.
ROONEY Grass looks weak, but it grows everywhere.
CARL You don't even work at the bank.
NORMAN You should protest with us!
ROONEY Yeah!
ROONEY Protest with your employees!
ROONEY It will only make you more popular!
Southwest Bank employees and Carl stand in a picket line outside the corporate offices.
EMPLOYEES Hell no!
EMPLOYEES We won't go!
EMPLOYEES Hell no!
EMPLOYEES We won't go!
Chris gets out of his car and heads to the office.
Carl hides his face from Chris so that Chris won't recognize him.
ROONEY Throw a rock at him.
NORMAN Yeah, throw a rock!
Carl grabs a rock and VERY DELICATELY LOBS IT in Chris's direction.
He then TAKES OFF RUNNING in the opposite direction.
He then CIRCLES AROUND and runs into the back entrance of the bank.
We FOLLOW Carl as he runs up the service entrance to the corporate offices.
Carl then RUNS into his office and sits down at the desk.
He's covered in sweat and is breathing heavily.
Chris pokes his head in.
CHRIS PARKER Some asshole protestor threw a rock at my head.
CARL Those dicks.
CHRIS PARKER I wish using hoses wasn't such bad
Chris leaves his office.
Carl sits across from Peter.
CARL I think I made a mistake letting Renee go like that.
CARL What if I'm supposed to go on that trip?
PETER You own an apartment because of that job.
PETER People don't generally leave good jobs.
CARL But the bank doesn't feel right...
Peter's phone rings.
Peter picks it up.
PETER Hey, honey.
PETER I think we should go with the tulips.
PETER I know roses are more romantic, but they're also much more cliched.
PETER Babe, can you wait a second?
PETER I'm going to be on for a while.
PETER Ask your guru.
PETER He's the one who sent you on this retarded quest in the first place.
Sanji's SIGNING BOOKS.
Carl gets to the front of the line.
CARL Hi, Sanji.
CARL I'm Carl.
CARL Kendall.
SANJI Of course!
SANJI Would you like to purchase my new book, "The Power of Yes: Life is Yessy"?
CARL Actually, I had a question for you...
SANJI Well, this line is for book customers only.
Sanji's eating by himself.
Carl comes up to him.
CARL I'm sorry to bother you again --
SANJI Can't you see that I'm eating?
CARL I have a really important question.
CARL I have to choose between traveling around the world with a girl I'm really into or choosing a job that will make me pretty well off.
CARL I don't know which yes to take.
SANJI How well off?
CARL I don't know why that's important.
SANJI I should know all the data.
CARL A lot, OK?
SANJI This is what I recommend.
SANJI Every winter, I throw a two week long seminar in Aspen.
SANJI It's only ten grand a week and it will open your mind up --
CARL I don't want to go to a seminar.
CARL I just need help with this question.
SANJI For you, eight grand a week.
SANJI I have helped celebrities like Cher and Jack Welch.
SANJI You will love it --
CARL You're a total con artist.
SANJI I am not a con artist.
SANJI Have I not set you on the life path you desire?
CARL I've put my life into the hands of a con artist!
CARL And because of you I have this retarded yes branded on my hand for life!
CARL (yelling to the
RESTAURANT) This man is a con artist!
RESTAURANT) Don't listen to this man!
RESTAURANT) He is a con artist!
Carl runs out of the restaurant.
Carl returns home.
Rooney's on the couch, wearing a headset playing Xbox Live.
ROONEY You are dead, AnalDestroyer832!
Carl PULLS the xBox cord out of the law.
CARL Out!
ROONEY What?
ROONEY Why?
CARL You've slept on my couch for four weeks.
CARL You're a grown man.
CARL Now sack up and get the hell out of here.
ROONEY Will you let me stay here please?
CARL Are you deaf?
ROONEY You have to say yes if I ask you.
CARL You knew?
ROONEY I may not seem like I get it, but I get everything.
ROONEY Lucy and Kath?
ROONEY Made out one time in the bathroom at Rudy's.
CARL Get the hell out of here.
Carl's in front of his computer.
There are a bunch of emails selling Viagra.
He angrily deletes them all.
He gets a letter from the King of Nigeria.
NIGERIAN KING (V.O.) Dear Carl, It is vitally important you send me your bank account information.
NIGERIAN KING (V.O.) The government will be closing in on my account in the very near future.
NIGERIAN KING (V.O.) Your good friend, Omar, Former King of Nigeria.
Carl starts typing fast.
As Carl writes the following email, we cuts of him THROWING AWAY THE BOXES OF STUFF HE BOUGHT OVER THE INTERNET and GIVING AWAY THE SIX KITTENS HE GOT TO
CARL (V.O.) Omar, Let's cut the crap.
CARL (V.O.) You are not a king.
CARL (V.O.) You're probably just a teenage con artist jerking off somewhere in Russia.
CARL (V.O.) Write me again and I will find you and beat your stupid lying face in.
CARL (V.O.) Dick.
CARL (V.O.) Sincerely, Carl Kendall.
Carl angrily flips off his computer.
CLOSE ON THE ALARM.
His alarm goes off.
Carl HITS IT off.
It's now DAYTIME.
Carl gets dressed.
He puts on his suit and tie.
His apartment is noticeably nicer than the last time we saw it.
Carl drives down the street in a FANCY CAR.
He PULLS INTO DUNKIN DONUTS.
He gets out of the car and passes a guy handing out fliers.
FLIER GUY You want to pawn --
CARL No.
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.
The Dunkin Donuts Cashier hands Carl his coffee.
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Would you like an --
CARL No.
Carl hands the Cashier the money.
Carl sits in his office.
Lucy walks in.
CARL Hey, Luce.
CARL What're you doing all the way over here?
LUCY It's been hard to reach you.
CARL I've been a little swamped.
LUCY Everything OK?
CARL Yeah.
CARL Things are great.
LUCY I was wondering when you want to meet with the florist.
CARL Sorry, but I'm too busy these days.
CARL Don't have time to help with the party anymore.
CARL Good luck.
LUCY You're just stopping, just like that?
CARL I'm not the one marrying you.
CARL Maybe you should ask him for some help.
LUCY He is helping.
LUCY Here I was thinking we were actual friends.
Lucy leaves, upset.
Carl doesn't move.
Carl, Chris and the other VPs sit around the conference table.
CHRIS PARKER What is the best way for us to enter the teenage credit card market?
VP Give away a free iPod.
CHRIS PARKER Yes.
ANOTHER VP Include one with cans of Mountain Dew Code Red.
CHRIS PARKER Nice.
CHRIS PARKER Anyone else?
CHRIS PARKER Carl?
CARL Have you guys thought that teenagers don't have the financial knowhow to use a credit card?
CHRIS PARKER That's why they're such a ripe market.
CHRIS PARKER Any ideas on how to pick that low hanging fruit?
CARL Include a Mastercard with every xBox.
CHRIS PARKER I like that.
CHRIS PARKER I like that a lot.
Chris SLAPS FIVE with Carl.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) Now remember, tomorrow's our official merger ceremony with KBI.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) So wear your nice suits.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) I'm talking to you, Feldman.
All the VPs laugh.
Carl fake laughs along with them.
Carl gets home.
He hits play on his answering machine.
PETER (V.O.) (over the answering
MACHINE) Hey, Carl.
MACHINE) Peter here.
MACHINE) Long time no see.
MACHINE) Sorry to hear you won't be planning our engagement party.
MACHINE) Although I guess that makes you less gay than I thought you were.
MACHINE) We'll be watching the game at Rudy's tonight, if you're interested.
Carl DELETES the message.
He FLIPS ON Survivor and starts to absentmindedly sort through his mail.
He throws away junkmail until he gets to a postcard that catches his eye.
He reads the postcard.
JASON (V.O.) Dear Carl.
JASON (V.O.) I know this is kind of random, but I thought I should write you.
JASON (V.O.) We met at that party at Norman's apartment.
JASON (V.O.) I was the INS guy who hated his life and hated you.
JASON (V.O.) I just wanted to tell you that I took your advice.
JASON (V.O.) I quit my job and have founded a home in Botswana for elderly orangutans.
JASON (V.O.) I've never been happier.
JASON (V.O.) You told me to say "yes" and it has turned out to be incredible.
JASON (V.O.) Thank you.
JASON (V.O.) Yours truly, Jason Newmark
Carl TURNS OVER the post card.
On the cover of the card is a picture an orangutan.
Carl's alarm goes off.
He opens his eyes.
He's PROPPED the post card up next to his alarm clock.
The orangutan seems to be staring into his soul.
Carl's writing a list of names.
The post card lies on the desk nearby.
His secretary pops her head in.
CARL'S SECRETARY The executives are gathering in the conference room to officially greet the KBI Officials.
CARL'S SECRETARY (cont'd) Cute gorilla.
CARL It's an elderly orangutan actually.
CARL Could you please call everyone on this list and tell them to show up at Rudy's Bar & Grille this evening at 9PM?
CARL'S SECRETARY Will do.
Carl starts to head out and then turns around.
CARL I just want to say, it was really great having you as my first secretary.
CARL'S SECRETARY You're not firing me, are you?
CARL I don't think I'm going to be working here much longer.
Carl walks into the crowded room.
Korean executives and Southwest Bank executives mingle.
Carl heads towards Chris.
CARL I need to talk to you.
CHRIS PARKER And I need to talk to you.
CHRIS PARKER You mind doing a little ceremonial translating?
CARL I don't know if I'm good enough at Korean --
CHRIS PARKER Believe in yourself and the world believes in you.
SEUNG sees Carl and bows to him.
Carl bows back.
The Pretty Korean Banker sees Carl and coquettishly waves to him.
Chris TAPS the microphone.
The crowd sits down.
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) I'd like to welcome our new partners into the Southwest family.
Chris nods to Carl.
CARL (in Korean, with
SUBTITLES) [Welcome.
SUBTITLES) You will be my partner.]
SEUNG KIM [Thank you.]
CHRIS PARKER KBI is the at the forefront of the financial world.
CHRIS PARKER With your help, Southwest will be as well.
Carl takes a beat.
Chris looks at him, expectantly.
CARL (in Korean, with
SUBTITLES) [He says that you are a son of a dog and like to have the dirty sex.]
SEUNG KIM [What?]
CHRIS PARKER We look forward to working together and extending our reach across the globe.
CARL (in Korean, with
SUBTITLES) [He says in Korea you poop on the ground and that here you cannot poop on the ground.]
SEUNG KIM [That is factually inaccurate]
CARL [I know.
CARL But it's what the bigot believes.]
CHRIS PARKER So with this hand shake, I make official the acquisition of Southwest by Korean Bank International.
Chris holds out his hand.
CARL [Although you have poop on your hand, I am willing to shake it so I can steal all your money, you stupid Korean.]
SEUNG KIM No.
CHRIS PARKER Excuse me?
SEUNG KIM We have a traitor in our midst.
SEUNG KIM This man just called me a son of a dog and informed me that my hand is covered in fecal matter.
SEUNG KIM He is clearly trying to sabotage the merger.
CARL You speak English?
SEUNG KIM You think an international bank financier wouldn't speak fluent English?
SEUNG KIM For whom do you work, traitor?
SEUNG KIM Shanghai Bank?
SEUNG KIM Chinatrust?
CARL For myself.
SEUNG KIM Fine.
SEUNG KIM Keep it secret.
SEUNG KIM Unfortunately, I cannot approve a merger with a company so incompetent as to have a business saboteur this high up.
SEUNG KIM Good day.
Seung Kim walks out, followed by all his employees.
Before Chris can say anything...
CARL I quit.
Carl leaves.
Peter, Lucy, Rooney, Norman, Tony, Loan Recipients, several Persian Woman -- all of Carl's friends along with everyone that he's met on his Yes journey have gathered at Rudy's.
PETER Why does he want us here?
LUCY I have no idea.
Kath and Seb walk in.

PAN OVER to Rooney standing alone.
Farinoush, the Persian woman, walks over to him.
IRANIAN WOMAN I'm Farinoush.
ROONEY I'm Rooney.
IRANIAN WOMAN You're tall.
Just then the lights go down.

Renee nods.
They kiss.
Carl has set up a makeshift loan office.
He's sitting across from a YOUNG THAI MAN.
YOUNG THAI MAN [I need ten thousand bhat to get my first tuk tuk.
YOUNG THAI MAN If I get a tuk tuk I no longer have to mop the ping pong show floor and clean the snake.]
CARL [What snake?]

Carl and Renee get out a dusty minivan.
A dirty, rundown palace rises before them.

A guard with a MACHINE GUN opens up.
MACHINE GUN GUARD What do you want?
CARL I'm here to see Omar.
CARL The former King of Nigeria.
