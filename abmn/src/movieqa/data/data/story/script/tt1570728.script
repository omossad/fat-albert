CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE

Soft music.
A classy joint.
Below the tables, WE PAN well-heeled feet nuzzling.
Finally we SETTLE ON:
WHITE SNEAKERS sitting opposite FANCY HIGH HEELS.
These feet aren't nuzzling.
There's distance here.
PULL UP, REVEALING CAL WEAVER (42) and his wife, TRACY (41).
A handsome couple.
He'd be JFK to her Jackie O...
if he gave a shit.
Unfortunately, he doesn't (i.e.: white sneakers in fancy French restaurant).
Cal pulls out READING GLASSES, looks at the menu.
CAL Well, I'm full.
CAL You were right, hon.
CAL I shouldn't have eaten all that bread.
Want to just share a dessert?
Tracy is lost in thought, gazing at a menu.
CAL You okay, babe?
CAL You seem out of it.
TRACY Yeah, I'm just thinking about what I want.
CAL Me too.
CAL Okay, let's say it at the same time.
CAL One.
CAL Two.
CAL Three...
I want a divorce.
Creme Brulee.
JESSICA (17) chases after MOLLY (9).
Jessica's skinny, wears glasses, a hipster T-shirt.
In five years, she's going to make all the boys' heads spin.
But not yet.
JESSICA I'm gonna getcha!
JESSICA I'm gonna getcha!
She grabs Molly and tickles her.
Molly SQUEALS with delight.
As she kicks...
SMASH!
A picture falls off the
nearby console.
Jessica picks it up:
Cal and Tracy.
This is their house.
JESSICA It's okay, my fault.
Alright, kiddo, it's getting late, let's get you to bed before your parents get home.
Don't give me the puppy eyes, you little maniac.
Go brush your teeth!
Molly GIGGLES, RUNS upstairs.
Once Molly's gone, Jessica looks at the photo.
She eyes Cal affectionately.
Meanwhile, TWO YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WOMEN drink and laugh at a table.
HANNAH (24) is clearly buzzed.
HANNAH I don't care.
HANNAH I love him and given the opportunity, I'd have his babies.
Her best friend, LIZ (29), LAUGHS.
LIZ Seriously?
LIZ Conan O'Brien?
LIZ You'd do Conan O'Brien?
HANNAH I'm just saying, Richard's a lot of things: successful, smart...
LIZ Boring, workaholic, sexually repressed...
HANNAH But he's not very funny, that's all.
LIZ Yeah, well, you want funny, go watch `Cosby' reruns.
LIZ You want a good lay, go get yourself some of...
LIZ that.
She motions off to the side.
HANNAH What?
LIZ The hot piece that's been checking you out for the last hour.
LIZ The smoothest, coolest son-of-a-bitch you've ever seen.
Meanwhile, Cal sits in the passenger seat, dazed.
A "to- go" box from the French restaurant in his lap.
Tracy drives.
TRACY Aren't you going to say anything?
Nothing.
TRACY Almost twenty-five years of marriage, you have nothing to say?
TRACY It's silent.
TRACY Devastating.
Meanwhile, Jessica (the baby-sitter) stops at a bedroom door.
She hears MUSIC coming from inside, puts her ear to the door.
It's Lady Gaga.
It's awful.
She smiles, knocks and opens the door at the same time.
JESSICA Hey, your sister's asleep, just checking you're alive --
She SCREAMS as --
ROBBIE WEAVER (13), quickly covers himself up.
He was masturbating.
ROBBIE Close the door!
who slams the door shut.
I'm sorry, Robbie!
I didn't see anything, I swear.
Robbie lies there frozen, horrified.
Meanwhile, where Liz and Hannah keep drinking.
LIZ I don't know, Hannah.
LIZ Your life is just so...
LIZ PG-13.
Hannah's mouth drops open.
HANNAH My life is not PG-13!
LIZ It so is.
LIZ You've never left LA.
LIZ You pass the bar you're gonna be, what, a patent lawyer, probably married to that snooze-fest Richard.
LIZ I just worry about you is all.
LIZ Hell, you've resorted to fantasizing about Conan `Ginger- Dick' O'Brien.
He's funny.
LIZ He looks like a carrot, honey.
Hannah LAUGHS.
VOICE Who?
They turn.
It's Jacob Palmer (the stud from earlier).
LIZ Hi.
JACOB Hi.
JACOB Who looks like a carrot?
LIZ Conan O'Brien.
LIZ My friend Hannah thinks he's sexy.
JACOB I think your friend Hannah is sexy.
Hannah LAUGHS.
HANNAH You didn't really just say that.
JACOB Pretty sure I did.
HANNAH How old are you?
JACOB Thirty-three next month.
HANNAH Then you should know by now that cheesy pick-up lines don't work.
Jacob sits down at their table, uninvited.
JACOB I find you incredibly sexy.
JACOB It's a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line.
JACOB (CONT'D) There are many attractive women in this bar -- including your friend here -- and I've been unable to take my eyes off you, only you,
for the past two hours.
Again: not a cheesy pick-up line, just a fact.
Answer this quickly, without thinking about your answer: do you find me attractive?
Hannah doesn't flinch.
HANNAH I don't.
JACOB Yes you do.
LIZ Yes, she does.
JACOB I'm an accomplished lover.
JACOB If you come home with me, I am confident you will leave satisfied.
JACOB Multiple times.
HANNAH You've got to be kiddi--
JACOB We'll make love and it will be amazing.
JACOB You'll laugh afterwards and say `I never do this kind of thing.' Then you'll do it again.
HANNAH Is that so?
JACOB It is.
JACOB So now I'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink.
JACOB If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each -- just enough to start losing inhibitions, not
enough to get sloppy, after all: I promised to satisfy you.
LIZ Multiple times.
JACOB That's right.
JACOB So, here we go, Hannah: can I buy you a drink?
Hannah and Liz share a look.
HANNAH What do you expect me to say to that?
JACOB Margarita, rocks, salt.
HANNAH Wow.
She STANDS, grabs her coat and Liz's hand.
HANNAH Okay, time to go.
Liz doesn't move.
LIZ I'll go home with you, you can call me Hannah, I don't give a
HANNAH Liz!
LIZ Another time, maybe.
Still driving, Tracy looks at Cal.
He remains silent.
TRACY I'm unhappy, Cal.
TRACY I've tried not to be.
TRACY We've been married so long, somewhere we became...
TRACY stagnant, you know?
He keeps staring straight ahead.
TRACY Okay, you're not talking and you know that only makes me talk more.
TRACY Maybe that's good, maybe that's good.
TRACY Okay...
There's this person.
No response.
TRACY We've been spending time together.
TRACY Lunches, meetings, that kind of stuff...
Silence.
She closes her eyes tightly.
TRACY I slept with him.
TRACY Kind of.
Tracy opens one eye, taking a peek.
Nothing.
TRACY No, no kind of.
TRACY I can't believe I said kind of.
TRACY That's just not something you do in a kind of way.
TRACY I slept with someone.
TRACY There.
TRACY I said it.
TRACY I slept with someone.
TRACY Oh God.
TRACY It's the worst thing I've ever done but it feels so good to say out loud.
TRACY I slept with someone.
TRACY I SLEPT with someone.
TRACY I slept with SOMEONE.
TRACY I slept with ...
TRACY please stop me, please say something.
No reaction.
TRACY David Jacobowitz.
TRACY From work.
TRACY You met him at the Christmas party.
TRACY You remember that party?
TRACY They had the giant paper-mache wreath?
TRACY I kept asking the decorator how he made it?
TRACY You wore that sweater --
Finally, Cal speaks --
CAL Please stop.
TRACY The last person in the world I'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal --
CAL If you keep talking, I'm going to get out of the car.
TRACY But the fact that I did, that it could happen at all, I think it just shows how broken we are and --
CAL Okay.
CAL She screeches to a stop as he tumbles to the curb in her rearview mirror.
Tracy runs to him.
He's on the curb, BLOODIED but okay.
TRACY Are you out of your mind!?
He looks up at her, pleading.
CAL I'll leave tonight, I'll sign whatever you want me to sign, if you'll just stop talking about it.
She touches his bloody forehead, affectionate.
There's still something here.
TRACY Okay.
CAL Okay.
Meanwhile, Jessica sits on the living room couch.
Robbie ENTERS, stands there.
He's a precocious, adorable, masturbation-addicted, thirteen-year-old.
ROBBIE I'm sorry that you had to see that.
She keeps staring straight ahead.
JESSICA I should have knocked.
Silence.
After a long beat.
ROBBIE For the record: I think about you while I do it --
JESSICA Robbie!
ROBBIE I have a picture of you and I look at it the whole time --
JESSICA Stop it!
ROBBIE I love you, Jessica.
ROBBIE And I know you're seventeen, and I know I just turned thirteen, which is the same age as your little brother, and you're technically my baby- sitter, but someday soon our age difference will be inconsequential which is good because...
ROBBIE I'm pretty sure you're my soulmate.
She stops, looks at him and smiles gently.
JESSICA Listen, Robbie --
LIZ We're home.
ROBBIE Shit.
Jessica jumps off the couch.
JESSICA Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver.
JESSICA How was dinner...
Oh my God, Mr. Weaver, you're bleeding.
Why are you bleeding?
CAL Mrs. Weaver told me she wants a divorce so I jumped out of the car.
CAL Hope the kids behaved.
CAL Come on, I'll drive you home.
Robbie steps INTO FRAME.
ROBBIE Dad?
CAL Oh.
CAL I didn't know you were here.
ROBBIE You're getting divorced?
CAL Yes.
TRACY Cal!
ROBBIE And you jumped out of a car?
CAL A moving car, yes.
TRACY Cal!
I'm sorry you found out this way.
ROBBIE I'm sorry you jumped out of a car.
CAL Thanks.
Jessica, you got your coat?
JESSICA Uh-huh.
Cal drives now.
Jessica in the front.
Awkward.
Finally, Cal starts talking to himself.
Almost shell- shocked.
CAL We'll talk to the kids tomorrow.
CAL Tell them we're separating.
CAL Just separating.
CAL We'll do it together.
He thinks.
CAL I'll have to tell Nanna.
CAL Uch, she's gonna be crushed.
CAL But not right now.
CAL She's got enough to worry about...
He trails off.
Another long beat of silence, then he remembers his company and turns toward Jessica.
So, I hear Stanford early admission, huh.
I know your dad is so proud.
JESSICA Yeah.
You're bleeding real bad, Mr.
Weaver.
She goes to touch his eye.
Out of nowhere...
he starts BANGING THE SHIT out of his steering wheel.
CAL David Jacobowitz!
CAL Are you kidding me!?
CAL DAVID FUCKING JACOBOWITZ!
He calms down, slowly.
Pulls up to a DRIVEWAY.
CAL Sorry about that.
JESSICA It's okay.
Jessica reaches for the door, but stops.
She takes a deep breath, adorable.
JESSICA Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know me very well, but I've been baby- sitting for your family for three years.
JESSICA You're the nicest dad of any of the families I baby-sit for, by a country mile.
You're funny, and you're always really generous, and you're the only dad who's excited -- genuinely excited -- to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner.
Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I like her a lot, but if she wants to divorce you, well...
then I think she's batshit crazy.
Cal smiles, distracted but grateful.
JESSICA In fact -- and, I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable -- I think I've even developed a
Hey: do me a favor -- can you not mention what's going on between Mrs. Weaver and I to your parents?
It's probably better they hear it from us.
Okay?
JESSICA Uh-huh.
CAL That's my girl.
Jessica awkwardly gets out of the car.
CAL Hey, Jessica?
CAL Thanks for listening.
She smiles, turns back.
She freezes when she sees...
He's holding CASH out the window to pay her.
CAL You put this to that fake ID you'll need up at Stanford.
And with a sad wink, he drives off -- leaving her standing there, lovelorn and forty-five dollars richer.
Cal sits at the bar, drinking away his sorrows.
He's disheveled, a bit wobbly.
He motions for the BARTENDER.
Another vodka cranberry?
CAL Yes.
CAL Just...
CAL yes.
A GIRL (30s) approaches the bar.
Cal taps her shoulder, a drunken train-wreck waiting to happen.
CAL Guess what?
GIRL What?
CAL My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me.
GIRL I'm sorry to hear that.
CAL That's very nice of you to say.
CAL She just told me tonight, obviously it came as a bit of a shock and you're not listening anymore.
The Girl has turned back to a group of friends.
CAL I bet you wouldn't ignore me if I were David Jacobowitz.
CAL My wife doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz.
CAL She screws him.
Something catches Cal's eye across the bar.
We PAN TO...
wearing his two thousand dollar suit, he's now got TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN fawning over him at his table.
Cal takes him in for a long beat, turns back to the bartender, and decides:
Gay.
You know these places: basically a "strip" of identical housing units -- usually occupied by newly-divorced dads.
A WOMAN (60s) gives Cal the tour.
WOMAN So it's pretty no-frills.
WOMAN Unit 2 is a lot like unit 1 except you're downstairs so...
WOMAN the ground is closer.
WOMAN Which is nice.
The most depressing, empty, beige place ever.
CAL I guess the price is right.
WOMAN Yeah, well, tons of divorced guys here.
WOMAN You'll fit right in.
Cal SIGHS, un-enthused.
CAL I'll take it.
WOMAN Ooh, the gym has an elliptical machine...
WOMAN I assume you want to get back in shape?
Cal looks down, embarrassed.
CAL I guess.
WOMAN Great!
WOMAN I'll let you know when they fix it.
Cal sits at his desk, doing paperwork.
His BOSS ENTERS.
BOSS Cal, I just got the weekly sales report, good good good!
BOSS You really killed this quarter!
Keep it up you're going to be sitting in my seat by year's end.
Really great, Cal.
Seriously.
CAL Who told you Tracy and I were getting a divorce?
Divorce!
That's it.
Amy heard you crying in the bathroom.
We all thought it was cancer.
Thank God.
CAL I have to go buy furniture now.
Cal stands, EXITS.
BOSS Go for it!
BOSS It could have been cancer, buddy!
Cal is sitting on a plain, faux-modern couch.
He's staring into space.
A SALESMAN APPROACHES.
SALESMAN Can I help you, sir?
CAL My wife is sleeping with David Jacobowitz.
CAL I need a couch.
SALESMAN Ooh, I understand.
SALESMAN Can I give you a word of advice, one divorced man to another?
SALESMAN If you don't mind?
CAL Sure.
SALESMAN Get the matching chaise, killer deal.
He pats the adjacent piece.
Cal processes this.
CAL I want it in beige.
SALESMAN I'll write you up.
Cal's back at the bar, sipping on his drink.
He looks absolutely exhausted.
He looks across the bar.
At his usual table, Jacob is now wooing a NEW WOMAN.
Cal shakes his head, amazed at this guy's chutzpah.
A GUY grabs the open bar stool next to Cal.
Cal reacts.
CAL Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm waiting for a friend.
You've been holding the seat for an hour.
Yeah, well, my wife is screwing David Jacobowitz so eat me.
The guy shrugs, walks away.
Cal looks at his watch, puts a napkin on his drink, and stands.
Cal pees.
Jacob steps INTO FRAME in the adjacent urinal.
Cal does a friendly "I'm peeing next to you" nod.
Then:
CAL Can't help but notice that you're always surrounded by women.
CAL Multiple women.
Jacob doesn't even turn.
CAL I'm getting divorced.
CAL Or, in the process.
CAL Gonna be single again.
Nothing.
CAL Any advice?
JACOB Yeah.
Jacob zips, flushes, turns.
JACOB Don't start conversations with people while they're pissing.
He walks away, washes his hands, EXITS.
A beat, then:
So gay.
Cal's a few drinks in now.
The door to the bar opens as BERNIE (late 40s) rushes in.
An oak tree of a man.
He's carrying a SHOPPING BAG.
BERNIE Sorry I'm late, I had to pick something up from Macy's.
CAL Don't worry about it, here, sit, I've been guarding this stool with my life.
Bernie sits, looks uncomfortable.
CAL It's good to see you, man.
CAL I've called you a few times.
CAL It's been a rough couple of days, obviously.
CAL Nothing I could use more than my old pal Bernie to unload on.
CAL Hey, we should play racquetball, when's the last time we played racquetball?
BERNIE Claire won't let me be friends with you anymore.
Cal takes this in.
CAL I'm sorry, what?
BERNIE She said we had to choose between you and Tracy.
BERNIE I chose you.
BERNIE She said no.
He pulls a WRAPPED PACKAGE from the bag, hands it to Cal.
BERNIE It's cologne.
CAL Are you breaking up with me?
BERNIE Claire's waiting in the car.
BERNIE Um...
BERNIE there's a gift receipt in there.
BERNIE Sorry.
BERNIE Cal is left alone.
BERNIE He raises a finger at the Bartender.
CAL Do you have anything with a worm in it?
CAL Because I'd like a gallon of that now.
ON JACOB Legs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get dumped this whole time.
ON JACOB Jacob shakes his head.
ON JACOB Jesus Christ.
ON JACOB He says something to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table.
ON JACOB She nods, gets up and walks away.
As the Bartender pours him a second shot.
He's now showing pictures from his wallet to the Bartender.
CAL This is my youngest, Molly.
CAL Her two favorite things are High School Musical and her mother.
CAL I hate both of her two favorite things.
CAL Jacob motions for Cal to come over.
CAL Every move Jacob makes is practiced, perfectly cool.
Cal points at himself: "Me?" Jacob nods: "Yep."
Cal SHRUGS, stands, and wobbles over towards Jacob.
JACOB Jacob Palmer.
JACOB I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal.
CAL I already have a drink.
JACOB Let me buy you a drink, Cal.
CAL Okay.
Jacob motions to the Bartender who NODS.
Cal SITS.
CAL My wife is cheating on me with --
JACOB David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've heard.
JACOB We've all heard.
JACOB For the last two nights, I've watched you batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob story.
Cal takes this in.
He STANDS.
CAL You know what, I don't need this
JACOB Sit down, Cal.
CAL Okay.
JACOB Cal, I'm going to make you an offer, it's probably the best offer you're ever going to get, and you're extremely drunk, so it's wildly important that you don't answer until I've finished and you've taken a few moments to process what I'm saying.
JACOB Do you understand?
Cal goes to answer, Jacob holds up a finger.
Cal stops
himself.
Once he's settled, Jacob continues:
JACOB As I said, I've been watching you for two days now and I can say, without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man I've ever seen in my life -- don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it.
JACOB You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L -- I don't know if I want to help you or euthanize you -- stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal.
Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw.
JACOB You asked me for advice before, Cal, so I'm going to help you.
JACOB I don't know why.
JACOB Maybe I'm just bored.
JACOB Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why?
JACOB Why doesn't matter.
JACOB The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and I'm bored as hell and need a project.
JACOB So if you want, I'm going to help you rediscover your manhood.
JACOB Do you remember when it was that you lost it?
JACOB Doesn't matter, we'll find it.
JACOB And when we do, when I'm through with you, that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early.
JACOB That's my offer.
JACOB What do you say?
Cal stares at him blankly.
A long beat of silence.
Cal goes for a drink, almost uses the straw...
then catches himself.
He puts down the drink.
Looks up.
CAL Yeah, okay.
JACOB Mall food court, Thursday, six o'clock.
CAL I'm sorry, what?
Jacob downs his drink, nods at THE WOMAN (now nearby).
JACOB You ready to go?
JACOB Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw.
A well-maintained yard, bordered by shrubs and bushes.
A long driveway runs parallel to the yard.
A medium-sized U-HAUL is parked in the driveway.
Cal EXITS the back door, carrying a BOX.
He loads it into the U-haul and takes a last look back at:
A weathered playground sits off to the side.
You can tell it hasn't been used in quite some time.
Baseball equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son catches.
An oft-used barbecue next to the house.
You can tell a lot about this family from seeing this backyard.
You like this family a lot from seeing this backyard.
TRACY Cal?
Cal looks up.
Tracy approaches.
She's wearing sweats.
It's pretty obvious that she's been crying.
Awkward silence.
Neither knows what to say.
TRACY I just wanted to say that...
Her voice cracks.
She turns away.
TRACY Shit.
TRACY Tracy looks at the U-HAUL, wipes her eyes and tries to lighten things.
TRACY Do you want me to back that thing out of the driveway for you?
CAL I'll be fine.
TRACY You have trouble in reverse is all.
CAL It was two times --
TRACY Three if you count my father's foot.
CAL I did that on purpose.
TRACY I knew it.
They smile, in rhythm for a moment.
Then they realize, stop smiling.
Cal turns awkwardly.
CAL Once I'm settled, I'll get the kids so they can see the place.
TRACY I think I'm have a mid-life crisis maybe.
TRACY Can women have mid-life crisis?
Make sure the lawn gets enough water.
TRACY In the movies it's always men having them and buying ridiculous yellow Porsches, but I'm not a man and I really don't want a yellow
CAL You have to fertilize once a month.
CAL Not twice a month, not once every two months.
She takes a deep breath, finding her balance.
TRACY We got married so young, Cal.
TRACY And I'm forty-one.
TRACY And that's so much older than I thought I'd be.
CAL The sprinklers turn off behind you.
TRACY And I got really upset with an umpire at Molly's t-ball game last month -- like really upset, like I screamed at him and wished he would die -- and I started feeling like the person I promised I wouldn't turn into, you know?
CAL If it rains a lot, you need to shut off the automatic setting.
TRACY And we haven't been us, not for a long time.
TRACY And I don't know when you and I stopped being `us' but...
TRACY I mean, do you?
CAL I think it was when you screwed David Jacobowitz.
Ouch.
Tracy's face registers the blow, but she nods: she also understands it.
CAL Make sure my azaleas get enough sun.
CAL And immediately crashes into the neighboring FENCE.
Cal leads in Molly and Robbie.
CAL Okay, well, this is it.
CAL What do you think?
CAL Didn't have a lot of time to house-hunt, but...
They look around his depressing, beige apartment.
A pathetic TV plays the Disney Channel in the corner.
CAL There's a second bedroom with twin beds so you two can stay over whenever you want!
CAL Anytime!
ROBBIE So...
ROBBIE you're like, actually going to live here?
Molly looks like she's going to cry.
CAL Hey, hey.
CAL Come on now, you'll visit all the time.
CAL Every weekend.
CAL It won't be that bad.
MOLLY Don't you love us anymore?
Cal takes Molly's face in his hands, starts tearing up.
CAL Listen, baby.
CAL What's happening with your mommy and I...
CAL it's not what either of us wanted, not what either of us planned.
CAL (CONT'D) But you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron--
She bolts past Cal to the TV, where ZAC EFRON is on- screen, prancing about in a basketball uniform.
Robbie and Cal stand there, awkwardly.
ROBBIE Don't take it personally.
ROBBIE That show's like crack to her.
Cal NODS.
ROBBIE You okay?
CAL You?
Robbie shrugs.
ROBBIE Can I say something with a curse?
ROBBIE One time?
CAL Yeah.
CAL Why not?
Robbie NODS, takes a deep breath.
ROBBIE Love is fucked.
Cal LAUGHS, a bit of tension relieved.
CAL Is that so?
CAL You in love, buddy?
ROBBIE Well, if you must know --
JESSICA Ding dong.
They turn -- it's Jessica, the baby-sitter.
ROBBIE What is she doing here?
CAL Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for
CAL (CONT'D) I have to run out really quickly, just for a few hours, and your mother wants you to stay here while she's out hooking --
ROBBIE What?
CAL Huh?
The place is...
nice, Mr. Weaver.
CAL Yes, well, that's a generous adjective, thank you.
Anyhow, Jess is gonna keep an eye on you guys for a few.
ROBBIE But I don't need a babysitter!
ROBBIE She's only four years older than me!
ROBBIE You need to know that!
ROBBIE She needs to know that!
CAL I know, buddy.
Cal musses Robbie's hair.
CAL My little boy's growing up, Jess.
CAL He's in love already, can you believe it?
Uch.
Robbie thumps the wall with his head, dying.
CAL Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy?
No response, she's glued to the television.
ROBBIE Wait, where are you going?
CAL I'm, uh...
CAL I decided to take a class.
JESSICA That's great, Mr. Weaver.
JESSICA It's a difficult time for you, it's important that you find new interests, try new things, maybe things you'd never have considered trying before...
Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder.
It's a bit odd.
She realizes, takes it off.
CAL Okay, well...
CAL Molly, last chance!?
But Molly is still locked on Efron.
CAL That's my angel.
CAL Back in a few.
ROBBIE But, Dad --
CAL Nope.
The door slams.
Robbie stands there with Jessica, awkward.
Tries to maintain some semblance of cool.
ROBBIE I don't need a baby-sitter.
JESSICA I know, Robbie.
An awkward beat, then.
ROBBIE I love you so much --
JESSICA Jesus Christ.
Cal pulls into the parking lot, grabs a space.
CAL What am I doing?
He ENTERS, still going.
CAL What the hell am I doing?
CAL Hannah (girl from the bar who Jacob tried picking up).
She's sitting at a table with Liz (her friend) and a GROUP OF REALLY BORING WHITE PEOPLE in suits.
There are SMALL GIFTS in front of Hannah.
Holding her hand is an average guy (33), her boyfriend, RICHARD.
We PICK UP mid-conversation.
RICHARD I think you're wrong.
RICHARD I think that's Tucker.
No, no, no.
Chris Rock is the stand-up comedian.
Chris Tucker is the actor.
Is it racist that I can't tell them apart?
Liz nods her head "yes" at Hannah.
Hannah stifles a LAUGH.
Liz stands.
LIZ Well, Richard: thank you for inviting me to Hannah's `goodbye' party.
LIZ The conversation has been riveting, like stepping back in time.
LIZ Before I go, a toast.
She holds up her glass, toasting.
LIZ Sweetie: go into your hole and study your cute little ass off for that bar exam.
LIZ We'll see you when you emerge.
RICHARD She's gonna kick that bar's butt!
All the dorks CHEER.
Liz SHRUGS.
LIZ Yeah, okay.
Liz CHUGS her drink, turns to Hannah.
I'll walk you out.
Before they clear...
RICHARD Hey, Liz?
RICHARD When my girl passes, we're gonna have another little celebration, right here.
RICHARD Hope you can make it.
RICHARD It's going to be a special night.
LIZ Richard, you just give me a heads- up so I can get really drunk before-hand, okay?
RICHARD You know it!
Hannah leads Liz out of the restaurant, WHISPERS:
HANNAH Did you hear that?
HANNAH `It's going to be a special night.' You think he's going to propose?
LIZ At the Cheesecake Factory?
LIZ Oh God, I hope not.
Why?
Do you really want him to?
Hannah SHRUGS.
HANNAH He's nice.
LIZ Yeah, well...
LIZ Jesus.
LIZ Really?
LIZ Okay.
LIZ Not my life, I love you, call me if you need anything.
LIZ She SIGHS, heads to rejoin them.
Meanwhile, Cal sees Jacob, standing against a pole in the food court.
Jacob is eating pizza, cool as ever.
JACOB You're late.
JACOB Sbarro's?
CAL No thanks.
CAL So what exactly are
JACOB How much money can you afford to spend on clothes today?
CAL I dunno.
CAL Five hundred?
JACOB Three thousand.
CAL Okay.
JACOB We'll start with shoes.
JACOB Let me see those sneakers you're wearing.
Cal holds up his foot.
JACOB Take them off.
Cal bends down, takes one off.
Other one too, please?
Cal does as he's told.
Jacob holds out his hands.
Cal SHRUGS, hands Jacob the shoes.
Jacob simply turns and throws them over the railing.
CAL What the hell!?
JACOB Are you in a fraternity, Cal?
CAL Those were my favorite shoes.
CAL No.
JACOB Are you Steve Jobs?
CAL What?
CAL No.
CAL I'm not Steve Jobs.
JACOB Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever.
JACOB Let's go.
Cal (barefoot) follows Jacob around the store.
CAL I think this whole thing might have been a bad idea.
Jacob ignores him, grabs a pair of BLACK DRESS SHOES.
JACOB Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items.
CAL Ha!
CAL I think I read that in GQ.
JACOB You did.
JACOB I wrote it.
CAL Really?
Jacob CHUCKLES.
Cal CHUCKLES back, clearly unsure what the chuckle symbolizes.
JACOB Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers.
Cal is looking at a pair of ARGYLE SOCKS.
CAL I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you really write for GQ?
Jacob slaps Cal's hand, knocking the socks away.
JACOB Your credit card please?
We watch as Jacob narrates the wardrobe essentials (and as Cal's arms get progressively fuller) in each store.
Cal gets fitted.
JACOB (V.O.) Two suits: one black, one grey.
JACOB (V.O.) One sports jacket, navy preferred.
Jacob leans in toward the tailor.
JACOB Take it in there...
JACOB and there.
Cal holds jeans in front of him, eyes them suspiciously.
JACOB (V.O.) One pair of quality jeans.
CAL These are two hundred and thirty dollars.
CAL Can't we just go to the Gap?
He looks up.
Jacob is gone.
Cal runs outside.
Jacob is already halfway to the car.
CAL I'm sorry!
CAL Don't leave!
Jacob immediately heads back inside and answers:
JACOB No, Cal.
JACOB We can't just go to the Gap.
CAL What's wrong with the Gap?
JACOB In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal.
JACOB It's lowest common denominator.
JACOB Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal.
Jacob holds up a pair of beige slacks.
JACOB (V.O.) One pair of chinos.
CHING.
A cash register DINGS.
JACOB (V.O.) Four dress shirts.
CHING.
CHING.
CHING.
CHING.
Cal's arms are filling.
JACOB (V.O.) Three casual button-downs.
Cal struggles to get a sweater over his neck.
JACOB (V.O.) Two v-neck cashmere sweaters, and finally, a long overcoat.
Cal stands there in an overcoat and sweater.
CAL I'm very warm.
Jacob leads Cal through the store.
He tosses him a TUBE.
JACOB You rub this in around your eyes every night and every morning.
CAL What does it do?
It gives you x-ray vision, Cal.
It tightens things up.
The skin around your eyes looks like Milton Berle's ballsack.
Cal stops, examines his eyes in a mirror.
CAL Oh my God, it does.
Cal is getting his hair cut at a fancy salon.
The HAIRDRESSER is young, hip, and beautiful.
CAL I like to use a number four on the sides and the back, go longer on the top.
JACOB Oh, okay.
JACOB Thanks for that, Vidal Sassoon.
JACOB Tiffany, hon?
JACOB Scissor cut, tight on sides, get him some texture up top, take off about...
JACOB He touches Cal's hair, measures it between his fingers.
CAL Eww.
JACOB ...
JACOB inch off the top.
TIFFANY Yes, sir.
Tiffany starts chopping.
Jacob and Tiffany wait for Cal (inside a changing room).
JACOB What are you putting on?
CAL Items one, three, eleven, and fourteen.
JACOB Perfect.
JACOB You smell great by the way.
Thanks.
JACOB What are you doing tonight?
TIFFANY I don't know.
JACOB That's okay, I do.
She GIGGLES.
Cal calls out.
CAL Seriously?
CAL You just ask her out like that?
JACOB Yes, Cal, just like that.
CAL And it works?
Yes.
Yes.
CAL Crazy.
Okay, I feel kind of stupid but...
The DRESSING ROOM DOOR opens.
We TILT UP...
FROM expensive shoes, TO pants, TO fitted sweater over a fitted shirt and bright tie.
The new haircut...
A new man.
He looks...
unbelievable.
TIFFANY Wow.
JACOB Yep.
CAL Can I blouse out the shirt a little?
CAL I like to blouse out my shirts a little.
JACOB Shut up, Cal.
You'd fuck him, right?
Jesus!
TIFFANY Yeah, probably.
CAL Tiffany!
CAL You would!?
Tiffany SHRUGS.
JACOB You see that, Cal?
JACOB The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you.
JACOB Your personality is actually your weakest link.
Cal takes this in.
CAL Well, that's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me.
JACOB No, Cal.
JACOB The meanest thing
anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home -- as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover.
Cal's lower lip begins to quiver.
CAL Yeah, okay, that was meaner.
Cal sits next to Jacob.
Cal is wearing his new "outfit."
He looks great, but not yet comfortable in his new "gear."
Jacob, on the other hand, looks like he's walked out of a men's magazine.
And he knows it.
Cal looks at Jacob.
CAL I notice you only button your shirts up, like, halfway.
CAL I can't pull that off, right?
JACOB No.
JACOB Listen, Cal, I'm going to be calling women over to our table shortly.
Cal rubs his hands together, nervous.
CAL We should have some background on each other, no?
CAL I'm in insurance, more on the corporate side.
CAL My kids are --
JACOB Cal, the only thing I care less about than corporate insurance are your kids.
JACOB Here's the only thing I need to know: how many women have you been with?
CAL Sexually?
JACOB Yes.
CAL In my entire life?
JACOB No, synchronized swimming.
JACOB Yes, Cal.
JACOB Sexually.
He smiles at Jacob proudly when he has to move the count to a second hand.
Then:
CAL One.
Jacob CHORTLES.
But Cal just stares at him blankly.
JACOB Wow, okay...
JACOB wow.
JACOB Not at a time?
JACOB Total?
CAL What?
CAL I married young.
CAL We met in high school.
He smiles, remembering.
CAL Tracy was so damn beautiful.
CAL You know those women, the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once?
CAL I never knew how she did that.
CAL I still don't know how she does it.
Anyway, we had a bit of a hiccup our senior year but we made it --
JACOB Cal, I literally stopped listening at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go.
CAL I miss my wife.
JACOB Shut up, Cal.
A YOUNG WOMAN slides into the booth at Jacob's side.
YOUNG WOMAN Hi.
JACOB Hi.
JACOB Jacob Palmer.
YOUNG WOMAN Amy Johnson.
Don't.
He pulls it back.
-- Weaver.
JACOB Can I get you a drink, Amy?
35 A DRINK 35 gets handed over to: a NEW GIRL, on a NEW NIGHT.
JACOB Tell me about yourself.
JACOB What do you do?
NEW GIRL Does it really matter?
JACOB It does to me.
She looks up.
He looks completely earnest, repeats:
JACOB It does to me.
JACOB PAN TO CAL: just sitting there watching, horrified.
Now with NEWER GIRL.
NEWER GIRL And that's when I started writing the column for LA Weekly.
NEWER GIRL God, how long have I been talking?
Listen, I'm going to be honest: it's getting late and I think you're interesting.
I also think you're one of those rare women who manages to be both wildly sexy and incredibly cute all at once.
ON CAL Mouth agape.
ON CAL That was his line!
JACOB Let's get out of here.
JACOB I know it's forward of me but just...
JACOB I think we should get out of here.
She thinks, then NODS.
NEWER GIRL Okay.
JACOB I think we should get out of here.
NEW GIRL Okay.
JACOB I think we should get out of here.
Okay.
38A BACK TO CAL 38A waving goodbye awkwardly as Jacob leaves with each of the girls (IN QUICK CUTS).
Finally:
Cal just sits there, completely alone.
But then A PRETTY GIRL arrives at his table.
Cal looks up, smiles.
She smiles back, then:
She drops THE BILL on the table.
She's a waitress.
And he's been left with the tab.
Robbie Weaver sits at his 8th grade desk.
In the b.g., we hear a FEMALE TEACHER drone on about The Scarlet Letter.
Under his desk, Robbie is TEXTING.
40 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - JESSICA 40 receiving the text.
ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN The text: "Hi, Jessica.
ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN FYI: Demi Moore is 15 yrs older than Ashton K. They seem really happy.
ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN Love, Robbie."
ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN did you know Demi Moore starred in the movie version of The Scarlet Letter?" Her phone BEEPS a third time: "She shows boob :-)"
ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN She SIGHS.
Pleased with himself.
The FEMALE TEACHER drones on in the b.g.
TEACHER While Hester is forced to wear a scarlet `A' as punishment for adultery, Reverend Dimmesdale's `A' is self-inflicted --
ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN The text: "Robbie: please stop.
ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN U r making me very uncomfortable."
BACK TO SCENE Robbie stares at the screen, crestfallen.
TEACHER Mr. Weaver?
TEACHER Are we interrupting?
Robbie looks up: the WHOLE CLASS is staring at him.
TEACHER Mr. Weaver!
Slowly, Robbie stands.
We HEAD IN TIGHT ON him.
ROBBIE You want to talk about The Scarlet Letter, Mrs. Thompson?
ROBBIE Here you go: the `A' they're both wearing -- I think it stands for ASSHOLE.
ROBBIE Wanna know why?
ROBBIE Because they're in love, and love is for stupid ASSHOLES.
ROBBIE So thanks for choosing this book, Mrs. Thompson, because this is what I need right now: to read a boring, confusing book about a bunch of stupid assholes who fell in love, like assholes, and then had to die, like assholes.
ROBBIE I'm sorry for cursing.
Tracy works at her desk.
A KNOCK at her door interrupts.
A TALL MAN (40's) stands there: DAVID JACOBOWITZ.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ You have a second?
TRACY Oh, David.
TRACY I'm just a little swamped right now so...
He closes the door behind him.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ You've been avoiding me.
TRACY No, I haven't.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ You ran away in the other direction when you saw me coming down the hall yesterday.
You're very fast by the way.
She SIGHS, gives up.
TRACY I ran track in high school.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ That must be it.
He turns serious.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ I'm sorry about you and Cal.
TRACY Thank you.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ I'm also not sorry, if I'm being completely honest.
I want to make sure you know how much I like you.
TRACY No, I do --
DAVID JACOBOWITZ A lot.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Just to clarify.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ I like you a lot.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ I had no intention of falling for a married woman.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ I just wanted someone to go to lunch with who didn't make me want to shoot myself in the face.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ But we started having lunch, and talking, and suddenly I was an accountant who was popping out of bed in the morning, excited to get to work.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ That doesn't happen to accountants.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Ever.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ I've checked with other accountants.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ So when the time is right for you to get back out there again, officially, I just...
DAVID JACOBOWITZ I'd like to throw my hat in the ring.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Officially.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ That sounded weird.
Tracy LAUGHS lightly, leans forward.
TRACY David, you've been a great friend to me.
TRACY And you were the first man in a very long time to make me feel...
TRACY noticed, I guess?
TRACY What happened between us that night...
TRACY it meant something to me.
TRACY You weren't the only one excited to come to work lately.
David smiles.
TRACY But now, when I see you, all I see is his face.
TRACY All I see when I look at you is what I did to my marriage.
She's losing it, wipes her eyes.
TRACY You see this?
TRACY I'm saving you from disaster, David, `cause you're asking to pre-board the Titanic.
TRACY Honestly, do you really want any part of this?
TRACY Before he can answer...
TRACY BUZZ!
TRACY It's Tracy's phone.
Your son's school on two.
Tracy quickly picks up phone.
As she talks, David scribbles something on a postcard, EXITS.
Right, okay.
No, I understand.
Of course, right away.
She HANGS UP, looks at the Post-It.
It reads, simply:
"Yes."
Tracy looks up, but David is gone.
Robbie sits, waiting.
Tracy EMERGES.
TRACY Yes, of course.
TRACY Absolutely, Principal Sapienza, it won't happen again.
She closes the door behind her, looks to Robbie.
TRACY Seriously?
ROBBIE Sorry.
She SIGHS.
TRACY It's been a rough couple of weeks, you deserve a freebie.
TRACY C'mon, I have to get back to work.
They walk out together.
TRACY They still make kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh?
Robbie NODS.
TRACY You'd really think someone would have written something better by now.
Robbie wheels around in an office chair as Tracy tries to work behind her desk.
He stops, noticing a PHOTO.
It's an older picture of CAL AND TRACY.
They look happy.
Very much in love.
Tracy notices.
TRACY Guess I should take it down, huh?
ROBBIE I guess.
Tracy NODS.
She places the picture face down gently.
She tries to return to her work, but can't.
TRACY How is he?
TRACY I've spoken to him but only about bills, or you kids, but...
TRACY how is he, really?
Robbie hesitates.
TRACY Sorry, that's unfair.
TRACY Ignore me, I'm almost done here.
She turns back to her work.
After a beat:
ROBBIE He's dressing a lot better.
ROBBIE Going out a lot.
TRACY Oh.
TRACY Well, good.
TRACY That's...
TRACY really good.
TRACY We'll get take-out for dinner tonight, okay?
TRACY Think about what you're in the mood for.
Robbie hesitates, then adds:
ROBBIE He's sad.
ROBBIE He looks better, but...
ROBBIE sadder, too, I think.
ROBBIE You know?
TRACY Yeah.
TRACY I guess I'm pretty sad, too.
ROBBIE I know.
TRACY You do?
ROBBIE I heard you crying the other night and...
ROBBIE I didn't know what to do.
ROBBIE I'm thirteen years old and...
ROBBIE can you just tell me what I'm supposed to do in that situation?
ROBBIE I didn't want to Google it.
TRACY Oh God, baby, you're so much like me it's scary.
TRACY You wound up with all my stuff, Robbie.
TRACY I'm so sorry.
ROBBIE I'm okay with being like you, Mom.
ROBBIE I like you.
She puts down her pen.
Smiles sadly at Robbie.
TRACY It's my fault, what happened with your father.
TRACY It's grown-up stuff that I can't talk about but...
TRACY it's my fault.
TRACY Not his.
TRACY So just...
TRACY be good to him, okay?
ROBBIE It'll be okay, Mom.
You promise?
He NODS, the most soulful thirteen-year-old ever.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Hey, they need you in the conference room for a sec...
DAVID JACOBOWITZ oh, sorry.
They look up.
It's David.
Tracy gathers herself, stands.
TRACY David, this is my son, Robbie.
TRACY Robbie, this is David.
We work together.
Robbie takes him in, shakes his hand.
TRACY I'll be right back, okay, honey?
Okay.
Okay.
Awkward.
Really awkward.
Tracy starts to say something, thinks better of it, and EXITS.
David moves into the room, sits down opposite Robbie.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ So, Robbie...
DAVID JACOBOWITZ I hear you're quite the soccer player.
ROBBIE So, David...
ROBBIE I hear you broke up my parents' marriage.
He LAUGHS awkwardly, shocked.
ROBBIE You are David Jacobowitz, right?
ROBBIE From accounting?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Um, yes I am --
ROBBIE Here's the thing, David: in the end, she winds up back with my dad.
ROBBIE He's better than you, in every category except probably math.
ROBBIE And she still loves him.
Robbie props the PHOTO of Tracy and Cal back up.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Listen, Robbie --
Now I know what you're thinking: `he's just in 8th grade, what does he know about love?' I know a lot more than you think, David.
Just today, I had a meltdown, almost gave up on the love of my life.
My dad's having his meltdown now, but long-term?
He won't stop fighting for my mom any more than I won't stop sending Jessica texts that make her uncomfortable.
And you need to know that.
Tracy RE-ENTERS.
TRACY You ready to go?
Mommy, can we do Chinese for dinner tonight?
Tracy waves to David as she and Robbie EXIT, leaving him stunned in the middle of her office, staring at:
THE PHOTO OF CAL AND TRACY that Robbie has left directly in his line of sight.
Bushes rustle.
Once, then twice.
It's Cal, sneaking into the backyard.
He takes a covert look inside the house.
All is quiet.
He gets to work.
-- He spreads FERTILIZER on the grass.
-- Trims some bushes.
-- Picks off some petals from some dying flowers.
It's the strangest goddamn thing you've ever seen.
Finally, he finishes.
ON CAL Content.
ON CAL His yard may not be his anymore, but it's back in order.
ON CAL As he takes it all in...
ON CAL Cal DIVES into a SHRUB.
Another night at the bar: Cal's in his position, Jacob in his.
Cal sips his drink, staring aimlessly forward.
Jacob looks at Cal.
Cal looks great, more comfortable in his new "skin" than when we left him.
He's drinking a martini, rather than a red-strawed vodka cranberry.
A WAITRESS passes.
Without speaking, Cal taps the rim of the glass, silently requesting a refill.
It's a cool, practiced move...
and he did it instinctively.
Jacob smiles, leans forward.
JACOB I think you're ready, Cal.
CAL For what?
JACOB To talk to a woman, take a woman home.
CAL Oh, no.
CAL No, I'm not.
JACOB You've been watching me do it for two weeks.
CAL Yeah, well, I've been watching LeBron James for years, doesn't mean I can suddenly dunk a basketball.
JACOB Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually building blocks for throwing and blocking punches?
CAL Oh God.
CAL Are you going to make me fight someone?
Jacob stretches his neck, trying his patience:
JACOB Cal, what's the first thing I do when a woman sits down?
CAL You ask if you can buy her a drink.
JACOB And what if she says no?
CAL You order her a drink anyway, let it sit there.
JACOB When she asks me a question about myself?
CAL You deflect it back to her.
CAL You never answer questions about yourself.
JACOB And what happens?
CAL They talk about themselves.
CAL A lot.
JACOB And what do I do?
CAL You act really interested.
CAL You nod a lot.
JACOB And at the end of the night?
CAL You compliment them, then you ask if they'd like to come back to your place.
JACOB Do I ask?
CAL No.
CAL You confidently tell them you'd like them to come back to your place.
Holy shit!
You Mr. Miagi'd me!
Jacob BOWS to Cal, Japanese style.
A PRETTY WOMAN stands near their table.
Jacob stands, smiles.
JACOB Oh, and no talking about your job, your children, your pathetic sexual history, or David Jacobowitz.
JACOB Okay, here we go...
CAL What, no, I'm not ready for --
CAL Hi!
JACOB Cal, this is Kate.
JACOB Kate, Cal.
Jacob NODS at Cal ("you've got this") and leaves them.
Kate SITS.
Cal smiles at Kate, nervous.
She smiles back.
Cal MOTIONS for a waitress in the distance.
CAL Can I buy you a drink, Kate?
Oh.
No thank you.
Cal smiles, portrays confidence.
CAL I'm buying you a drink anyway, Kate, so you might as well tell me what you want.
KATE Really, thank you but it's okay.
CAL I'm guessing you're a vodka girl, am I right?
CAL Yeah?
CAL A nice dirty martini?
CAL No, no, no: a Grey Goose, rocks, extra lime?
CAL C'mon, one drink!
CAL Picture those ice cubes clinking together.
CAL Mmmm.
CAL Can't you taste it?
She smiles.
KATE Yes, I can but...
KATE I'm, uh, five years sober so...
Cal's face drops.
The WAITRESS approaches.
WAITRESS What can I get --
CAL Nothing.
CAL We don't want anything.
CAL Don't come back here ever.
The Waitress leaves, confused.
Kate looks around, uncomfortable.
She tries small-talk.
KATE So...
KATE what do you do, Cal?
CAL What do you do, Kate?
KATE I asked you first.
CAL I asked you second.
She LAUGHS lightly, thinks he's being funny.
KATE Seriously, what do you do?
CAL Seriously, what do you do?
Now it's getting a little weird.
KATE I'm a teacher.
KATE Now, c'mon: what do you do?
Cal NODS, exaggerated.
CAL Teacher.
CAL Interesting.
CAL I'm very interested in teaching.
KATE I'm sorry, are you not going to tell me what you do?
He's still nodding, as if fascinated.
CAL A teacher with an alcohol dependency no less, I bet that's actually more common than people realize...
KATE I should get back to my friends --
Kate STANDS.
Cal puts his face in his hands.
CAL I'm sorry!
CAL I'm supposed to deflect your questions...
CAL oh screw it: I'm in corporate insurance.
CAL And I have children.
CAL Plural.
CAL More than one.
CAL The only thing I have ONE of, is sexual partners, that would be the woman I recently separated from because she was cheating on me with David Jacobowitz who I wasn't supposed to tell you about either.
Kate turns back, curious.
KATE What were you supposed to tell me?
CAL I don't know: that you're a perfect combination of sexy and cute -- it was something I said about my wife that's since been corrupted.
CAL But I'm tired, and I'm at least fifteen years older than you, and this sweater is called slim fitting but it's really just uncomfortable and itchy.
KATE You think I'm a perfect combination of sexy and cute?
Cal looks up.
CAL That's what you took away from that?
She smiles, sits back down.
KATE Wow, an actual honest man.
KATE I don't know what to do with that.
KATE It's kind of...
KATE rare around here.
It's nice, actually.
CAL It is?
KATE You have no idea.
KATE I'm kind of a magnet for these jerk-offs.
KATE They charm me, and I fall for it, and at some point they just...
KATE never call me again.
I don't understand.
Look at you.
Who wouldn't call you again?
She looks up.
It's not a line, it's a genuine compliment.
She smiles warmly.
Holy shit, Cal is in!
KATE So...
KATE what were you `supposed' to do next?
CAL Well, eventually I'm `supposed' to ask you if you want to get out of here.
CAL Actually no, I'm supposed to tell you, confidently, that you should come home with me.
KATE Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens?
Cal looks up, surprised.
He clears his throat, then:
CAL You're very pretty, Kate.
CAL And I can't tell if you're being serious, but I think you should come home with me.
Ask me again.
Cal smiles and leans forward, faux-confident.
CAL I'm not asking you, Kate.
CAL I'm telling you: you should come home with me.
CAL CUE MUSIC: "SEXYBACK" by Justin Timberlake.
Cal and Kate BARGE in, passionately kissing.
CAL This is my dumpy apartment that I had to move into when I left my wife.
I love that you're being so honest.
It's so different, so hot.
CAL I've never been with a woman besides my ex-wife.
KATE More, tell me more.
CAL I'm worried you have AIDS.
She stops.
CAL Only a little.
She pushes him down on the couch, takes her sweater off.
She's wearing just a bra.
She looks amazing.
KATE What do you want to do with me?
CAL Show you off to my wife to make her jealous.
She GROWLS and dives on top of him as we launch:
-- The next morning a DISHEVELED CAL lets Kate out, gives her a big passionate kiss, and closes the DOOR.
-- We STAY ON the DOOR.
After a beat, it opens up: as Cal bids farewell to a NEW GIRL on a new morning.
Cal strides in -- a skip in his step, a perfectly tailored suit on his body.
Everything's in SLOW MOTION.
He points at someone, winks at a waitress...
A SAD SACK GUY at the bar watches Cal stride by, jealous.
Cal Weaver has evolved into "the fucking man."
1) HANNAH studies late into the night for the bar.
2) JESSICA reads magazine articles on "How to Make Him Notice You."
3) TRACY eats ice cream in bed, alone.
4) ROBBIE drags mysterious wood planks into his backyard.
But we're mainly with CAL...
A NEW WOMAN EXITS.
The door closes.
It re-opens as he kisses goodbye ANOTHER WOMAN!
52 BACK AT THE BAR -- CAL AND JACOB 52 are mid-conversation.
JACOB ...
JACOB it would work!
CAL You're out of your mind.
JACOB What do college guys hate?
JACOB Doing laundry.
JACOB What do they love?
JACOB Strippers.
JACOB It's a strip club where they can do their laundry.
CAL It's ridiculous.
JACOB And yours isn't?
JACOB A candy store that only sells red candy.
CAL Everyone loves the cherry.
CAL Look, I'm not rejecting the psuedo- cherry flavors like raspberry or strawberry, anything in the -erry family is allowed.
CAL But let's be real here: no one wants the lemon.
CAL No one likes the grape.
JACOB I like grape.
CAL Well then you can't come to my store.
They LAUGH, quickly becoming inseparable.
A late 40s couple eat dinner: BERNIE (the big guy who "broke up" with Cal earlier) and CLAIRE, a bubbly little woman -- the polar opposite of her husband.
CLAIRE Oh, I almost forgot -- heard some good gossip at the nail salon.
BERNIE For God's sake, Claire.
It's about Cal.
BERNIE Leave the poor bastard alone, would you?
BERNIE I gave him the cologne like you told me to.
BERNIE We don't have to dance on his grave.
VOICE What did you hear about Mr.
VOICE Weaver, Mom?
CLAIRE Apparently, Mr. Weaver has become quite a man-about-town if you get my drift.
JESSICA What?
CLAIRE Lots of young women coming in and out of his apartment lately.
BERNIE Claire, would you cut it out?
CLAIRE It's good for Jess to know.
CLAIRE She still baby-sits for him after all.
BERNIE Oh, c'mon!
BERNIE Enough.
CLAIRE Well, it's good gossip at the least.
CLAIRE Ooh, guess what else I heard...
Jessica waits at her LOCKER.
She spots a TALL BLONDE GIRL moving down the hallway, texting as she walks.
JESSICA Madison!
JESSICA Madison, wait!
Madison stops walking, but not texting.
JESSICA Hey, I had a question --
Madison holds up a finger ("one second") and continues texting.
Finally, she stops.
Looks up.
Smiles.
MADISON Hey, Jessica, whassup?
JESSICA I had a question for you, Madison.
JESSICA It's kind of on the personal side so...
MADISON My lips are...
Madison extends her arms, begins clapping and making WEIRD NOISES.
Jessica stares at her blankly.
Seals.
My lips are seals.
JESSICA Oh, okay.
JESSICA So, Madison, here's the thing...
JESSICA I don't mean to be blunt or insulting but, let's call it what it is: you're always sleeping with older guys, right?
Always.
JESSICA Lots of college guys, I've heard.
MADISON Lots of them.
JESSICA Even rumors about a few teachers.
MADISON Totally.
JESSICA So my question is: how do you do that?
JESSICA I mean, how do you get them not to see you as...
JESSICA well, a kid in high school?
MADISON Oh, well first off, I have a huge rack.
JESSICA You do, yes.
MADISON So that helps.
JESSICA Yes, I'm sure it does.
MADISON You don't have a huge rack.
JESSICA No, I don't unfortunately.
MADISON So that's not gonna work.
JESSICA Nope.
Madison SIGHS.
MADISON Okay, here's what you do.
MADISON Wait, how old is he?
JESSICA Old.
MADISON Like really old?
JESSICA Like parent old.
MADISON Nasty.
MADISON Rock on, Jessica.
JESSICA Thank you, Madison.
MADISON Alright, you have to hook him.
MADISON Force his hand.
MADISON Make him unable to stop himself from doing what he knows to be wrong.
JESSICA How?
MADISON Do what I do.
MADISON Send him a postcard from downtown.
JESSICA Huh?
MADISON Go TMZ on his ass.
JESSICA I'm not following you, Madis--
MADISON The full gyno.
Off Jessica's blank look.
MADISON A crotch shot?
MADISON A nip slip?
A dirty picture!
You can even Annie Leibowitz it.
Tasteful but with nipple.
Yeah, that's what you should do: make it artistic.
Black and white.
Make this face.
She makes a raw sexual face.
JESSICA Jesus, Madison!
MADISON Well, you came to me for advice, that's my advice.
MADISON You put those across his radar, he won't see you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure.
Madison walks off, calls back.
MADISON Don't send it to him as a jpeg, though.
MADISON He'll put it up on his fantasy football web-site.
MADISON And then your brother sees it, tells your mom, and suddenly you're not allowed to use Facebook for a month.
MADISON Thanks, Kevin!
Jessica EXITS the school, lost in thought.
There's a bit of commotion outside.
TEENAGERS are pointing and LAUGHING at something.
Jessica pushes through and sees:
ROBBIE, standing atop a man-made, tall, wooden platform/scaffold in front of the school.
There she is!
ON JESSICA Oh shit.
as he RIPS OPEN his button-up shirt, revealing a SCARLET J taped to his pale, hairless chest.
He has recreated the famous Scarlet Letter tableau.
He pulls out a piece of paper, reads it.
ROBBIE Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in The Scarlet Letter: `No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.'
Robbie puts down the paper, ignoring the jeers.
ROBBIE I am not bewildered!
ROBBIE Jessica Riley is my soulmate.
ROBBIE She's the one!
ROBBIE I know it to be true, and so now do the multitude.
Multitudes?
No, multitude.
JESSICA Robbie, get down!
ROBBIE I have marked myself with this Scarlet J, Jessica!
ROBBIE For you.
ROBBIE Because your name starts with a J.
ROBBIE It's just tape and construction paper but one day I will get a permanent tattoo when I'm old enough that my parents won't freak out on me.
JESSICA Robbie Weaver!
JESSICA I am your baby- sitter and I'm telling you to GET
That does the trick.
He gets down to mocking APPLAUSE.
Jessica pulls him off to the side.
What the hell are you thinking?
ROBBIE You like the scaffold?
ROBBIE It has wheels.
ROBBIE Took four weeks to build it.
Oh, those are my friends, they helped me wheel it down.
Wave hello.
OFF TO THE SIDE: Three excited THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLDS WAVE and give THUMBS-UPS to Robbie.
Jessica waves, confused, turns back to Robbie.
JESSICA This has to stop, Robbie.
JESSICA Seriously.
ROBBIE You'll learn to love me.
ROBBIE I promise.
JESSICA I won't.
ROBBIE Just because I'm four years younger than you?
This stops Robbie dead in his tracks.
JESSICA I've been spending time with him for a while.
Robbie stumbles, less sure-footed than usual.
ROBBIE No.
ROBBIE You can't.
ROBBIE I've checked.
ROBBIE No boyfriend since ninth grade.
ROBBIE No date for Spring Formal last
JESSICA He's older.
JESSICA I don't want my parents to know.
JESSICA It might be the cutest thing you've ever seen.
ROBBIE Who is he?
JESSICA It doesn't matter.
ROBBIE Do I know him?
ROBBIE Is he from town?
JESSICA I don't know.
JESSICA Yes, kind of.
ROBBIE I'll kill him if he hurts you.
Jessica tries not to smile.
JESSICA I know.
JESSICA But this all has to stop now, Robbie.
JESSICA The speeches, the texts, all of it.
JESSICA It's very sweet, but it has to stop.
He just sits there, lost.
JESSICA I'll see you around, okay?
She EXITS.
Robbie remains seated on the grass.
Devastated.
His three friends approach.
We should probably get the scaffold back on the road before dark.
ROBBIE Yeah.
Robbie's on the couch, dejected.
His little sister sits next to him, watching High School Musical as always.
In the adjoining kitchen, Cal is on the phone.
Hey, Nanna!
I know, it's been forever.
Have you been getting out at all?
I'll bring you some of that deli you like one night, okay?
The kids?
They're fine.
Kids, say hi to Nanna.
Hi, Nanna!
CAL Oh, I've been keeping busy.
CAL Made a new buddy, I've been spending time with him.
CAL Yeah, I'm going to see her tomorrow night.
CAL Of course I miss her.
CAL You don't know how much I miss...
His voice cracks.
He turns, sees Robbie staring.
He heads into the bathroom with the phone, closes the door.
Robbie SIGHS, turns back to the TV.
Cal and Robbie are having a catch.
Robbie is listless.
ROBBIE So you're seeing Mom tomorrow, huh?
ROBBIE At my parent-teacher thing?
CAL Yeah.
ROBBIE First time in a while.
CAL Yeah, but no biggie.
Cal tosses him back the ball.
CAL Hey, what's with the moping?
ROBBIE Nothing.
ROBBIE It's just...
ROBBIE there's this girl.
Cal smiles.
CAL Oh yeah?
CAL You like her?
ROBBIE I like Pringles.
ROBBIE This girl's my soulmate.
ROBBIE I'm like crazy, stupid, in love with her.
ROBBIE And she wants someone else.
CAL But she's your soulmate?
ROBBIE Yeah.
CAL Well you can't just give up.
ROBBIE Why not?
ROBBIE You did.
Cal freezes.
ROBBIE Mom was yours, right?
CAL I didn't give up.
ROBBIE Listen, Dad.
ROBBIE I love you.
ROBBIE I have your back, always.
ROBBIE But let's be honest here: the woman told you she wanted a divorce and you jumped out of a car.
CAL It was slightly more complicated than that.
CAL And I'm a different guy now.
ROBBIE You're the same guy.
ROBBIE You just have different clothes.
ROBBIE Do you still love her?
CAL How old ARE you?
Do you still love Mom?
Cal doesn't say anything.
His silence speaks volumes.
CAL Weren't we talking about you?
ROBBIE We are.
ROBBIE Your son is in desperate need of some romantic inspiration.
ROBBIE So set an example for your boy.
ROBBIE Don't give up.
ROBBIE It's complicated?
ROBBIE Uncomplicate it.
ROBBIE She says no?
ROBBIE Change her mind.
ROBBIE Look at you, you're the man right now, Dad.
ROBBIE Get her back.
Get back my mom.
Robbie punctuates his pep talk by tossing Cal the ball, hard.
Cal is lost in thought.
The ball sails past him and THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby car.
PARENTS walk hand-in-hand, into the school.
It's Parent- Teacher conference night.
Cal sits on a small chair outside a classroom.
Tracy approaches.
TRACY Wow.
Cal looks up.
Tracy stands there.
She's dressed down, but looks amazing.
Vulnerable and nervous.
You look great, Cal.
CAL Oh, well turns out I've been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so...
TRACY Well you look great.
TRACY Really.
Cal smiles.
CAL Thank you.
You always look great, so...
Awkward.
Neither knows what to say now.
Tracy takes the seat next to him.
CAL I talked to Nanna yesterday.
TRACY Me, too.
TRACY She sound okay to you?
CAL She sounded like...
CAL Nanna.
CAL She worries about us.
Tracy NODS.
A long beat, then:
CAL I feel like I'm about to get detention.
Tracy LAUGHS, tension broken a bit.
CAL Which teacher is this?
TRACY Mrs. Thompson.
TRACY This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on.
Cal smiles.
CAL He's a really weird kid, isn't he?
TRACY Yeah.
I kind of like him, though.
CAL I do, too.
CAL I'm so glad we switched the babies at the hospital.
TRACY Me, too.
They LAUGH.
God, these two are great together when they're in rhythm.
The laughter trickles away.
An awkward beat, then:
CAL So, how are things with...
CAL How's it going with David?
She looks down.
TRACY Oh...
TRACY it's not.
It wasn't about him, if that means anything.
CAL No, I know.
Cal looks at his watch, a nervous gesture.
TRACY You seeing anyone?
CAL Who, me?
CAL No.
CAL You know me.
CAL No, not really.
TRACY Oh.
TRACY Because you hear things, you know.
CAL Yeah, well...
Another long beat of silence.
Cal gathers himself, takes a breath, and turns toward Tracy.
CAL I miss you, T.
Tracy looks up surprised.
CAL I got complacent, I think.
CAL You find your soulmate in high school...
CAL you've got the game sewed up in the first quarter, you know?
She smiles.
CAL I put in an effort when we were younger, didn't I?
CAL I'd do anything to make you happy: take you miniature golfing, dancing -- you were such a good dancer.
TRACY I had to be.
TRACY You were such a good miniature golfer.
He smiles, emboldened.
CAL All I ever wanted to do was make you love me.
CAL And then you did, really early on.
CAL And we got married so young.
CAL And I guess...
CAL I got lazy.
CAL I got boring.
CAL And I'm furious at you for what you did.
CAL But I don't totally blame you, if that makes any sense?
I shouldn't have jumped out of the car.
I should have fought for you.
You fight for your soulmate.
At least that's what our thirteen- year-old tells me.
Tracy's eyes well up with tears.
TRACY He's a very strange boy, isn't he?
CAL I'll be honest: he scares the shit out of me.
She LAUGHS through her tears.
TRACY I missed you, too.
Cal takes her hand, kisses it.
VOICE Mr. and Mrs. Weaver?
They turn around.
It's Robbie's English teacher, Mrs. Thompson...
better known to us as:
KATE (the teacher from the bar who Cal slept with).
Cal freezes, his lips on Tracy's hand.
CAL Oh God.
KATE Cal?
KATE What are you doing here?
CAL Really?
TRACY You two know each other?
CAL Um, yes...
CAL we've met before.
KATE We've met before?
KATE Seriously?
CAL Mrs. Thompson?
CAL This is my wife.
CAL Tracy.
KATE Oh, so now she's your WIFE again?
Kate's getting louder now.
CAL Why don't we head inside?
She STORMS INSIDE.
Tracy looks at Cal, follows her in.
Kate PACES in front of the classroom.
I'm sorry, I'm playing catch-up: how do you two know each other?
KATE Maybe your husband should tell you.
Cal hesitates.
CAL We have a mutual friend.
KATE Ha!
CAL You know, maybe we should focus on Robbie?
KATE Yes, let's do that.
KATE Let's focus on Robbie.
KATE As you know, Robbie's shining moment this year was when he set a school record for cursing in an eighth grade English class.
She writes on the board: ASSHOLE.
She underlines it.
KATE Asshole.
KATE Are you familiar with this word, Mrs. Weaver?
CAL She's heard it, yes.
CAL So in terms of Robbie's progress --
KATE Asshole: as in, someone who tells a woman that he'll call, and never does.
CAL We were a little concerned about Robbie's grade on his oral book
KATE Asshole: as in, someone who uses `honesty' to get a woman into bed with him, but is actually full of shit like the rest of them.
CAL Because usually he's a very strong public speaker --
KATE Asshole: as in, someone who allows a woman to go down on him for forty-five minutes because he's `nervous' --
Kate stops.
Cal turns to Tracy.
She looks crestfallen.
CAL I can explain.
Tracy rushes out of the room.
Cal calls after her.
CAL She's an alcoholic!
CAL You can't trust what she says!
KATE SCREAMS in horror.
Cal races after Tracy.
Kate races after Cal.
A three-way chase:
CAL Tracy, wait!
TRACY Leave me alone, Cal!
KATE I'm sober for FIVE YEARS, you
TEACHERS and PARENTS (including Jessica's parents), stepping out into the hallway and following them outside.
Tracy races to her car.
CAL Tracy, c'mon!
CAL We were separated.
TRACY I know, and I cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you.
CAL Okay, so --
TRACY I can't do this now, Cal.
CAL Tracy, I love you.
KATE Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute,
ASSHOLE! Tracy looks at Cal, stunned.
ASSHOLE! That's their thing.
CAL It's a funny story, actually --
TRACY I'm going home.
She opens the car door.
CAL Tracy, wait!
CAL Yes, I slept with her!
CAL I slept with our son's eighth grade teacher!
GASPS from the crowd.
Claire (Jessica's Mom) takes a picture with her cell phone.
CAL But all it did was confirm what I already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU!
Tracy hesitates.
Cal seizes the moment.
CAL Before, you were the only woman I'd ever been with or wanted to be with.
CAL And now, even after I've been with eleven women, you're
He instantly trails off, realizing.
MORE GASPS.
...
the only woman I want to be with.
TRACY I don't even know who you are.
Tracy gets in her car and speeds off.
CAL I'm your soulmate.
CAL By a SLAP ACROSS the face by Kate.
CAL She STORMS OFF.
THUNDER CRACKS in the sky.
It begins to pour.
Cal stands there, soaked.
He looks up at the sky.
Meanwhile, the rain pours down as DINERS scurry into the restaurant.
We've been here before...
the same group of BORING PEOPLE at the same table.
Liz and Hannah CHAT off to the side.
There's a cake on the table that says "CONGRATS HANNAH!"
Richard stands on a chair.
RICHARD Excuse me, everyone.
RICHARD Everyone!?
The room goes quiet.
RICHARD Now, if we could get our guest of honor over here...
RICHARD I forget what she looks like, anyone remember?
POLITE LAUGHS.
Liz GAGS herself with her finger, looks at Hannah.
Hannah takes a deep breath, downs her drink, and walks over to Richard.
Is this it?
RICHARD I'm so proud of you, baby.
RICHARD I had my doubts, of course...
More CHEESY LAUGHTER.
RICHARD Now I did tell you that it'd be a special night when you passed the bar.
RICHARD And I'm a lawyer so you know I never lie...
More HECKLING from the crowd.
Liz desperately orders another drink, barely able to take it.
RICHARD So, Hannah, I'd like to formally ask you, in front of all our friends and colleagues...
Hannah waits, frozen.
RICHARD ...
RICHARD if you'd like to become a permanent lawyer at the firm of Watkins, Goldberg, and Schmidt!?
CHEERS.
Hannah steps back, breathless.
Richard reacts.
RICHARD You don't have a better offer already, do you?
Everyone LAUGHS.
HANNAH No, that's great.
HANNAH I just...
HANNAH I'm sorry, I thought...
HANNAH I thought you were about to propose.
The room goes quiet, trying to hear.
RICHARD What?
HANNAH No, I just...
HANNAH it's fine.
HANNAH I'm sorry, I just got thrown is all.
Richard pulls Hannah off to the side.
RICHARD Honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize.
HANNAH No, no, don't be silly, it's fine.
RICHARD It's definitely a possibility, down the road.
RICHARD I think I just need a little more time.
RICHARD I'm still figuring out how I feel about us, you know: long-term.
HANNAH No, I know...
Wait -- you're figuring out how you feel about us?
She LAUGHS.
Once.
Then twice.
Loudly.
Everyone's now watching.
Liz gets a good seat, excited.
RICHARD Honey?
She's really laughing now.
HANNAH You know what the best part is: I would have said yes!
HANNAH To YOU!
HANNAH And I didn't even want you to propose!
HANNAH Just now, I swear to God: I was hoping you wouldn't propose.
HANNAH And I still would have said YES!
HANNAH That's how pathetic I am!
She snags someone else's drink from the table, DOWNS IT.
She grabs Richard's cheeks.
HANNAH I will consider your job offer, thank you so much, Richard.
Meanwhile, Jacob sits alone in the bar.
He checks his watch.
No Cal.
Suddenly, he looks very alone at his usual table.
He shakes it off, stands, and approaches the table of a group of nearby WOMEN.
One of them is telling a story:
WOMAN And you know what she said?
JACOB What?
JACOB What did she say?
The women look up.
ON JACOB Standing there, in all his glory.
ON JACOB He flashes his coolest smile.
ON JACOB They melt.
ON JACOB We've seen this before.
SLAM!
The door to the bar busts open, revealing:
HANNAH. She's dripping wet from the rain, looking almost wild.
She scans the room, quickly, searching for...
She spots him, marches straight to him.
For the first time, he looks like a deer in the headlights.
She grabs him.
Kisses him.
A long, deep, almost angry kiss.
She pulls back.
HANNAH Do you remember me?
JACOB Yes.
HANNAH Do you still think I'm attractive?
JACOB Yes.
HANNAH Do you still want to take me home?
JACOB Yes.
Hannah NODS, takes his hand.
HANNAH Let's go.
She leads him out of the bar.
We STAY WITH the WOMEN Jacob had just been introducing himself to.
Slut.
We haven't been here yet.
It's exactly what you'd expect though: an elegant bachelor-pad.
Modern furniture.
Sleek.
Everything just right.
Jacob puts an album on his record player.
HANNAH This place looks like something out of a men's magazine.
JACOB Is that a compliment?
HANNAH I'm not sure.
Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones.
HANNAH I like this song.
JACOB I thought you would.
Drink?
HANNAH Yes, please.
HANNAH He pats the couch.
HANNAH Hannah nods, walks over, sits down.
JACOB Cheers.
HANNAH Cheers.
HANNAH Jacob raises a brow, pours her another.
HANNAH This time she HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it.
HANNAH As soon as she finishes choking...
HANNAH So is this how it normally works?
JACOB What?
HANNAH How you woo a woman?
HANNAH You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink?
JACOB Yes.
JACOB That's how it normally works.
Hannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig.
HANNAH And then you sleep with them?
JACOB Yes.
HANNAH So that's what happens next?
HANNAH We sleep together?
JACOB At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan.
She takes a deep breath, admits:
HANNAH I'm very nervous.
JACOB I'm getting that.
HANNAH I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic.
Jacob LAUGHS.
He actually LAUGHS.
JACOB You're adorable.
Hannah SNAPS, already tipsy.
HANNAH No!
HANNAH Not adorable!
HANNAH Sexy!
HANNAH R-rated sexy!
HANNAH Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens...
HANNAH but that's not why I'm here!
I'm here to bang the hot guy from the bar who hit on me.
JACOB I don't think people say `bang' anymore.
HANNAH I do.
HANNAH We're going to bang.
HANNAH I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me!
Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up.
HANNAH Okay, okay, this is happening.
Take off your shirt.
JACOB What?
HANNAH I need to stop thinking.
HANNAH Take off your shirt.
Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off.
He's ripped.
HANNAH Holy crap.
She pokes a finger at his abs.
HANNAH It's like you're photo-shopped.
JACOB Now take off yours.
HANNAH No way!
HANNAH Not with all that happening...
She motions casually at his abs.
HANNAH So...
HANNAH do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom?
In the bedroom is preferable.
Hannah stands, a girl on a mission.
HANNAH Good.
HANNAH Let's go there.
Meanwhile Cal, beaten up and soaking wet from the rain, ENTERS.
He looks to his usual table, in need of a friend's company.
But Jacob isn't there.
Hannah lies on her back in the dim light.
Jacob is on top of her, shirtless.
They're making out, gently.
This pillow is amazing.
It forms perfectly to the shape of my head.
JACOB I'm glad you like it.
They resume kissing.
After a beat, she pulls back again.
HANNAH Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone?
Off his look...
HANNAH They are, aren't they!?
HANNAH I always wondered who actually buys them!
HANNAH You do!
HANNAH The hot guy from the bar buys them!
HANNAH Of course!
She shakes her head, amazed.
Gathers herself.
HANNAH Sorry, let's proceed.
Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her...
she pulls back again.
HANNAH You don't have one of those ridiculous massage chairs, do you?
No.
HANNAH Oh.
HANNAH My.
HANNAH God!
HANNAH You totally do!
I do.
She STARTS LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.
It's infectious.
HANNAH How much did it cost?
JACOB Five thousand doll--
JACOB We watch him as he realizes that.
JACOB As he processes it.
JACOB We watch him look at Hannah.
ON HANNAH Hair in her face: drunk, laughing, completely amazing.
And then...
Jacob does the most unexpected thing:
JACOB Do me a favor.
JACOB Ask me a question about myself.
HANNAH What?
HANNAH No!
HANNAH I don't want to know anything about you.
JACOB C'mon, one question.
HANNAH Okay, fine, but then we bang.
JACOB Absolutely.
JACOB Now, come on, I'll answer anything.
JACOB You can ask me about my job, or past
HANNAH What's your mom like?
The question takes him by surprise.
He hesitates, then:
JACOB Icy...
JACOB I guess?
JACOB Not cruel, but cold.
JACOB Very cold.
HANNAH And your father?
JACOB He died, long time ago.
JACOB Left us a lot of money, which is how I have...
He motions at his PILLOW.
JACOB Stuff like this.
She motions at his abs.
HANNAH And time for stuff like that?
He LAUGHS.
JACOB My dad was the opposite of my mom, actually...
JACOB TIME PASSES, as one question leads to another, and then another.
JACOB -- Soon they're sitting in bed, sharing the Scotch from the bottle, just talking.
JACOB Then kissing.
JACOB Then lying on their sides, face-to-face, talking some more.
JACOB Hannah who covers him with a blanket, and kisses him on the forehead, and begins falling in love with him.
CUE MUSIC as we begin a...
Hannah looks longingly at Jacob's plate of pancakes.
He notices, switches plates.
She smiles.
He smiles.
God, he's crazy about her.
He looks at the next table, watches a LOVELORN GUY switch plates with his GIRLFRIEND.
Uh-oh.
DOLLY DOWN the row, HANDS are held between COUPLES, all entranced by the movie, until we REVEAL:
JACOB staring down at his hand, locked with Hannah's.
JACOB He looks terrified.
Now it's Hannah who's asleep in bed, and Jacob who stares at her lovingly.
Suddenly, he catches himself.
In a series of COMEDIC JUMP-CUTS, he wrestles with the implications of what's happening to him.
-- Pacing.
A drink.
A big drink.
Fingers pulling at his own hair.
Hyperventilating.
More staring.
More pacing.
And finally, he loses the battle: he tucks Hannah under a blanket, kisses her forehead, and finally...
Gives in to falling in love with her.
Cal is sitting at the table that once belonged to Jacob.
He suddenly seems very alone.
He looks towards the bar, notices that same SAD SACK MIDDLE-AGED GUY.
Also alone.
He picks up his cell.
Tracy sits at a table, FLOWERS off to the side.
Her phone rings.
She looks at it, sees it's "Cal."
She hits
PULL BACK to reveal DAVID JACOBWITZ, across from her.
He looks at Tracy and smiles.
She smiles back weakly.
The awkward end of a first date.
David walks Tracy to the front door.
She's carrying those same flowers.
Awkward beat.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ I had fun tonight, Tracy.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ And I was wondering if --
TRACY David, stop.
TRACY Look, I had a nice time, which is a substantial upgrade from the rest of the...
TRACY times I've been having lately.
TRACY So, I don't think I'm ready to start dating but my ex clearly is and there's a yogurt shop where they make this eight calorie ice cream that tastes like a laxative, so if you'd like to take me there sometime I guess I wouldn't say no.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Wow.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ You know, that's exactly what I was thinking.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ It's almost uncanny.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ THE DOOR OPENS.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Jessica stands there.
JESSICA Hello.
TRACY Oh, Jessica.
TRACY Hi.
TRACY Sorry.
TRACY Jessica, this is my work-friend.
TRACY (CONT'D) He's an accountant named David.
TRACY (CONT'D) David, this is my baby-sitter, Jessica.
TRACY (CONT'D) Okay, David, well everything sounds great.
TRACY (CONT'D) Spreadsheets.
David smiles knowingly.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ I'll see you at work.
He EXITS.
Tracy stands there with Jessica, awkward.
Robbie sneaks down the stairs.
From a kneeling position, he can hear and see everything.
JESSICA So...
JESSICA How was dinner?
TRACY It was just for work.
It's a pretty dress.
TRACY Oh, thanks.
Tracy reaches for her purse, awkwardly.
TRACY So how much do I owe yo--
JESSICA Did you know your kids are the only ones I baby-sit for who always want to stay awake so they can see their dad when he gets home.
JESSICA I mean, they fight with everything they have to keep their eyes open so they can hear what Dad had for dinner, or how he liked the movie.
JESSICA Lot of kids want to stay awake for Mom -- and your kids always want to see you, don't get me wrong -- but not a lot wait up for Dad.
JESSICA Maybe it's because he's good, and he's kind, and he's decent.
TRACY What are you talking abo--
JESSICA Batshit crazy.
She walks out the door.
Tracy looks confused.
TRACY Jessica?
Jessica turns, explodes?
She storms off.
TRACY Jessica!
Tracy locks the door and leans against it...
processing what Jessica just said about Cal.
She puts the FLOWERS down on the table, and heads into the kitchen.
at top of the stairs, regarding the flowers.
CUE MUSIC.
Robbie rides his bike down the street.
He's got Tracy's FLOWERS nestled in his handlebars.
Jessica ENTERS in a huff, goes right toward a drawer in her dresser.
She pulls out a CAMERA.
we watch as she: Sets it on her dresser.
Hits the timer.
Steps back.
Drops her clothes to the floor.
Prints a PHOTO from her camera.
And places it in an
"Cal Weaver."
With a heart.
She stares at the envelope for a beat.
Just then: HER DOORBELL RINGS.
Jessica jumps, started.
She quickly puts the envelope in a drawer and heads for the door.
She opens the front door.
Sitting on her stoop:
The same flowers that David Jacobowitz gave Tracy sit out front.
She looks at the note.
It reads: "Just give me a chance, love David J" but the "David J."
has been crossed out and replaced with "Robbie."
She shakes her head, takes the flowers, closes the door.
MUSIC CONTINUES as we spy the Weaver family through their windows: Robbie plays video games in his room.
Molly watching her show in hers.
Tracy in the kitchen.
We MOVE DOWN the house, and OUTSIDE, where we discover:
Cal in stealth mode, tending to his backyard.
He fertilizes, trims and waters.
All under cover of night.
TRACY Kids!
TRACY Ice cream!
Cal looks into the living room.
Tracy has brought out ice cream: a carton with three spoons.
The kids race down the stairs, join her, and start eating.
Laughing.
We take in the real-time TABLEAU:
Cal's wife and children -- his family -- inside.
Cal: watching them from the outside, looking in.
It's touching.
It's complicated.
It's horribly painful.
INSIDE...
Tracy looks at her kids, thinks of something.
She steps into the KITCHEN, closes the door, and DIALS her phone.
Cal leans toward the window, suspicious.
OUTSIDE...
Cal's phone rings.
He jumps to silence it.
CAL Hello?
TRACY Hi, Cal.
Silence.
Cal is looking at her inside.
She has no idea.
TRACY So...
TRACY I'm in the basement.
TRACY I'm trying to get the water heater working `cause the pilot's out and I don't know how to relight it.
Obviously Cal sees she's not in the basement.
TRACY I'm sorry to bother you, I just...
TRACY what do I do?
Cal lowers the phone, looks at her, hesitates.
Then:
CAL It's fine, it's fine.
CAL I'm glad you called.
CAL Here: I'll walk you through it.
Do you see the little grey door?
TRACY Yeah.
CAL Pull it down.
She pantomimes this in the kitchen.
TRACY Okay, it's down.
CAL Now, you see the red button?
CAL I wrote `push' on it?
TRACY I got it.
CAL Push.
CAL Now turn that to the right and stick the match in.
TRACY Oh, there it goes!
CAL Good.
CAL Now just close the door and you're good to go.
Silence.
The charade is over.
Now what?
TRACY Well, thanks, Cal.
TRACY I...
TRACY appreciate your help.
CAL No, anytime.
CAL Call anytime with stuff like that.
Talk to you later?
TRACY Yeah.
TRACY And...
TRACY thanks again.
Cal sits on his little couch, between Robbie and Molly.
Molly is once again absorbed in High School Musical.
Cal looks depressed.
Robbie doesn't look much better.
CAL Nanna's coming over tonight.
CAL You guys haven't seen her in a while.
CAL Wanna stay for dinner?
ROBBIE Sure.
CAL Your mom's working till five, we'll have to tell her.
CAL What do you guys want to do today?
MOLLY High School Musical.
CAL Well, there's a shocker.
She goes back into her trance.
ROBBIE She still won't talk to you?
CAL Not if that show's on.
ROBBIE No, I mean, Mom.
CAL Oh, no.
CAL Just hellos and goodbyes when we pass you guys off.
ROBBIE What happened?
CAL Beyond your pay-grade, buddy.
Cal looks pained.
CAL I will say this though: I got close.
CAL We were laughing.
CAL Talking about old times, all the things we used to do...
His eyes drift to the TV.
It's the timeless GOLF SCENE from High School Musical II.
A LIGHT BULB goes on.
Hey.
Get your coat.
Robbie smiles, runs off.
Cal turns to Molly, REMOTE in hand.
CAL Baby?
CAL I'm gonna have to turn off the show.
MOLLY No!
CAL I have to --
CAL I'm turning it off --
He just does it!
He turns the TV off.
Silence.
Molly turns towards him, stares.
A long, scary, beat.
Then:
MOLLY Thank you.
Cal talks to a SALESMAN.
Robbie and Molly bounce around, excited.
Cal talks to a different SALESMAN.
Robbie and Molly extend a MEASURING TAPE across the ground, assisting.
Cal rents a TRUCK.
Cal picks up materials.
As he rounds a corner, he runs into...
BERNIE.
BERNIE Oh, hey, Cal.
CAL Bernie.
BERNIE So how've you --
CAL Bernie: I'd love to catch up, but I'm doing something at the old house tonight and I'm in a bit of a rush so...
CAL yeah.
CAL Thanks again for the cologne.
Molly points out her three favorite DAY LABORERS, Cal hires them.
Some kind of construction is going on back there.
Cal's cell phone RINGS.
We go --
86A SPLIT SCREEN 86A with JACOB on his.
He's waiting outside a LIQUOR STORE in his car.
CAL Hello?
JACOB Hey, Cal.
CAL Oh.
CAL My.
CAL God.
CAL It's alive.
JACOB I'm sorry.
JACOB I know I've been out of circulation.
CAL You abandoned me at my time of need.
JACOB I've been a little...
JACOB things have gotten a bit...
JACOB I met a woman.
CAL I bet you did.
JACOB No, I mean, I've been spending a lot of time with her.
JACOB This woman.
JACOB One woman.
Okay, whatever.
JACOB Actually, tonight...
JACOB I'm going to meet her mother.
Whoa!!!!
Look at you!
You do realize you might actually have to answer a question or two about yourself?
JACOB Yes, I realize that, asshole.
Hannah comes out of the wine store, hops over the car.
Jacob can't help but smile: wow, he's REALLY into her.
JACOB Gotta go.
JACOB Grab a beer next week?
CAL You've got my number.
Hey.
Good for you, by the way.
JACOB Thanks.
Tracy pulls up to her house.
As she pulls in she notices Robbie.
He's standing outside the front door in a tuxedo...
a shit-eating grin on his face.
She SIGHS ("what now?") and parks the car.
Meanwhile.
Claire is putting away laundry.
She throws some underwear in Jessica's bottom drawer.
Notices something.
An envelope.
It's addressed to Cal Weaver.
Curiosity piqued, she picks it up.
Looks inside.
Almost faints.
Big Bernie sits in a recliner, watching football and drinking a cold one.
Jessica lies on the floor, doing homework.
Claire ENTERS, ashen.
Zombie-like, she hands Bernie the envelope.
Jessica looks up, sees it.
JESSICA No!!!!
Staring at the picture.
We don't see it, but we get the point: it's a father's worst nightmare.
Bernie, dazed, slides the pictures back into the envelope.
He looks at the envelope again.
Cal's name.
A heart.
JESSICA Daddy?
Bernie puts a hand up.
He can't speak.
He marches out the door.
From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY.
ON JESSICA Realizing.
ON JESSICA She grabs a second set of keys.
Jessica runs into a second car.
Races after her father.
Meanwhile.
Tracy approaches Robbie.
Not only is he wearing a tuxedo, he's carrying a bunch of SCARVES.
Tracy LAUGHS.
TRACY Baby!
TRACY What are you wearing!?
ROBBIE Dad's here.
Tracy's face drops.
ROBBIE I have to blindfold you.
What is this?
What is he doing?
ROBBIE Relax, Mom.
ROBBIE He's your husband, not Al Queda.
ROBBIE You'll make it out alive.
ROBBIE He ties a SCARF around her eyes.
ROBBIE Then ANOTHER at a different angle, double-knots it.
ROBBIE Then ANOTHER!
ROBBIE Okay, we're good, let's do this.
Meanwhile.
There's no expression on Bernie's face.
It's frightening.
He looks down at passenger seat.
At the ENVELOPE bearing Cal's address.
He RACES through a light.
A HORN blares behind him.
Jessica is the one BLARING THE HORN, crying and panicked.
She too RACES through the same light.
Robbie leads a blindfolded Tracy into the backyard.
She looks like a zombie with all the scarves over her face.
We see what she is not yet privy to.
Cal's Shangri-La has been transformed: the yard holds a FULL-BLOWN MINIATURE GOLF HOLE, windmill and all.
Cal stands behind it all, in a tux.
CAL Hi, T.
TRACY Can I take these off, please?
CAL Almost.
CAL Kids?
Robbie CUES music (which will play throughout this scene).
Molly, in a PARTY DRESS, carries a glass of champagne to Tracy and puts it in her hand.
Twenty-five years ago, Cal Weaver saw Tracy Boyle for the first time, walking the halls of Woodside Middle School --
TRACY Cal: are you seriously doing this in front of the kids?
If it goes bad I'm supposed to take Molly upstairs and put the TV on loud.
Tracy SIGHS, giving up.
TRACY Well, might as well wait for your daughter.
CAL She's right next to you, T.
TRACY No, your other daughter.
Huh?
Just then:
VOICE Hello?
From inside the house steps out...
CAL Nanna!
HANNAH Hi, Daddy.
WTF!
And right behind her...
JACOB.
Holding a bottle of wine and smiling like an idiot.
Everyone freezes.
JACOB Cal?
CAL What the hell are you doing here?
JACOB What the hell are you doing here?
HANNAH Wait, you two know each other?
Hi, Nanna.
CAL Wait, what's going on?
ROBBIE Hey, Nanna.
HANNAH Hey, Robbie.
MOLLY Hey, Nanna.
HANNAH Hey, cutie.
HANNAH It's me, I couldn't pronounce Hannah when I was little -- wait, so how do you know my dad?
Oh, God.
HANNAH Dad, this is my boyfriend, Jacob.
CAL No.
CAL No.
CAL No.
CAL No.
TRACY I want to see the boyfriend!
Can someone please take this off?
HANNAH So you two, like, really know each other?
CAL No way -- you and her...
CAL no way.
CAL End it, now.
HANNAH Daddy!!!
JACOB Well, that's not going to happen.
CAL Well, then I'm going to murder you.
TRACY Will someone please take this goddamn thing off me!
CAL Robbie, take the goddamn thing off your mother!
CAL Bernie?
SLAM!
A body flies into Cal and knocks him OUT OF FRAME.
It's Bernie!
Behind him...
JESSICA runs after her father, SCREAMING:
JESSICA Daddy, no!
ROBBIE Is that Jessica?
BAM!
Bernie lands a solid right into Cal's jaw.
HANNAH Daddy!
JESSICA Daddy!
What's happening?
Bernie is pummeling Cal.
Jacob dives in.
Tries to pull Bernie off.
Bernie NAILS Jacob with an UPPERCUT!
HANNAH Jacob!
Bernie, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
Bernie picks up a WINDMILL from the miniature GOLF COURSE, readies to bash it over Cal's head.
Jessica throws herself on Cal.
JESSICA Daddy, stop!
This breaks Bernie's trance.
He hesitates.
JESSICA He didn't do anything.
JESSICA He doesn't even know.
ROBBIE Know what?
CAL Know what?
Robbie, please get this off me!
ROBBIE I'm TRYING!
JESSICA He doesn't even know that I'm in love with him!
Robbie stops, turns.
ROBBIE With who?
JESSICA With him.
CAL Are you pointing at me?
ROBBIE Are you pointing at him?
TRACY Who is she pointing at!?
Wait: my dad is the older guy you've been seeing?
BERNIE I knew it.
He gets ready to pummel some more.
Jessica grabs him.
He doesn't even know about the dirty pictures I made for him.
ROBBIE You made him dirty pictures?
ROBBIE Oh God.
Robbie looks to Cal.
He's angry, jealous, and broken- hearted all at once.
You're the one?
You're the one she...
You stole my soulmate.
CAL Wait: Jessica is your soulmate?
VOICE I'm sorry, is Tracy home?
Everyone turns: DAVID JACOBOWITZ stands in the doorway.
He's holding up a SWEATER in his right hand.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ You left your sweater in my car the other night.
HANNAH Who are you?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ David Jacobowitz.
JACOB David Jacobowitz!
CAL David Jacobowitz!?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ Is this a bad time --
WHACK!!!
Jacob LEVELS David Jacobowitz with a right hook.
HANNAH Jacob!
JACOB You know how much misery you've put this poor bastard through!?
Before Jacob can finish, Cal LEVELS Jacob.
CAL Stay the hell away from my daughter.
Jacob JUMPS on Cal.
David jumps on Jacob.
Bernie tries to pull them apart.
Jessica finally gets the blindfold off Tracy.
The women and children watch the battle in horror.
Cal, Jacob, Bernie, and David Jacobowitz sit side-by-side on the miniature golf hole, bloodied but still.
REVEAL: TWO POLICE OFFICERS standing in the center of the yard.
One of them finishes writing in a pad.
POLICE OFFICER #1 Well, okay.
POLICE OFFICER #1 That should about do it.
POLICE OFFICER #1 What do you think?
The other cop SHRUGS.
The first cop, thinks, then:
POLICE OFFICER #1 Look, I'm just gonna write domestic disturbance reported but all clear, okay?
POLICE OFFICER #1 `Cause honestly, I don't even know what to put down here.
TRACY Thank you, Officer.
He nods, walks to the door.
Stops there.
POLICE OFFICER #1 Just...
POLICE OFFICER #1 simmer down, okay?
POLICE OFFICER #1 We all have arguments, but if you're gonna fight -- just do it inside.
POLICE OFFICER #1 Keep it in the family, okay?
Jacob SNARFS down a laugh.
Cal glares at him.
CAL I'll kill you.
Awkward silence.
Our whole cast is there: disheveled and bloodied.
The place looks like a hurricane has hit.
A miniature golf hole torn to shreds.
Bernie turns to Jessica.
BERNIE Let's go.
BERNIE Now.
She NODS.
Looks back at Cal.
JESSICA I'm so sorry --
And that's that.
Robbie runs to the driveway, looks:
96 IN THE STREET 96 as Jessica runs after her father, trying to apologize.
But he won't even look at her.
They get in their respective cars, drive off.
Jacob approaches Cal.
CAL Don't.
CAL -- Cal turns to Hannah.
CAL This man is a lowlife and a
TRACY Oh, that's ironic.
Cal whips around.
CAL I'm sorry, what?
CAL You may not be able to see it, but I have.
CAL Over and over again.
CAL You are not to see him any more.
HANNAH Dad, c'mon, I'm not going to stop seeing him.
Cal turns away.
CAL Well then I don't have anything else to say to you.
ON HANNAH shocked.
TRACY Cal, stop being unreasona--
CAL I said: GET THE HELL OUT OF MY
This time it's Tracy whose face registers shock.
Hannah takes Jacob's hand, pulls him away.
JACOB Cal, c'mon --
But Cal won't even look at him.
Goodbye, Nanna.
Goodbye, cutie.
They EXIT.
Cal lets them go, then grabs his things.
CAL She's all yours, David.
Ouch.
Nice.
Before he goes, Cal stops in front of Robbie.
CAL Go big or go home, right, buddy?
Robbie looks up at him, cold.
ROBBIE Go home, Dad.
CUE: John Mayer's "Who Says."
1) ROBBIE, at school.
His spirit is crushed.
He looks at his CONTACT LIST, thinks, and DELETES JESSICA.
2) at home, grounded and sad.
3) trying to get HANNAH to make a phone call to her father...
she won't.
4) at her office, finally taking down the picture of her and Cal.
And speaking of Cal...
Cal sits back at his usual table.
This isn't "Cool Cal," the Jacob disciple.
No, this is "Sad Mess Cal."
He's grown a patchy beard.
He's wearing a ratty sweatsuit.
He's drinking, once again, vodka-cranberry out of a wimpy red straw.
It's pathetic.
A WAITRESS APPROACHES.
WAITRESS Can I get you another?
CAL What time is it?
WAITRESS 2:30.
WAITRESS In the afternoon.
CAL 2:30 would have been sufficient but I appreciate the judgment, Cocktail Waitress.
Yes, another drink would be grand.
She EXITS.
Cal feels bad for that one.
As she re-approaches:
CAL That was uncalled for.
CAL Sorry for being a dick.
JACOB Ah, it's okay, I deserved it.
ON JACOB Standing there.
ON JACOB As always, he looks perfectly put together.
ON JACOB He takes in Cal.
JACOB It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal.
CAL What do you want?
JACOB Can I sit?
CAL I don't know, can you?
JACOB Okay, are we going to be mature about this, or act like children?
`Are we going to be mature or act like children?'
JACOB Okay, so like children then.
JACOB Move over.
Jacob SLIDES in.
JACOB I'd like to talk.
CAL You still seeing my daughter?
JACOB Yes.
CAL Then I have nothing to say to you.
JACOB Cal.
Cal, look at me.
Cal looks.
Jacob still has that power over him.
JACOB You been hanging out here a lot?
CAL Sometimes.
JACOB Must be missing a lot of work.
CAL I have a lot of vacation days.
JACOB Some vacation.
CAL I hate the beach...
CAL you've got a lot of nerve coming here --
JACOB You want a sip?
CAL No, she probably spit in it.
Jacob NODS as Cal pushes the drink away.
JACOB Your kids miss you.
CAL You're hanging out with my kids, fantastic!
CAL You can teach Robbie how to objectify women, he'll love that.
JACOB His eighth grade graduation is next week.
JACOB You coming?
CAL Of course I'm coming.
JACOB Well you haven't exactly been around for him, Cal.
CAL He's not my biggest fan right now.
JACOB Oh, that's a good excuse --
CAL Alright, man-whore, if your lecture on parental responsibility is almost done --
JACOB I love her, Cal.
Cal looks up.
JACOB I've never been in love before.
JACOB Honestly, I've never even been in `like' before.
I never got it.
I saw people in love -- I saw weakness.
I heard them say the things they said, and do the things they do, it all just seemed so...
so pathetic.
JACOB (CONT'D) She's my perfect combination of everything, Cal.
Cal looks up at Jacob.
He smiles, gently.
CAL I know you.
CAL I know what you are.
CAL You are not good enough for my daughter.
CAL And you will never have my permission nor my approval.
Jacob stands.
JACOB I'll see you at graduation.
A small MIDDLE-SCHOOL AMPHITHEATER.
About 150 people fill the crowd of an intimate middle school graduation.
Tracy, Molly, and Hannah sit in the front row.
Jessica sits with her family a few rows away.
All look nice.
Sits Cal, sandwiched between RANDOM SPECTATORS.
Cal is now shaven and well-dressed but he looks miserable.
His eyes brighten for a moment as he notices...
AN EMPTY SEAT between Tracy and Hannah.
He leans forward, are they saving it for him?
But just then...
Jacob arrives.
Kisses Hannah and takes "Cal's" seat.
Cal looks nauseous.
We WATCH the ceremony for a moment.
The PRINCIPAL labors through her introduction...
...
and now, to introduce the first student speaker: our very own English teacher Kate Thompson!
Cal's former conquest steps onto stage.
Tracy looks away, clearly uncomfortable at the teacher's presence.
She accidentally catches Cal's eye.
Awkward.
KATE Our next speaker is not only the class salutatorian, but he's also one of the most...
Spirited...
young men, I've ever had the pleasure of teaching.
Ladies and gentlemen: Robbie Weaver.
Robbie takes the stage to APPLAUSE.
This is not the same kid we've come to love.
There's something different in his face.
He's been broken.
He spots JESSICA.
ROBBIE Thank you, Mrs. Thompson.
ROBBIE Welcome, Class of 2011.
I wasn't really sure what I wanted to talk about today.
Mrs.
Thompson said it might be good to talk about growing up and getting older and stuff.
So I guess I'll talk about that.
Cal watches, concerned.
Where's his son?
ROBBIE I grew up a lot this year, I think.
ROBBIE I used to think that growing up meant really growing.
ROBBIE Like getting taller and bigger.
ROBBIE But now I think that growing up just makes you smaller.
ROBBIE Your dreams get smaller, and what you want gets smaller...
ROBBIE I grew an inch and a half this year, but I feel a lot smaller.
Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned.
ROBBIE I was in love.
ROBBIE And I know that makes parents laugh because I'm only thirteen but whatever, I was.
I believed that there was one true love for everyone, and if you fought for that person, your one true love would always work out.
But that's not how it works.
It sounded good when I was younger, but...
it's just not how it works.
There's no such thing as one true love for everyo--
CAL Stop!
Robbie turns.
Cal is STANDING in the middle of the crowd.
Everyone turns to look at him.
ROBBIE Dad?
CAL Hi.
CAL Hi, everyone.
Silence.
No one knows what to do.
Cal is suddenly really uncomfortable.
CAL May I have a word with my son?
CAL It'll just take a second.
CAL Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family.
Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down.
What are you doing?
CAL I don't know.
CAL What are you doing?
Robbie's eyes well up with tears.
ROBBIE I was wrong, Dad.
ROBBIE There's no such thing as --
Cal turns toward the crowd, announces:
CAL My son's graduation speech sucks.
GASPS from the crowd.
ON CAL Now standing, alone, front and center in front of an entire eighth grade graduation ceremony.
He looks behind him at the panel of TEACHERS.
MRS.
THOMPSON discreetly gives Cal the finger.
CAL In fairness, I don't know where he was going but I think we can all agree it was heading in a pretty depressing direction.
CAL And I basically wrote it for him.
CAL I mean, I didn't literally write it but I sure as hell influenced it, and the kid's already a spitting image of his mother and I'll be damned if this is what he's going to get from me.
People squirm, uncomfortable.
This is a train wreck.
CAL My son -- not him, my actual son -- he believes in grand romantic gestures.
CAL He believes that people have soulmates.
CAL And we always want to tell our thirteen-year- olds that they're wrong, that `one day you'll understand, young man.' But maybe it should be the other way around.
He looks at Tracy, out in the crowd.
CAL I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old.
CAL Our first date, we went for ice cream.
CAL After, my dad started teasing me about my `first date' the way dads do.
CAL And I told him: `stop making a big deal, Dad.
CAL I'm going to go on lots of dates with plenty of girls.' That was the first time I ever lied to my father.
CAL (CONT'D) I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old.
CAL (CONT'D) And I have loved her with everything I have for every minute, of every day, ever since she let me buy her that first mint chip ice cream.
CAL (CONT'D) I have loved her through the birth of our three perfect children, and I have loved her even as I've hated her -- only married couples can truly understand that one.
CAL (CONT'D) And I don't know what will wind up happening with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm sorry I can't give you that -- but I promise you this: I will never stop trying.
CAL (CONT'D) When you find `the one' you never give up trying...
CAL (CONT'D) and I love you, my amazing boy, for reminding me of that.
Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts.
Cal kisses his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone.
Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces:
ROBBIE I still love you, Jessica!
ROBBIE I've loved you since the first time you changed my sister's diaper!
ROBBIE I've loved you since...
The ceremony is over.
Robbie heads over to his family.
They hug him, kiss him.
Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob.
CAL Hi, Nanna.
HANNAH Daddy.
He smiles at her, adoring.
CAL My perfect girl.
CAL I already ordered a gun.
CAL I'm not kidding.
CAL I ordered a Colt .45 on a shady internet site, I can show you the receipt.
CAL If you hurt her, I am prepared to shoot you in the face.
JACOB Cal, I'm not going to --
CAL Shut up, Jacob.
Jacob shuts up.
CAL Wow.
CAL I like that.
Jacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal.
Cal notices:
CAL Is that a new shirt?
JACOB Hannah took me to the Gap.
JACOB It's actually not as bad as I thought.
CAL Seriously?
JACOB Of course not, Cal.
JACOB It's the Gap.
JACOB I got this at Nordstrom's.
And like that...
order is restored in the universe.
Who approaches Jessica.
ROBBIE It was nice of you to come.
JESSICA I wouldn't have missed it.
Awkward.
ROBBIE So, how are things with your dad?
JESSICA Strained.
JESSICA I took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna head up there early.
JESSICA Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while.
ROBBIE Yeah, probably a good idea.
You were a good baby-sitter, Jessica.
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.
He holds out his hand, to shake, formally.
JESSICA Wait: I thought you weren't giving up.
ROBBIE I'm not.
ROBBIE But I figure: you like my dad, and one day I'll look like my dad, so I'll just come for you then.
Jessica smiles.
JESSICA It's a good plan.
She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse.
JESSICA Until then: a little graduation gift.
JESSICA To help get you through high school.
JESSICA Robbie peeks inside.
JESSICA His eyes BUG OUT.
JESSICA Jessica kisses him, sweetly, on the cheek.
JESSICA You take care, Robbie.
Robbie watches her go.
Love-struck once more.
Cal steps up next to his son.
CAL You okay, buddy?
I am now, Dad.
I am now.
Robbie runs off to join his friends.
Cal smiles.
TRACY I'm terrified of what's going to become of him once he hits puberty.
Cal turns, Tracy has been watching.
CAL We might have to lock him up.
Tracy smiles.
Cal walks over toward her.
TRACY You gave a good eighth grade graduation speech.
CAL I've been working on it for thirty years, so...
She LAUGHS, then...
quiet.
TRACY Do you think we can ever come back from all this, Cal?
CAL I don't know.
CAL I'd like to try though.
CAL I know I'd like to try.
She nods, thinking.
TRACY Things are just so messed up.
TRACY And it's been such a strange year.
TRACY I've been in such a strange place.
TRACY And we have all these problems, so many problems I've lost count, but at the end of the day, I mean, the only thing I know --
She stops herself, emotional.
Then, simply:
TRACY I am just so glad you took me for that ice cream.
Cal smiles.
They share the moment in silence.
And then:
TRACY It was rocky road by the way.
CAL No!
CAL Off to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and watches them enjoy one another's company.
He smiles.
