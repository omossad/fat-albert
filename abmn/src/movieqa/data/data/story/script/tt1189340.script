July 8, 2006
MICKEY HALLER, 40, lawyer-- TIGHT on him, as morning light flies across his features.
He's fresh-shaved, neat suit, gazes out with a stark/steady focus from the back seat of--
GRADUALLY FADE IN, under the SOUND of rain & freeway, his DRIVER, black, 20s, low patter to which Mick barely listens--
EARL I'm thinkin', when Not-Guilty- Two gets to four thousand miles, that's two cars ready, that's enough to start the airport runs...
EARL You gettin' any of this, Mr.
EARL Haller?
EARL Not this morning.
EARL Mick watches the rain without seeing it.
MICK Just keep your speed up, Earl.
MICK Earl kicks it, passes cars...
MICK Mick takes a FILE from a stack beside him.
MICK Also laptop, cell- phone rack: His back seat is his rolling office.
MICK Opens the
file.
Top sheet: THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA v.
LOUIS ROULET.
Tight on Mick.
His eyes see back to the be innin CUT TO,
The town car sails along, bright glint off the surface streets-- We HEAR HARD RAP, TUPAC SHAKUR-- CELL PHONE RINGS--
MICK Earl-- buds.
MICK A command.
MICK Earl puts in earbuds, Rap cuts out.
MICK Into cell--
MICK (CONT'D) This is Haller.
Where are you this morning?
This time Mick's in a mussed suit, surrounded by newspapers, open files, electric shaver, take-out coffee...
MICK On my way to Lancaster for a calendar call.
MICK Why, have you got something?
I got a franchise player is what.
Reaction Mick: He's heard it before...
VAL'S VOICE I mean it, this guy could be money.
VAL'S VOICE But he goes before the judge at eleven.
MICK Van Nuys by eleven could be hard--
VAL'S VOICE But this client, listen Mick, his mother's lawyer just waltzed in
MICK He's already got a lawyer?--
VAL'S VOICE Strictly real-estate, doesn't know his ass about criminal.
VAL'S VOICE Will you listen?
VAL'S VOICE Guy waltzes in, ready to put up the family's beach house in Malibu against the million in bail...
MICK A million?
MICK What'd they book him on?
VAL'S VOICE He picked up a girl last night-- Whatever went down she ended up pretty bad.
VAL'S VOICE Cops want Aggravated Assault with G.B.I.--
MICK Has the D.A. filed yet?
VAL'S VOICE No.
VAL'S VOICE See?
VAL'S VOICE I'm giving you ground floor.
VAL'S VOICE So make it work for me, Mick.
VAL'S VOICE Don't let him use the house, get him to go for my bond-- Meanwhile the Lincoln's approaching the Lancaster courthouse, there are cars, people-- a traffic jam.
VAL'S VOICE To Earl--
MICK Bring me around to the employee's gate, I'll talk my way in.
MICK I'm at the courthouse.
MICK Give me the name.
VAL'S VOICE That would be Louis Roulet...
R-O-U-L-E-T, like the wheel.
MICK That's not how you spell the wheel but I got it, thanks.
VAL'S VOICE Remember: I steered him to you.
MICK You're on my Christmas list, Val.
MICK Lincoln swings abruptly to a steel gate.
MICK "EMPLOYEES."
MOVING with Mick through the press of lawyers, others, before the Judge shows up, as a few PRISONERS are led into the holding pen-- Mick picks out his client, HAROLD CASEY, 30s, lanky, with a ponytail and skull & halo tattoo...
Mick tries catching his eye but Harold's clearly avoiding him...
MICK Harold.
MICK Hard Case.
Don't hide from your lawyer, Harold, you know what I want to talk about.
Caught, Harold slouches towards him.
MICK (CONT'D) Listen.
MICK (CONT'D) when the judge comes in he's going to want to know if we're ready for trial...
HAROLD We are.
MICK We're not and you know why not.
MICK You haven't paid me.
MICK Rule one, remember Rule one, Harold?
MICK I get paid or I don't work.
HAROLD Don't worry, I have your money...
MICK Right, you have my money, I don't.
HAROLD It's coming.
HAROLD I talked to my boys.
MICK Harold-- I looked at the list of people I trust, and you know what?
MICK You're not on it.
HAROLD The law says you can't just quit.
HAROLD The Judge won't let you.
HAROLD I looked it up.
HAROLD Mick's about to react to this jailhouse lawyering-- when a hush falls, and the JUDGE comes out: ORTON POWELL, 60...
MICK Pay close attention, Harold.
MICK Goes to his seat...
Harold's case has been called, Mick stands--
MICK Mickey Haller for the defense, your honor.
MICK If I may, I'd like to carry this over.
JUDGE ORTON Do you have a reason, Mr. Haller?
MICK I'm having trouble locating a witness, your honor.
MICK An indispensable witness.
MICK A Mr. Green.
MICK With emphasis.
MICK A look goes between the Judge and Mick.
MICK Meantime Harold stares from the pen.
MICK The Judge, to Mick--
JUDGE ORTON How much time do you need?
JUDGE ORTON Would a week be enough?
MICK I hope so, your honor.
MICK As your honor knows, Mr. Green can be hard to track down.
MICK A look of understanding.
MICK Judge nods--
JUDGE ORTON I'm holding this over pending notification from counsel...
JUDGE ORTON Then gavels down, for the next case-- As Casey's led off, Mick joins him along the rail-- He hisses--
HAROLD That was bullshit, askin' for a delay-- I know what that was about.
MICK And so does Judge Powell.
MICK He spent a lot of years as a defense lawyer, so he knows all about having to chase "Mr.
MICK Green," and he doesn't look kindly on defendants who don't pay their attorneys.
MICK Now do you get it, Harold?
MICK Casey won't look him in the eye-- RAP MUSIC IN AGAIN, TUPAC'S
The black town car cruises south, past dry brown hills...
Earl, unasked, puts in his buds, as Mick answers the call--
MICK This is Haller.
LORNA'S VOICE And this is your office.
It's a one-bedroom in Studio City, Lorna's 33, redhead, pretty as hell, works at her kitchen table in her bathrobe, among breakfast dishes...
MICK Actually I'm in my office.
MICK On my way to court in Van Nuys.
LORNA That means Val reached you about his customer.
MICK Oh yeah: "This is the franchise, Mick."
MICK According to Valenzuela every case is "the franchise."
MICK I'd have paid my mortgage ten times over by now--
LORNA It could be he's right.
LORNA I ran the name, the family's got a real estate business in Beverly Hills.
LORNA The Times has them down for some big house sales, movie-star dollars...
Sounds like the media might be interested.
Call Sticks, tell him to show up.
Any other calls?
LORNA A couple of DUI's, I quoted them the house number.
LORNA That's it, you're free after Roulet.
MICK Good.
MICK Then I can go to County lock- up.
MICK Under which Mick sees Earl indicate something on the road...
MICK while Lorna reacts to what Mick said, exasperated...
LORNA You're going to see Gloria.
LORNA Why do you waste time on her, Mickey?
LORNA Mick sees where Earl's pointing: SQUAD OF MOTORCYCLES,
HARLEYS, IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRRORS...
They pull up alongside: gang jackets, black leather vests...
Big guys...
EARL Want me to do somethin' about this?
EARL 'Cause I can.
MICK Ignore them, you're doing fine.
MICK FACE OF THE LEADER OF THE MOTORCYCLES, leers at Mick through
window, as Mick ignores, answers Lorna re "Gloria":
MICK (CONT'D) What can I say, Lorn, I've got a soft spot for redheads.
MICK (CONT'D) Why do you think I married you?
LORNA The divorce papers called it temporary insanity.
MICK Lucky for you there was a cure.
MICK When-- Earl interrupts, insistent now--
EARL Mr. Haller?
EARL Calling his attention to-- THE MOTORCYCLES HAVE PULLED IN FRONT.
EARL The leader signals Earl to pull off.
EARL Mick sees they're surrounded.
EARL Shit.
The Lincoln follows the Harleys off, PULLS TO A STOP in a lot at the crest of the exit.
Jagged rocks, craggy peaks.
The leader gets off his bike.
EDDIE VOGEL, nearly 300 lbs.
Skull & halo patch on leather vest-- same as Harold's tattoo.
The "Road Saints."
Mick lowers a window.
EDDIE Counsellor, how's it hanging?
MICK Fine, Eddie, how's it with you?
Hard Case called me from the pen, he said I might catch up to you.
Said you're stalling his case til you see more green, is that right?
MICK If you want me to work you've gat to pay me.
EDDIE We paid you.
EDDIE Five thousand.
MICK That's long gone.
MICK I could tell you half went to the aerial-photo expert.
MICK He's going to blow the state's case by showing that the DEA violated the air space over Harold's farm by flying too low...
MICK but you don't need to know that.
MICK All you need to know is, we had a deal.
MICK Time to refill the tank.
MICK Eddie smiles.
MICK Taps the side of the Lincoln.
EDDIE Sure, gas-guzzler like this.
EDDIE I heard you got three more.
EDDIE What's one man need with four Lincolns?
EDDIE What?
EDDIE You want another five grand?
MICK Ten.
MICK I'm flying the guy in from Kodak in New York, he wants business class...
EDDIE And I want Harold back on the farm.
EDDIE He's the best farmer we got, if you know what I mean...
MICK I don't.
MICK And I don't want to.
MICK Either pay me my money or go with the Public Defender the judge finds you.
MICK Of course he won't know much about air space, but--
EDDIE Keep your shirt on, Counsellor.
EDDIE We want you.
EDDIE He reaches into a vest with his big hand.
EDDIE Thick envelope.
Mick takes it.
Starts to count, and realizes:
MICK You had the whole ten ready.
MICK What if you'd backed me down to five?
EDDIE This vest got lots of pocket.
EDDIE Eddie taps another pocket and GRINS.
EDDIE one tooth missing.
CAMERA MOVING ON: EIGHT MEN, prisoners in grey jumpers.
Six are black.
Of the two white men, one's a wet-eyed, skanky JUNKIE, 40s.
The OTHER is a tall young man, somehow polished even in prison outfit, definitely out of place here--
MICK Louis Roulet?
MICK LOUIS turns: the proverbial deer-in-the-headlights: Scared.
MICK (CONT'D) My name is Michael Haller.
MICK (CONT'D) I had a call.
LOUIS Yes-- Mr. Haller-- Mick stands behind a painted line three feet from the cell.
LOUIS Signals Louis to come to the bars to talk.
LOUIS Louis approaches,
LOUIS (CONT'D) I-- called you because I need
MICK You want me to represent you for your first appearance.
MICK I get twenty- five hundred for that.
MICK We can work out what comes next.
LOUIS Thank you-- This is a set-up, Mr.
LOUIS Haller-- I made a mistake with that woman, she was setting me up--
MICK Keep your voice down.
MICK And don't say anything about the case, not til I've got you out on bail.
MICK Okay?
MICK Mick's voice, as always, is easy and calm.
MICK Louis nods.
MICK (CONT'D) I understand your family lawyer's in court?
LOUIS That's him.
LOUIS Cecil Dobbs.
LOUIS Points to-- DOBBS, balding dignified WASP, a few rows in.
MICK Is he ready to post bail?
LOUIS He'll do whatever he has to.
LOUIS Mick nods, noting the tinge of desperation in Louis's voice.
LOUIS Takes out a notebook...
MICK Okay, tell me about yourself.
MICK How old are you?
LOUIS Thirty-two...
MICK Ties to the community?
MICK You grow up here, go to school?
LOUIS Both.
LOUIS Beverly Hills, UCLA.
LOUIS I work for my mother's business...
MICK "Windsor Estates?"
LOUIS It's named for her second husband.
MICK How much did you make last year?
MICK If I'm going to get you out I need to know everything.
LOUIS My taxes last year said four hundred thousand.
LOUIS Just then, the White Junkie lurches forward towards Mick--
I want a lawyer too, you got a card?
MICK They'll have one for you out there.
MICK I need you to back up and leave us alone.
MICK Can you do that, pal?
MICK Junkie backs off, does just what Mick says.
MICK Impressing Louis.
MICK Then Mick, low-voiced--
MICK (CONT'D) Listen.
MICK (CONT'D) They've put some heavy charges on you.
MICK (CONT'D) The DA will probably ask for No-Bail...
LOUIS No bail?
LOUIS Frightened voice, the others react, Mick hushes him, and...
MICK I said they're going to ask it.
MICK When was the last time you were arrested?
LOUIS Never.
MICK So if I checked your record--
LOUIS --you'd find parking tickets.
LOUIS Mick looks briefly into the younger man's eyes-- he's scared, fragile -- but sincere.
LOUIS He sputters--
LOUIS (CONT'D) This whole thing is--
MICK We're not talking about the case, remember?
MICK Not even to the judge.
LOUIS Don't I even say "Not guilty?"
MICK Today's about setting arraignment, period.
MICK You say nothing.
LOUIS Are you going to get me out?
MICK I'm gonna try, Louis.
One more thing: There are lots of lawyers.
Why pick me?
LOUIS I..
LOUIS remembered your name from some case in the papers...
MICK What case?
LOUIS A drug case, I don't know.
MICK You remember the name or anything?
LOUIS No-- but you got the evidence thrown out against some guy-- Does it matter?
LOUIS I need your help, Mr. Haller.
LOUIS Off Mick, GO TO,
Right eye bruised, swollen shut.
Nose broken.
Bloody gauze protrudes from her nostril.
Lip cut and swollen like a plum.
Gash over the right eye.
Fear in her expression...
Studying it is ASSISTANT D.A. MAGGIE McPHERSON, 30s.
We're:
Maggie's in a navy suit, raven-black hair: smart and strong and a beauty.
Coming up behind her--
MICK Are you the prosecutor who used to have the Roulet case?
MICK She starts to smile-- until his emphasis registers.
MAGGIE Don't tell me.
MAGGIE Son of a bitch, Haller.
MICK Rules are rules.
MAGGIE I wanted this one...
Alright I'll go quietly.
But after today's hearing, if you don't object.
MICK Depends.
MICK You going for no-bail?
MAGGIE That won't change with the prosecutor.
MAGGIE Not with what your guy did.
MAGGIE With which she shows him the photo: gruesome.
MICK If he did it.
MAGGIE Sure.
MAGGIE "If."
MAGGIE They only picked him up in her home with blood all over him, but it's a valid question...
MICK I love it when you're sarcastic.
MICK Can I at least see the arrest report?
MAGGIE Get it from whoever takes over.
MAGGIE No favors on this one.
Mick looks admiringly at Maggie.
At her passion.
MICK How's Hayley?
MICK A beat.
MICK Off the sudden shift in topic, Maggie starts putting away the things on her desk...
MAGGIE She's good.
MAGGIE She likes the things you send her but would rather you show up yourself...
MICK How about this weekend?
MICK This takes her by surprise.
MICK But she takes him up on it.
MAGGIE Okay, I'll tell Hayley.
MAGGIE Tonight.
MAGGIE Only Mick-- don't cancel on her.
A TV CAMERA is trained toward LOUIS in the HOLDING AREA, he tries avoiding it...
while MICK AND MAGGIE are ARGUING IN
MICK Judge, there is no way the state can claim my client is a flight
MAGGIE With resources like this man has, it's always a risk-- let alone the fact that the victim was brutally
Ms. McPherson, the extent of her injuries are not the point.
I'm setting bail at a million dollars...
Mick wins, Maggie loses.
Exchange glances--
Mick bangs out, always moving.
Getting the door for him is his friend, bail bondsman "VAL" VALENZUELA, excited--
VAL What'd I tell you, Mick, we got us a franchise...
MICK We'll see, Val...
VAL There's the lawyer-guy, you get him to go for the cash-bond...
VAL MOVING from Val, Mick HEADS DOWN THE HALL, through the BUSY CRUSH of attorneys, clients, spectators to-- DOBBS, waiting.
MICK Cecil Dobbs?
DOBBS Mr. Haller.
DOBBS It was depressing to see the boy caught up in that cattle call...
MICK Boy?
DOBBS I've represented the family so long I think of Louis that way.
MICK He did look a little frail.
MICK My advice is, let Mr. Valenzuela fix you up with a bond and take "the boy" home.
DOBBS A bond?
DOBBS But Mrs. Windsor was thinking of putting up property...
MICK No good.
MICK Assessing it will take days.
MICK By then Louis might be carrying somebody's child.
MICK So just tap Val for the bond, spring Louis, and take him to your office.
MICK We'll meet there at Four.
MICK And heads off again.
MICK Dobbs follows him out, to...
Sunlight.
Where Dobbs suddenly TENSES as he SEES: A TV CAMERAMAN coming out with camera.
Off Dobbs's reaction--
MICK Yep.
MICK Media's already picked us up.
DOBBS Mrs. Windsor's sensitive about the press...
DOBBS Mick, a beat.
DOBBS Then calls the cameraman over.
DOBBS When he comes--
MICK I saw you in there filming.
MICK What's your name?
Rob Gillen.
They call me "Sticks."
MICK You freelancing on this, Sticks?
STICKS Your client's got profile, I figure I can sell it to local news.
MICK How much?
STICKS 'Scuse me?
MICK How much will they pay you for what you shot today?
STICKS That depends.
STICKS Seven, seven-fifty.
MICK Suppose we take it off your hands for eight.
MICK Sticks hesitates, like it's not the legit thing to do.
MICK (CONT'D) Or do we make it a thousand.
Sticks hesitates no longer.
Takes the tape from the camera and hands it to Mick...
who's already counting out money from the roll of cash Ted gave him.
To Dobbs--
MICK (CONT'D) I can expense this, right?
Of course.
Absolutely.
Sticks takes the money, goes.
Dobbs, impressed, beaming now--
I'll admit, Mr. Haller, you weren't my choice.
You were Louis's.
Frankly I'd never heard of you.
But maybe I should have.
Seems to me I've underestimated you.
MICK Then let's talk about my fees.
MICK I'll need a hundred thousand up front.
MICK Working off five-fifty an hour, it'll come to another hundred thousand if we go to trial.
MICK That's estimating the trial at a week.
MICK Appeals, we start over.
MICK Mick's Lincoln pulls up smoothly to fetch him at the curb.
MICK Mick, hand on the door--
MICK (CONT'D) I take it that's not a problem.
MICK (CONT'D) Reaction Dobbs-- hesitates but has no choice.
MICK (CONT'D) MICK GETS IN, we GLIMPSE THE LINCOLN'S LICENSE PLATE: NT GLTY 2-- CUT TO,
LORNA'S VOICE How'd it go, Mickey?
LORNA'S VOICE We get the case?
MICK We've got it if we want it.
MICK I'd still like to know the state's case, what they've got on him...
LORNA'S VOICE What's the difference?
LORNA'S VOICE 'Course we want the case...
LORNA'S VOICE Mick says nothing.
LORNA'S VOICE Gaze out the window.
LORNA'S VOICE Then...
MICK I've got an hour til he's released.
MICK Til then I'll be at county.
MICK With Gloria.
MICK Any calls?
LORNA'S VOICE Only Sticks.
LORNA'S VOICE He says he owes you five hundred next time he sees you.
MICK Yeah he does.
GLORIA Mickey Mantle.
GLORIA You're going to bat for me again?
GLORIA GLORIA, redhead, 27 but good looks already fading-- greets the arriving Mick in a client/attorney booth.
MICK You don't even know who the Mick was.
MICK You don't look good, Gloria.
GLORIA Thanks.
GLORIA For coming, not for the compliment.
GLORIA Mick's already paging through her arrest-sheet, sees...
MICK Something new for you, getting booked on possession of coke, along with the usual.
GLORIA Dumb, I know.
GLORIA A guy paid me with it, I had it on me when I went to my next.
MICK And your next was a cop.
She shrugs/nods.
Mick keeps turning pages, looking for a break...
while...
GLORIA Can't you get me into one of those rehab places where they get you straight?
MICK We did a pre-trial rehab, last time.
MICK The D.A. won't go for it again.
MICK You may have to do some jail here.
GLORIA I can't.
MICK Yeah you can.
MICK They've got programs in jail, too.
MICK Look, you've had a long run.
MICK Maybe after this you can finally get out of the life.
GLORIA And do what?
GLORIA Have kids and plant flowers?
GLORIA Look at me.
GLORIA Mick doesn't have an answer.
GLORIA Opens a notebook, gets to work.
MICK Okay, tell me what happened.
GLORIA I did a guy at the Travel Lodge on Santa Monica...
MICK The one who paid you coke instead of money?
GLORIA He had a shitload in there.
GLORIA I saw.
GLORIA Which gets Mick's attention.
GLORIA His wheels suddenly turning...
MICK Do you know who he was?
GLORIA No.
GLORIA He reached me on my website.
GLORIA He was Mexican or something.
MICK Did you screen him?
GLORIA Don't I screen 'em all?
MICK off what, his driver's license?
GLORIA No, his passport.
GLORIA I think his name was, Hector, or--
MICK Hector what?
MICK Last name.
MICK Think.
MICK Moya.
MICK Hector "Arrande" Moya is what you get if you run a trace.
MICK He's Colombian, a fugitive from a Grand Jury indictment down in Florida.
MICK The DEA wants him for drug trafficking.
MICK The D.A.'s LESLIE FAIRE: a woman, well-dressed, humorless.
MICK (CONT'D) Leslie?
MICK (CONT'D) They want him a lot.
LESLIE FAIRE And your girl's looking to trade?
MICK She'll give you his motel and room number.
LESLIE FAIRE She'll also have to testify on the coke.
MICK That's a No.
MICK Location only.
MICK Your guys take it from there.
MICK My investigator says Hector hasn't checked out yet.
LESLIE FAIRE What's she want in exchange?
MICK You drop charges, and all she does is a Pre-trial Rehabilitation.
MICK The facility at USC-Med would be nice.
MICK Or do I take this straight to the Feds?
MICK Which, though veiled, is a threat.
MICK Leslie hates this.
HIGH FLOOR, TALL WINDOWS.
DOBBS, ON THE CUT, lets in MICK.
Mick's checking the impressive room, vast views all the way to the Pacific, as the OTHERS enter behind him: MARY WINDSOR
Another man, 45, thickly built, enters at Mick's side.
MICK Mrs. Windsor, this is Raul Levin.
MICK Mr. Levin's my investigator.
MICK Accepting this, everyone takes their place at the long, blonde-wood conference table.
MICK Mick can't help run his hand over the surface, everything's a contrast to his own on-the- fly office...
MICK Dobbs, to Mrs. Windsor...
DOBBS Mrs. Windsor, I can't commend Mr.
DOBBS Haller highly enough for his performance in court this morning.
DOBBS Mary Windsor nods, provisionally pleased.
MARY WINDSOR I have a check for you, Mr. Haller.
MARY WINDSOR And slides it towards him in an envelope.
MARY WINDSOR Mick, tries not to seem too much in a hurry as he glances inside--
ANGLE, we glimpse the amount, the zeroes...
$100,000...
BUT:
MICK I'm going to need that to come from your son, Mrs. Windsor.
MICK You can give him the money so he can write the check.
MICK But I want the check to come from Louis.
MICK He's my client and that's got to be clear from the start.
MICK No offense.
She is offended-- but takes back the envelope, nods to LOUIS.
He takes out a checkbook, writes.
Mick continues to Mary--
MICK (CONT'D) Thank you.
MICK (CONT'D) I'll expect you to support your son through this in other ways.
MICK (CONT'D) If you're willing.
MARY WINDSOR Don't be silly.
MARY WINDSOR I'll back my son come hell or high water.
MARY WINDSOR These ridiculous charges.
MARY WINDSOR That ridiculous woman.
MICK It's good to know you'll be there when we need you.
MARY WINDSOR But not now, is that it?
MICK We'll be going over the case.
MICK The D.A.
MICK could make you testify about what you hear.
MICK Attorney privilege doesn't cover you.
MICK Mary Windsor's motionless a moment.
MICK Rather than respond, she simply rises.
MICK To Louis--
MARY WINDSOR I will see you at dinner.
And goes.
Dobbs gets the door for her.
When she's gone:
LOUIS My mother built a good business.
LOUIS From the ground up.
MICK I've got no trouble believing that.
MICK I say we get started.
MICK All agree, they sit, Mick starts up--
MICK (CONT'D) Our first choice is whether we waive our right to a speedy trial.
LOUIS No.
LOUIS I want this behind me.
MICK You sure?
MICK You can stretch things out, enjoy your freedom.
MICK Most clients...
LOUIS Guilty clients, you mean.
LOUIS I want this over.
LOUIS Mick's struck by how firm.
MICK Fine.
MICK We go to trial right away.
MICK Puts more pressure on the D.A.
DOBBS Or maybe the case never even goes to trial.
DOBBS Our firm's clout is considerable.
DOBBS Pressure can be brought to bear--
Don't kid yourself, Cecil.
No way the state is dropping these charges.
In fact, they've already upped them-- to improve their negotiating position.
LOUIS There won't be any negotiating.
LOUIS No plea bargain, no nothing.
LOUIS I'm not going to jail for something I didn't do.
MICK It might not be jail.
LOUIS Even if I walk.
LOUIS I'm innocent and if there's a trial I want to get on the stand and tell the jury I'm innocent.
LOUIS If that's a problem we can part company right now.
LOUIS Mick looks at the young man.
LOUIS Evaluating.
LOUIS Then...
MICK Time to tell me what happened.
Louis.
Removes his Ray-Bans.
SUDDENLY:
CAMERA MOVES among L.A. yuppies, night-players.
The scene's low-key but sexy, expensive...
Waitresses roam...
LOUIS (V.O.) I was having a drink at Morgan's, Ventura Boulevard...
MICK (V.0.) Morgan's, that's a singles bar, right?
MICK (V.0.) Camera finds LOUIS at the bar, checking out the action...
LOUIS (V.O. ) Right, nice place, good for pick- ups.
LOUIS (V.O. ) That's why I was there.
LOUIS (V.O. ) Looking to get laid, pure and simple.
Mick, to Raul, who's holding a dark blue file:
MICK Raul, what's the file say about the girl?
RAUL Regina Campo, goes by "Reggie."
RAUL Twenty six.
RAUL An actress and a telephone solicitor.
DOBBS And hoping to retire.
DOBBS Soon as she sues my client.
MICK Did you know her before last night?
REGGIE CAMPO, mid-20s, the finest sexual kitten imaginable, humor enlivening her face and eyes and mouth, moving...
LOUIS (V.O.) I'd seen her around, but never spoke to her.
LOUIS (V.O.) She was always with a guy.
LOUIS (V.O.) She was with one last night.
LOUIS (V.O.) She slows as she passes Louis, whispers, her lips brush his face as she discreetly hands him something...
LOUIS (V.O.) LOUIS (V.
LOUIS (V.O.) O.)
LOUIS (V.O.) (con t' d) She just laid her address on me.
LOUIS (V.O.) On a napkin.
MICK (V.0.) But she was still with a guy?
MICK (V.0.) Reggie returns to: THE GUY at the bar: 40s, hard like a vet.
LOUIS (V.0.) I got it that she wasn't too into her date.
LOUIS (V.0.) She told me he'd be gone by ten if I was interested.
LOUIS (CONT'D) I didn't keep the napkin.
LOUIS (CONT'D) I work in real estate, I remember addresses.
MICK Raul.
MICK Check that file you've got and see if the Police report has any of this.
MICK While Raul looks, Mick explains to Louis and Dobbs, can't hide some professional pride in Raul Levin's work--
MICK (CONT'D) Raul's already worked us a little miracle.
MICK (CONT'D) He's managed to score a copy of the discovery file, everything the D.A.'s got.
MICK (CONT'D) They'd have to turn it over eventually but it could have been weeks.
MICK (CONT'D) Under which, Raul's checked the blue file, and...
RAUL Nope.
RAUL They don't have the other guy.
RAUL They don't even have the bar.
MICK All they've got is, Louis shows up and beats the crap out of her?
RAUL That's it.
LOUIS That is such bullshit--
MICK Just keep telling me.
LOUIS is sitting in a Porsche Carrera...
LOUIS (V.0.) I didn't want to walk in on anything, so I got there early.
LOUIS (V.0.) His POV, shadow-figure of Hard-Guy approaching in the dark..
LOUIS (CONT'D) I waited til the guy came out.
MICK (V.0.) You see what he was driving?
LOUIS (V.0.) A Corvette.
LOUIS (V.0.) Yellow.
LOUIS (V.0.) Hard-Guy gets in the Corvette, pulls out.
MICK (V.0.) So he leaves, and you go in...
Arriving up the stairs is Louis, knocks.
A little while, and the door opens a crack.
Reggie, part of her face, peers out.
LOUIS (V.O.) She saw it was me...
LOUIS (V.
O.)
(coast' d) The hallway inside was tight.
I had to walk past her, y'know, so she could close the door.
So I had to turn my back to her.
We SEE this, she's behind him...
as we hear, simply...
LOUIS (V.0.)
(cont'd) Then, that was it.
MICK What was what?
LOUIS She hit me with something and I went down.
LOUIS It got black fast.
LOUIS SUDDEN POP TO, LOUIS STRUCK FROM BEHIND...
LOUIS Blacking out as he tumbles...
LOUIS BACK TO,
Conference table's silent.
All looking at Louis.
MICK Okay then.
MICK What do you remember next?
LOUIS Waking up with two guys sitting on me.
LOUIS Holding me down.
TWO GUYS straddle Louis who is face down on the floor.
LOUIS (V.0.)
(cont'd) Couple of faggots from next door.
RAUL Police report has them, homosexual couple from down the hall...
LOUIS Like I said.
LOUIS Faggots.
LOUIS To which Raul says nothing.
LOUIS After a beat--
MICK Go on, Louis.
LOUIS I was still foggy when the cops came...
BACK TO, LIVING ROOM...
Louis is cuffed by now, hands behind him, COP looms over...
LOUIS (V.O.)
(cont'd) She was on the couch telling all these lies...
PARAMEDICS work on Reggie's bloodied face while, to a FEMALE COP (MAXWELL), through sobs, still frightened--
REGGIE .he was like an animal!
REGGIE He said he'd rape me and kill me...
REGGIE then rape me again when I was dead...
REGGIE Louis looks around at his left hand in a plastic ba Bloody.
LOUIS (V.O. ) That's when I saw she'd set it up.
MICK Set it up how?
LOUIS Put blood on my hand.
LOUIS My left hand.
LOUIS But I'm right-handed, I'd use my right if I was going to...
LOUIS punch someone.
LOUIS Which is crazy.
LOUIS Louis mimes throwing a punch, in the air.
LOUIS Inept.
DOBBS Louis never hit anyone in his life.
RAUL What she did made sense.
RAUL It's the right side of her face that was hit, she had to bloody your left.
MICK Louis: You said she opened the door a crack.
MICK Did you see her face?
LOUIS Not all of it...
It open a crack.
Enough for her look out, half her face...
LOUIS (V.0.)
(cont'd) Mainly her eye.
Her left eye.
RAUL (V.0.) That's it!...
RAUL (V.0.) BACK TO, LAW OFFICE.
RAUL (V.0.) Raul...
RAUL (V.0.) mimes the opening of the door...
RAUL (CONT'D) She already had the injuries, on the right.
RAUL (CONT'D) She was hiding it from him when he steps in...
MICK And then she clocks him?
LOUIS Yes.
MICK So our case is, she beat herself up?
MICK Mick takes the file, takes the 8xl0s, REGGIE'S PULPED FACE...
MICK (CONT'D) We're saying, she pounded her face into hamburger meat, or had her boyfriend do it, hoping some far- off day a jury would give her a big fat reward?
LOUIS She must have.
DOBBS Of course.
DOBBS She saw his Porsche, his Rolex, it's known the family has money...
DOBBS I'll wager she's already filed in civil court.
DOBBS Mick.
DOBBS Thinks.
DOBBS Then, to Raul--
MICK Okay, the police report.
MICK Let's hear how Reggie tells it.
She's opened a crack, peering out...
Raul reads...
"According to the victim, she was at home alone when the suspect presented himself at the door as someone she knew..."
Louis is there, talks MOS.
Reggie opens the rest of the way.
RAUL (V.0.)
(cont'd) "Upon letting him in, she was immediately struck..."
WHICH WE SEE: The vicious repeated pounding of her face, bloodying her, but it's too fast & jumbled for details...
MICK (V.0.) Does it say he knocked her down?
MICK (V.0.) She falls...
MICK (V.0.) Louis flies down on top of her...
RAUL (V.0.) Yeah, then straddled her.
RAUL (V.0.) "Held the victim by the neck until she agreed to cooperate..."
RAUL (V.0.) Louis does as described, strangle-hold...
RAUL (V.0.) Eventually lets her up, turning her toward the bedroom.
RAUL (V.0.) And...
RAUL (V.0.) RAUL (V.O.)
RAUL (V.0.) (cont'd) "The suspect maintained a position behind her, holding a knife against the left side of her throat..."
Raul takes something new from the file: PHOTO OF A BLOODY KNIFE.
Sharpened to a point.
Louis looks at it.
Seethes.
LOUIS This isn't my knife.
MICK Raul, are his prints on there?
RAUL That's what the report says.
RAUL I'm not surprised, if she put blood on his hands she's gonna put prints on his knife...
LOUIS I told you, it's not "my" knife!
LOUIS Mick ignores, still intent on Raul's reading...
MICK Okay, how's she say he went down?
RAUL "As Ms. Campo entered the hallway, she pushed the intruder backwards into a large floor vase..."
And Reggie scurrying free...
STAY ON the fallen Louis as...
RAUL (V.0.) "Realizing her attacker would catch her at the front door, she ducked into the kitchen and seized a bottle of vodka..."
RAUL (V.0.) Louis, struggling to his feet, HIT ON THE HEAD from behind..
And clonked him when he got up?
RAUL (V.0.) That's how she tells it.
LOUIS Those are all lies, this is bull--
MICK If everything she said is a lie, this will be the easiest case ever.
MICK I'll tear her apart and throw her entrails into the sea.
MICK But Louis...
MICK You swear it's all lies?
MICK Is there anything you aren't telling me?
MICK Mick's eyes burn into him.
MICK Louis answers simply.
LOUIS Nothing.
LOUIS Mick holds him in a long, hard, assessing stare.
LOUIS Over which, eventually, we PRE-LAP--
MICK (V.O.) The way Louis tells it...
MICK .it's just quirky enough.
MICK Mick and Raul coming out, after having a few.
MICK It's a lawyers' hangout at this hour, others are coming/going...
RAUL Quirky enough for what?
MICK To be true.
MICK Maybe it went down just like he says.
MICK Anyway there's a.
MICK chance.
MICK In a party of law-types, we GLIMPSE MAGGIE, who catches sight of Mick in the doorway...
MICK while Raul mulls what Mick said...
RAUL An innocent client.
RAUL Jeezus.
MICK Yeah.
MICK But you know what my father said about innocent clients...
MICK Maggie's overheard this, gives the answer.
MAGGIE He said there's no client as scary as an innocent man.
MAGGIE Mick, seeing her, smiles and continues, a little tipsy...
MICK That's right.
MICK Because if you screw up and he goes to prison, it scars you for life.
MICK There's only one verdict.
MICK You've got to put an N.G.
MICK on the board.
Hey Mags.
She reads the state he's in.
MAGGIE Raul, if you let a man drive in his condition I think I can charge you both.
MAGGIE The guys look at each other.
MAGGIE Maggie swipes the keys--
MAGGIE (CONT'D) I'll drive him to his house.
RAUL And how will you get home?
MAGGIE My friends brought me.
MAGGIE I'll keep the car, he can pick it up at my place in the morning.
Get in.
And she gets in the driver's side, waits.
Mick to Raul--
MICK Okay, you know the moves.
MICK Make the rounds, check out Morgan's Bar...
RAUL And Mr. Corvette...
MICK And Regina Campo.
MICK The way Louis says she came on's got me wondering.
MICK Mick gets in and closes the door.
MICK As Maggie starts it up and pulls away, and we SEE the "NT GLTY" PLATES again...
MICK go to...
Ride in silence.
Then Mick, mischievous, turns on the RAP.
TUPAC "God bless the dead and buried nigga, Don't worry if you see God first, Tell him shit got worse..."
MAGGIE You've got to be kidding me.
MICK Earl lays this stuff on me.
MAGGIE Where is Earl tonight?
MICK I never keep him this late.
MAGGIE Hasn't he worked your fee off yet?
MICK A while ago.
MICK But he likes driving, keeps him out of trouble...
MICK He's taking courses, too, in music.
MAGGIE You can't tell by this stuff.
MAGGIE She snaps the rap OFF.
MICK You get used to it.
MICK Besides, Tupac, he helps me understand my clients.
MICK Most of them go to school on his
MAGGIE Not Roulet.
MICK Not Louis, no.
MICK Louis is my franchise player, he pays for all the rest...
MICK After a beat...
MICK Office gossip...
MAGGIE I heard Smithson assigned Ted Minton to your case.
MICK Never heard of him.
MAGGIE He's brand new.
MAGGIE Bright, though.
MAGGIE Smithson's protegee.
MAGGIE Naturally.
MAGGIE Georgetown, buys his suits at Brooks, above all he's a guy...
MAGGIE Mick looks over at her, as she flares, calms...
MAGGIE Moonlight lines her profile.
MAGGIE Made self-conscious by his watching her, she moves her hair from her face.
MAGGIE Beyond pretty: Beautiful.
MICK Lorna made me my schedule.
MICK Saturday's fine to take Hayley.
MAGGIE Saturday there's the Sponge-Bob movie...
MICK I'm all over it.
MICK How's she doing?
MAGGIE I'll know when I drop you and get home to relieve the sitter...
MAGGIE What?
MICK Moonlight becomes you.
That's not doing me any good, Haller.
The Lincoln pulls up.
Mick gets out but stands there.
MICK Thanks.
MICK She nods You're welcome.
MICK And pulls away.
MICK Mick's smile fades as he looks up at his dark lonely house.
AN ANSWERING MACHINE, he's just hit Play.
BEEP.
Daddy, Mommy said I could call and say G'night.
Sorry you're not there.
G'night, Daddy.
MICK Me too, baby.
MICK Then Mick hits "Play" again.
MICK BEEP.
Daddy, Mommy said I could call...
Off a FRAMED PHOTO: HAYLEY, B, curls, Irish eyes...
Mick's got a drink in his hand.
Below: L.A. is spread out: Wide, white scattering of lights.
Above: Stars.
Top o' the mornin', Mr. McGinley!
You know what day it is?
Mick's client, DARIUS McGINLEY, black, 2B: In chains.
Mick is beside him, as he answers, confused--
DARIUS The day I get my sentence?
JUDGE FLYNN That too.
JUDGE FLYNN But it's also St.
JUDGE FLYNN Patrick's Day.
JUDGE FLYNN A day to revel in your Irish heritage.
JUDGE FLYNN Darius doesn't get Flynn's joke.
JUDGE FLYNN Mick cautions Darius, low--
He's an asshole but just be cool.
Darius scowls...
under which Mick notices that RAUL has showed up, is trying to get his attention...
while...
JUDGE FLYNN Do you know the origin of your name, Mr. McGinley?
DARIUS Slave-holder, I 'spect.
DARIUS Why do I care who that motherfucka be?
MICK Darius I told you--
DARIUS The man's dissin' me!
Alright: If you don't care about your name, then I don't.
JUDGE FLYNN (cont'd) Let's get on with your sentence for the sale of rock cocaine and get you off to prison, shall we?
Darius, pissed.
Raul waves to Mick, wants to talk...
Darius led off by guards-- Mick, defeated, confronts Raul.
MICK What couldn't wait, Raul?
RAUL Wanna see a movie?
FIXED DOWNWARD ANGLE on the bar, near the cash register.
Tending bar, two hot young women, jeans, white t-shirts...
FRAME-COUNTER ticks off, bottom right: 8:11 P.M., MARCH 6.
RAUL'S VOICE We caught a break.
RAUL'S VOICE The owner had a camera installed to watch his register after he caught the help dipping in last year...
MICK'S VOICE And here comes Louis.
Said as LOUIS enters frame, sits.
MOS, orders a drink.
We're:
While Earl stands outside the car, as if on guard.
.Raul points out the action, working the keys...
RAUL I had the tape transferred to disc, so I could manipulate, y'know...
RAUL Raul starts to ZOOM...
RAUL Shows Mick, on the SCREEN...
RAUL (CONT'D) I'd like you to meet Reggie Campo.
ZOOMING IN on REGGIE AND HER GUY, over drinks...
FREEZES.
RAUL'S VOICE And Mr. X. The Corvette-man.
MICK'S VOICE Are you sure?
RAUL'S VOICE Wouldn't have popped a grand for the tape if I wasn't.
RAUL'S VOICE Now watch...
RAUL'S VOICE STARTS PLAYING IMAGE AGAIN, widen to full shot.
RAUL'S VOICE RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd) Nothing for like a half-hour...
RAUL'S VOICE He RACES THE TAPE FORWARD...
RAUL'S VOICE Time code FLIES...
RAUL'S VOICE He slows it as it reaches 8:40, 41, 42...43.
RAUL'S VOICE RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd) Then...
RAUL'S VOICE Here.
RAUL'S VOICE Mr. X gets up, with pack of cigarettes, goes...
MICK'S VOICE I know the place.
MICK'S VOICE They got a smoking porch out front.
RAUL'S VOICE That's where he goese.
RAUL'S VOICE Giving Reggie her chance.
RAUL'S VOICE Watch her.
RAUL'S VOICE She passes behind Louis, trails her hand along his shoulders...
RAUL'S VOICE keeps going out of frame...
That's not how he said it went down.
He said she gave him her address, on a napkin...
RAUL'S VOICE Whoa, wait, she just went to the little girls'.
RAUL'S VOICE But she's gotta come back, no?
RAUL'S VOICE And NOW HE FAST-FORWARDS TAPE AGAIN...
RAUL'S VOICE And this time she stops by Louis, speaks into his ear, presses her body against him...
RAUL'S VOICE Louis nods, takes something from her...
RAUL'S VOICE Reggie kisses his cheek quickly, continues on...
RAUL'S VOICE Rejoins X at the bar.
MICK Do the cops have this?
RAUL How can they?
RAUL I got the one and only.
RAUL It ain't a copy.
MICK You're exceedingly beautiful.
RAUL Wait.
RAUL .Reggie and X decide to split...
Guy takes a final swig, finishing drink...
they exit frame.
RAUL'S VOICE Check out his hand, his watch.
MICK'S VOICE It's on his left.
MICK'S VOICE That's no good...
MICK It means he's right-handed.
MICK But the facial blows were from the left...
RAUL Slow down.
RAUL You said you knew Morgan's.
RAUL So you oughta realize...
RAUL This image is in the mirror over the bar.
RAUL That's how the owner set the camera to watch his register.
MICK So everything's backwards...
RAUL And X punches with his left.
MICK I told you you were beautiful.
MICK Anything else?
RAUL Yeah.
RAUL But it's not on the tape.
RAUL You know how you were wondering about Regina?
MICK Yeah?
MICK Raul just looks at him.
MICK Off Mick,
Jams/wedges its way through traffic, to halt at the curb.
MICK exits, heads towards...
into...
Behind the reception desk is ROBIN, tan/sexy blonde, hair hanging straight over one eye like a scythe...
MICK Mickey Haller.
MICK Here to see Louis.
Mr. Roulet is with someone.
He can't be disturbed.
It's like he doesn't hear her-- walks calmly past her-- to -- THE DOOR TO LOUIS ROULET'S OFFICE- Mick ENTERS, finds Louis with his loafers off, on the couch with his cell-phone cradled to his ear.
Robin chases behind...
I'm sorry, Mr. Roulet, this man just came back here--
LOUIS It's okay, Robin.
LOUIS You can go.
LOUIS Robin exits.
LOUIS Louis mutters an apology into his cell-phone and rings off.
LOUIS Looks annoyed at Mick.
LOUIS (CONT'D) I was setting up a showing.
MICK There won't be any showings in Pelican Bay.
LOUIS Where's that?
MICK It's a supermax prison where they send violent sex offenders.
MICK You'll fit in real good in your loafers.
LOUIS What's the matter?
MICK You lied to me, Louis.
MICK I'm about to go and see the new prosecutor, who's doing everything he can to put you away, and now I find out you've been lying.
MICK Tell me about Reggie Campo.
LOUIS What about her?
LOUIS I've told you--
MICK You didn't tell me.
MICK That you were going to pay her for sex.
MICK You think it's hard to find out somebody's not Snow White?
LOUIS Alright yes, I was going to pay.
LOUIS She wrote down a price on the napkin, four hundred dollars...
MICK Why didn't you tell me this in Cecil's office?
LOUIS I didn't want my mother to know.
LOUIS Cecil tells her everything.
LOUIS And can we keep it down?
LOUIS Her office is on the other side of that door...
LOUIS Mick looks at Louis's concern.
LOUIS Believes it.
LOUIS Easing up...
MICK This changes things.
MICK You see that, don't you?
LOUIS I'm not a lawyer.
LOUIS Explain it to me.
MICK Alright I will.
MICK You know that guy on the Venice boardwalk?
MICK The one who has all those plates spinning on sticks?
LOUIS What does this have to do with--
MICK Just listen.
MICK A bunch of spinning plates: that's the state's case.
MICK In the middle is a big one.
MICK It's a fucking platter.
MICK And if that falls it takes the others down with it.
MICK The big plate is the victim.
MICK The only witness against you.
MICK I knock her down, the act is over and the crowd goes home.
MICK No trial.
MICK Mick has Louis' attention now.
LOUIS You can make this trial go away?
MICK We've lost time.
MICK You concealed from me the fact that could do it.
MICK It comes down to why.
LOUIS Why what?
MICK Why would a guy with a Porsche and a Rolex need a knife to get sex from a woman who sells it anyway?
MICK The answer is, he wouldn't.
MICK And when you see that you see the set- up, the trap.
MICK And suddenly it's the defendant who looks like the victim.
MICK Louis gets it.
MICK Penitent.
LOUIS You're going to the prosecutor now?
MICK Yes.
MICK Young hot-shot named Ted Minton.
MICK He wants to give me the discovery file.
MICK Poor guy doesn't know that Raul already got it.
MICK He's new to felonies but he's no dope.
MICK When he hears his vic's a hooker he'll know we've knocked all his plates down.
LOUIS Then it'll be over?
MICK No promises, Louis.
MICK Louis closes his eyes, savors the prospect.
MICK Then sees Mick to the door.
MICK When he opens it: MARY WINDSOR's there.
MICK Surprised to see Haller.
I didn't know you were here.
Is there news?
LOUIS There will be, Mother.
LOUIS And puts out a hand to Mick.
LOUIS Grateful.
LOUIS Hesitating half a beat, Mick shakes it and goes...
LOUIS Louis and his Mother.
LOUIS Regard each other.
LOUIS Face to face.
Mick in a chair.
Impatient.
Legal secretaries, prosecutors, etc., come and go, when-- a guy Mick recognizes, DETECTIVE KURLEN, fat, 40, approaches a desk with a stack of papers--
SECRETARY Are these for A.D.A. Knight?
KURLEN Yeah, and they're my only copies.
KURLEN I'll wait while you copy them.
SECRETARY I'll have to ask her...
SECRETARY But, he holds them back.
SECRETARY Stares.
SECRETARY She yields...
I'll run them for you now.
KURLEN Just what I wanted to hear.
KURLEN She goes.
KURLEN Mick tries to avoid Kurlen-- but too late--
KURLEN (CONT'D) Well, look who's come callin'.
MICK Detective Kurlen.
KURLEN Puttin' a case away.
KURLEN Guy drowned his neighbor's kid in a tub to see what it felt like.
KURLEN It won't shock you to hear he was high...
MICK Thanks for clearing that up.
KURLEN If he gets San Quentin, maybe he can look up your boy Jesus Martinez.
KURLEN Mick bristles at this reference.
KURLEN Turns away again.
KURLEN To a
MICK Is Minton back yet?--
He'll be a few more minutes, sir.
Kurlen, seeing he's drawn blood, continues to needle.
KURLEN How's he doin' up there, anyway?
KURLEN He make the pucker-up-and-kiss-me team?
MICK I haven't talked to him.
KURLEN I guess once they plead guilty, they're not much use to you.
KURLEN (CONT'D) He went down forever, right?
MICK He got life, but he'll be out.
MICK I don't know when.
KURLEN Too bad.
KURLEN 'Cause his victim, Martha Renteria?
KURLEN She's dead forever.
MICK You don't have to remind me you were lead dick on that.
MICK Kurlen grins.
MICK Shakes his head.
KURLEN How's a guy like you sleep at night?
KURLEN With the scum you represent.
KURLEN Mick's had enough.
KURLEN Moves closer.
KURLEN To tell him a story.
MICK I had a client once, he decapitated his ex-wife, then kept her head in the refrigerator.
Naturally you got him off.
MICK The D.A. got greedy.
MICK Tried to pile on two unsolved murders, trick up evidence to stick my guy with them.
MICK It's called the justice system, we don't do things that way.
So your guy's out walkin' around.
He ever do it again?
MICK I don't know.
MICK I never heard of him after that.
KURLEN But he could have.
KURLEN Fuck you, Haller.
No.
Fuck the D.A.
Before Kurlen can react-- TED MINTON arrives.
Fresh-faced, Ivy League, 30.
TED Mr. Haller?
TED Sorry you had to wait.
TED I hope it'll be worth your while.
TED He gives Mick a thin, white-covered file from a briefcase.
TED Mick, leaving the still-sneering Kurlen behind, takes the file and follows Minton off-- tapping the file with a finger--
MICK Looks kinda thin for a discovery
TED Yes well-- We can go to my office--
MICK I've got a question first.
MICK He takes from his pocket: Raul's DISC.
MICK The DVD Raul gave him.
MICK (CONT'D) You have something to play this on?
ANGLE the young prosecutor's face as he watches the bar-tape.
And Mick watching him for his reaction...
When it's done, Ted clicks it OFF.
Not much reaction at all.
TED What else do you have?
TED The simple, polite question throws Mick.
MICK Look Ted, let's cut the bullshit.
MICK Not only is your so-called victim a working prostitute, but we've got her on tape soliciting my client!
MICK Maybe you're new, but you gotta know how hard it's gonna be to convince a jury a guy would have to rape a hooker to have sex with her--
TED Nothing you're telling me's going to change my offer.
MICK Offer?
MICK You're making an offer?
MICK going forward?
MICK Not the way Mick thought it would go.
MICK Ted goes on...
TED We'll drop the charges to Assault with a Deadly and Attempted Sexual Battery.
TED The guidelines put him at seven years, maybe he'll do four.
TED Mick, uncertain now, doubts himself for the first time...
MICK .What am I missing here?...
MICK Ted stays innocent-looking.
MICK Blank.
MICK with his daughter, HAYLEY, 8.
Mick's ON A BENCH near where Hayley waits on line for the next pony...
EARL approaches from the refreshment stand with an ice-cream for Hayley and one for himself.
Kids playing everywhere, a MINIATURE TRAIN chugs past...
but Mick's lost in thought, his beat-up briefcase open, he's working.
EARL Got you the good stuff, Hayley...
HAYLEY Thank you, Earl.
HAYLEY Just then a little girl gets off a pony.
HAYLEY The attendant holds it for Hayley.
EARL Man's got your ride ready...
MICK Go on, I'll hold your ice cream.
MICK Excited, Hayley goes.
MICK The attendant lifts her up and on, and The pony carrying Hayley joins the others in the wide ring...
MICK Mick watches her for a moment, waves-- then, balancing the ice cream, returns to his files--
MICK (CONT'D) There's something right in front of me and I'm not seeing it.
MICK (CONT'D) On his lap he's spread out: PAGES from the TWO FILES: the blue-covered one Raul gave him.
MICK (CONT'D) The white-covered from Ted.
MICK (CONT'D) Mick starts turning pages, compares...
MICK (CONT'D) The same, the same...
When he turns the next one over: It's the page Raul gave him showing the PICTURE OF A KNIFE, the picture we saw in Cecil Dobbs' office.
Turns to the matching page from Ted's file.
Reaction Mick...
In the parking lot, pulls up.
Louis is in front of the club, golf-clothes, waiting.
Comes out to meet the Lincoln...
HAYLEY You said we',re going to the movies!
HAYLEY You promised me last week!
MICK Daddy's got to talk to somebody.
MICK You stay with Earl.
MICK Mick gets out, Hayley stays...
Louis hurries over, as far from the clubhouse as possible, in order not to be seen or heard-- eager--
LOUIS What's happened?
LOUIS Is it over?
LOUIS You said it would be over by now--
MICK That was before I found out you were still lying to me.
MICK He shoves a sheet at Louis.
MICK Louis looks: PICTURE OF A KNIFE, but DIFFERENT from the knife-picture we saw before.
MICK (CONT'D) You know what that is?
MICK (CONT'D) It's a picture of your knife.
MICK (CONT'D) The one you had on you when you went to Reggie Campos.
MICK (CONT'D) The one the cops have.
MICK (CONT'D) Look at the blood on the blade.
MICK (CONT'D) Look at the initials.
MICK (CONT'D) Louis is stuck for an answer--
MICK (CONT'D) That's why Ted Minton didn't care when I told him Reggie's a prostitute.
MICK (CONT'D) What's it matter, when he's got a knife with her blood and your initials on it?
LOUIS This wasn't the knife in the file--
MICK That's right.
MICK The file Raul got us was a loaded deck.
MICK The cops must have been on to him, because they used it to set us up.
MICK So we'd think they had nothing, when in fact they had enough to put your Hugo Boss, golf-playing ass away for twenty years!
MICK Mick looks back towards the car, parked maybe 20 yards off.
MICK He sees HAYLEY in the backseat looking out.
MICK So does Louis.
MICK Mick sees him looking her way...
MICK Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back.
MICK Out of sight.
MICK A moment...
MICK then Mick resumes.
MICK Cold and firm.
MICK (CONT'D) Explain to me why you lied about the knife.
LOUIS I didn't lie.
LOUIS I said the one in the picture wasn't mine.
LOUIS Mick frowns/grins at the answer...
LOUIS (CONT'D) I said it twice!
LOUIS (CONT'D) Nobody listened!
What are you now, a lawyer?
A clever, third-rate fucking lawyer with smart-ass technicalities?
"You said it wasn't yours"-- What you should have said was, "I had a knife but this isn't it!" What did you think, it would just go away?
You brought a murder weapon to a meeting with a prostitute, Louis!
How am I supposed to make that look like she set you up?
LOUIS 1.
LOUIS Did.
LOUIS Not.
LOUIS Do this.
LOUIS Off which, Mick stares hard at Louis.
LOUIS At his frightened look.
LOUIS Then tries-- slowly-- as if for the last time--
MICK Then kindly tell me why you went to her apartment with a custom-made knife, serrated tip, with "LR" engraved on the blade?
LOUIS I always carry it.
LOUIS For a moment, Mick takes this in.
LOUIS Echoes.
MICK You always carry it.
LOUIS Yes.
LOUIS In real estate we show homes, to people we don't know.
LOUIS This one time...
LOUIS He stops.
LOUIS Like it's difficult.
LOUIS Then goes ahead...
LOUIS (CONT'D) My mother.
LOUIS (CONT'D) She was showing a place.
LOUIS (CONT'D) It was in Bel-Air, so she thought it was okay to go alone, even though there was a man at the time who had raped some women that way.
LOUIS (CONT'D) He was there.
MICK Who was there?
LOUIS The man.
LOUIS He raped her.
LOUIS When she didn't come back, I went to the house and found her.
LOUIS Mick.
LOUIS Stirs.
LOUIS Like he's seeing a possibility...
LOUIS (CONT'D) That's when she stopped showing property.
LOUIS (CONT'D) I do the selling now.
LOUIS (CONT'D) And I started carrying a knife.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Always.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Mick turns it over.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Finally...
MICK That's quite a story, Louis.
Your mother will have to testify.
LOUIS We don't want that.
I don't give a damn what you think we want.
From now on you do what I tell you while I try this case.
Do I make myself clear?
Louis is silent.
Mick looks off.
Towards Hayley, in the car.
ON THE CUT she OPENS TO MICK CARRYING HAYLEY IN HIS ARMSi fast asleep but still clutching a carton of movie popcorn...
Maggie leads Mick-with-Hayley through, Hayley snuggles further in her father's arms.
As they continue...
MICK If she wasn't so darn heavy I'd carry her all night, I swear.
MAGGIE Defense lawyers will swear to anything...
He's at the door about to go.
Maggie delays him with,
MAGGIE You look like you're in a daze.
MICK It turned into a rough week.
MICK Being with Hayley was the only high.
MICK She can't find anything to say.
MICK As he heads out again...
MAGGIE Nobody's seen you at Four Green Fields lately.
MICK I stopped going.
MICK Too much of a scene.
MAGGIE Yeah well.
MAGGIE If you start going again.
MAGGIE Now she has his attention.
MICK If I start again, what?
MICK She's awkward.
MICK Smiles, shrugs to cover--
MAGGIE Bunch of us from the office are there.
MAGGIE Tuesdays, after work.
MAGGIE An invitation.
MAGGIE S-zrprising him.
MICK I'll keep it in mind.
MAGGIE Okay.
MICK Okay.
MICK After more awkwardness, goes.
MICK She closes the door.
MICK CUT TO,
Noisy, drinking CROWD of legal types-- We're MOVING through it-- Don't realize it at first but it's-- MICK'S POV-- he's trying to shoulder his way through towards-- A BOOTH OF WOMEN from Maggie's office-- Maggie sees him, lights up a little--
MAGGIE Haller!
MAGGIE Let him in, girls!
MAGGIE Buy you a beer?
MICK You won't make it to the bar...
MAGGIE Then let's share this.
MAGGIE They fight to a table for two, edge of the crowd.
MAGGIE When he balks at sipping from her glass--
MAGGIE (CONT'D) We've had a taste of each other before.
MAGGIE (CONT'D) He laughs a little, reads that she's had a few.
MAGGIE (CONT'D) He drinks.
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Feeling a little better tonight?
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Or did Ted Minton sandbag you?
MICK Yeah, that's exactly what--
MAGGIE With that guy Corliss, right?
MAGGIE I told them using that dirtbag was a bullshit play.
MAGGIE But you'll take the the guy's head off on the stand...
MAGGIE Mick's off-guard, doesn't know what she's talking about.
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Whoops, I shouldn't say that...
MICK So Ted talked to you about Corliss?
MAGGIE Huh?
MAGGIE It was me who sent him to Ted.
MAGGIE Corliss thought it was my case because I handled first appearance.
MAGGIE I'm telling you too much.
MICK Nah, nothing I don't know, they always use a professional snitch...
MICK I mean Corliss has done this before, right?
MAGGIE Can't we just forget work and have a friendly Guiness?
MICK How about we go somewhere to eat?
MICK So we can talk about our daughter.
Let me tell my friends I'm leaving.
She goes.
And Mick, quick, writes the name CORLISS on napkin.
MAGGIE I'll bet you didn't know Sponge-Bob movies could be so much fun.
MICK The fun's watching her.
MICK Maggie likes this.
MICK Touch glasses.
MICK After a quiet moment...
MAGGIE You didn't know Minton had Corliss til I blabbed, did you.
MICK He was hiding something, I thought it might be a jailhouse snitch...
MAGGIE You got me drunk to find out what you wanted to know.
MAGGIE Except I was already drunk.
MAGGIE Good point, right?
MAGGIE He feels something.
MAGGIE ANGLE, her hand on his knee...
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Hayley's probably asleep.
MAGGIE (CONT'D) I gotta go relieve the sitter--
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Only I don't think I can drive myself home.
MICK one good turn.
MICK I'll drive you.
MAGGIE And will you take me back to get my car in the morning?
MAGGIE A loaded proposition.
MAGGIE Covers her hand with his own.
MAGGIE CUT TO,
ANGLE HAYLEY, sleeping between her two parents.
Mick opens his eyes: Maggie's awake and staring at him.
Grim.
MAGGIE This is not fair to her.
Waking up and finding you here.
She'll get her hopes up.
MICK How'd she get in here?
MAGGIE She comes in here when she has nightmares.
MAGGIE She has nightmares.
MICK So she sleeps in here a lot?
MAGGIE Don't start.
MAGGIE You have no idea what it's like raising a child alone.
MAGGIE He can tell by her tone: All last night's tenderness gone.
He's dressing-- she enters to him in a robe--
MICK Look-- I'll leave-- then come back in an hour.
MICK We'll go together to get your car then I can take her to
MAGGIE Just like that?
MAGGIE You're gonna start taking her to school?
MICK Don't you remember what we talked about last night?
MAGGIE I thought you were just trying to get into my head on your case-- or get me into bed--
MICK I can't win with you--
MAGGIE Not when you're being a defense lawyer!
MAGGIE Do you know how crazy we were to think we could ever make it?
MAGGIE Me trying to get dirtbags off the street, you keeping them there--
MAGGIE Just go!
Unshaven.
Edward Hopper drabness.
To lose himself in work, looks down at his files: An 8x10 OF REGGIE CAMPO'S BATTERED FACE.
WAITRESS, 50s, pours coffee.
Recoils as she glimpses the picture, the gruesome wounds, Mick didn't mean her to see.
MICK Sorry.
MICK It's work.
I just hope you catch the bastard who did it to her.
And goes.
Mick tucks the picture under some papers, to hide it-- but finds that he's only hid it halfway.
Leaving half her face exposed.
The good half.
Something about this...
He picks it up again, folds it...
Leaning over the sink, Mick holds the folded photo against the mirror, the unhurt left side showing.
Creates a full image of a face.
He stares a long time.
Then, to himself:
MICK Martha Renteria.
Mick, enters.
THREE LINCOLNS LINED UP along a wall.
Mick's "fleet."
California plates: NT GLTY 1, NT GLTY 3, NT GLTY 4..
Walks past...
to some battered file cabinets.
He turns on a single-bulb lamp...
DRAWER OPENING ON FILE CABINET...
Mick's fingers fly through the tabs of old files, stops at: MARTINEZ.
Cut to, MARTINEZ FILES ON DESK, MOMENTS LATER: Mick examines them: Police reports, printouts.
Until he finds...
Autopsy report.
Name: RENTERIA, MARIA.
Takes out...
Bx10 PHOTO: WOMAN DEAD ON A BED, NAKED.
Dark bloodstains.
NEXT PHOTO - TIGHTER: Knife-wounds.
And bruises.
NEXT PHOTO - HER FACE: BEATEN: Injuries to the left side (opposite of Reggie's.)
Dark-haired, large brown eyes.
MICK.
Folds this one in half.
Takes the folded shot of Reggie, fits them together, crease to crease: So alike, they form what could be the face of one woman.
Mick.
Not wanting to face the memory: a VOICE in his head:
MICK'S VOICE I wish you'd called me before you talked to the cops, Jesus...
FLASHBACK OF MICK WITH MARTINEZ, who's stalking around, in a panic, while Mick is laying out the bad news...
I seen my picture every place!
They was gonna bring me in, so...
MICK But you told Kurlen you were in her apartment.
MICK He didn't have that, he doesn't even have any prints...
MARTINEZ That shit I tol' is true, man!
MARTINEZ I seen her at the Cobra Room, she said if I paid we could go to her place, she didn't care about the other guy...
MICK Nobody saw any "other guy"...
MARTINEZ There was another guy, bpi guy that she was talking to...
MICK Plus the coroner says her vagina was brutalized...
MARTINEZ Are you my lawyer or what, man?
MARTINEZ When I left that chick was fine!
MARTINEZ I fucked her but I didn't hurt her-- You ain't even listenin'--
MICK Three people saw you throwing a knife into the L.A. River...
MARTINEZ 'Cause I had that knife in my car!
MARTINEZ I knew they was gonna find it...
MICK If all you did was fuck her then why didn't you leave any prints?
MICK The place was wiped down...
MICK (CONT'D) But your semen was on the towel, you forgot you wiped your penis on that towel...
MARTINEZ I didn't forget nothing!
MARTINEZ I jus' used that towel, then I give the chick the money and I left!
MICK It's not gonna make.
MARTINEZ Don't say that!
MICK Jesus they want the death penalty!
MICK I can see to it that never happens, but not if you don't plead.
MARTINEZ You want me to say I did this?
MARTINEZ Mick hesitates but stays level.
MARTINEZ Unbending.
MARTINEZ No choice.
Jesus, there's a deal to be made.
I can do that.
I can get you Life.
Life means you'll do fifteen...
MARTINEZ I'm innocent!
MARTINEZ Inocente!
MARTINEZ You know what that means?
MARTINEZ Mick just looks at him.
Not much traffic rolling out of the city, mid-morning...
Mick at the wheel.
Beside him, his briefcase.
SEES OUT ON THE WATER: the prison-fortress of SAN QUENTIN.
ON THE CUT, JESUS MARTINEZ sits.
29, only a few years older than when we saw him but looks bad.
Glass wall divide them.
MICK I'm not going to ask you how you are because I know.
MICK Martinez glares at him, then spits on the floor.
MICK (CONT'D) Look.
MICK (CONT'D) I need to ask some questions.
MARTINEZ you didn't have no questions then.
MARTINEZ Never ask, Did you kill that girl?
MICK I am trying to make it right.
MICK Martinez is silent.
MICK Cold.
MICK (CONT'D) Tell me again about the Cobra Room.
MARTINEZ Tell you what?
The black-light Latina club, music, smoke-- In the middle is a pit iwith a BIG COBRA BASKET, out of which a girl in a snake costume emerges-- MARTHA.
Watching is MARTINEZ-- MARTINEZ (V.0.)
(cont'd) She was workin'.
Dancin'.
LATER, AFTER THE ACT-- Camera finds Renteria half-curling herself around MARTINEZ-- MARTINEZ (V.0.)
(cont' d) Then she came and talked to me...
She's whispering, Martinez is loving it-- MARTINEZ (V.0.)
(cont'd) She tol' me I could take her home.
I did, but I didn't kill her.
MICK (V.O.) You said there was another guy...
MICK (V.O.) Disentangling from Martinez, Martha slides toward a MAN, TALL, his back to us...
Si, she talk to him too, but she come back to me.
Though she's with the other man, she glances back at Jesus...
Mick opens his briefcase, takes out a stack of photos.
One by one holds them against the glass with his fingers...
WHEN:
Frustrated, Mick complies-- but calls--
MICK Guard!
MICK Long beat.
MICK Guard enters.
MICK Clean-Marine.
MICK Mick shows the stack.
MICK (CONT'D) I need him to look at these.
GUARD You can't give him anything.
MICK But if you won't let him close to the glass, how can he see them?
GUARD That's not my problem.
MICK All right, but can you stay a minute?
MICK If he IDs one of these mug- shots I need you to witness it.
GUARD Don't drag me into your bullshit.
GUARD And goes.
MICK Godammit.
MICK Try.
MICK See if one is the guy.
MICK Mick holds up one after another.
MICK Martinez shakes his head no-- Then the booking photo of Louis Roulet.
Mick holds it up.
Off Jesus, as his eyes narrow...
PRE-LAP the YELPING/SNARLING of a small /fierce dog...
We're:
Raul in shorts, lets Mick in over the barks of his Shih-Tzu.
RAUL Cool it, Ahab...
RAUL C'mon in, Mick...
RAUL Leaves Mick alone while he puts out the dog-- Mick cools his heels.
RAUL Takes in: Cubs pennant, Raul's old peaked policeman's cap, mounted...
RAUL finally pours himself a vodka.
RAUL Notes the photo of a YOUNGER GUY, its frame hung with the "Fight Aids" ribbon.
RAUL Raul re-enters.
MICK I helped myself.
RAUL It's okay.
RAUL I owe you, the way I let you down on that discovery file--
MICK It wasn't you.
MICK The cops set you up.
MICK Who was it slipped you the file, anyway?
RAUL Some guy in vice I play cards with.
RAUL Lonnie Fry.
RAUL You don't know him.
MICK You're right, I don't.
MICK But I know who his partner was, when he was in homicide.
MICK Kurlen.
RAUL That prick.
RAUL I'll make him sorry.
MICK Don't bother.
MICK We've got bigger problems.
MICK The way Mick says it.
MICK Raul sits, asks--
RAUL Like what?
RAUL Where were you today anyway?
RAUL You were hard to reach...
MICK Cell phones don't work too well where I was.
MICK Raul waits.
MICK Knows this is why Mick came here.
MICK (CONT'D) I came to tell you a story.
MICK (CONT'D) About Jesus Martinez.
RAUL You were at San Quentin.
MICK It's about what happened after he left Martha Renteria's apartment.
RAUL After he killed her?
MICK He never killed her.
MICK He went there, had sex, flushed the condom--
RAUL Wiped his prick on the pink towel--
MICK And then went home.
MICK The story starts after he left.
The real killer.
MICK The real killer.
MICK She lets him in.
MICK Maybe he fakes like it's still Martinez and he forgot something.
MICK Or maybe it was an appointment...
MICK We see the door open but we don't see who enters...
The other guy from the club?
The one Jesus said he bid against?
Right.
He comes in, punches her a few times to soften her up...
Renteria staggers as she's suddenly pummeled, then spun...
NICK (V.0.)
(cont'd) Then takes out a knife and holds it to her neck while he walks her to the bedroom...
We SEE the knife-tip against her throat...
MICK (V.0.)
(cont'd) Only she isn't lucky like Reggie Campo will be.
He climbs on top, puts on a condom, rapes her...
CUT TO, BEDROOM, as Mick gives us the action...
MICK (V.0.)
(cont'd) And when he's done he stabs her over and over, fifty-two times, while he works out something in his sick fucking mind.
We SEE, the stabbing, bleeding, then--
MICK Do you need to ask what kind of knife it was, based on the wounds?
RAUL A short-blade folding knife...
MICK Or whose face Martinez picked out of the mug-shots I brought him?
MICK No.
MICK No need.
MICK A beat.
MICK Raul's dog barks from outside.
MICK (CONT'D) Of course the story goes on from there.
MICK (CONT'D) From there it's about the lawyer Martinez gets himself...
RAUL Don't do this to yourself...
MICK The lawyer who just assumes he did it because of the DNA.
MICK The lawyer who gets him the best deal he can, and feels pretty good, because the deal keeps his client off Death Row...
MICK and this guy, this lawyer, he's all about the deal, see?
RAUL Mick-- You can't beat yourself up for what you didn't know--
MICK I just saw him and he's twenty-six going on forty.
MICK He's a little guy.
MICK You know what happens to the little ones up there.
MICK A beat.
MICK Mick drinks.
He has a type.
Roulet.
It's more than a type, Renteria and Campo, you put their faces together you get the same face...
RAUL You better take it easy...
MICK Listen, I was thinking about this the whole way down on the plane-- That night with Renteria?
MICK It was like he hit the jackpot-- got to do his thing and get away with it.
MICK Then he's in a bar, sees Reggie--
RAUL Who he's seen before, remember--
MICK Yeah but tonight he sees who she looks like.
RAUL Renteria?
MICK Right.
MICK And he's right back there.
Mick, we're talking about a really
MICK We're talking about a killer at work.
MICK You know that video from the bar?
MICK Just like you, he saw that Mr.
MICK X was left-handed.
RAUL Smart as the devil--
MICK He knows what he's doing.
MICK Reggie's the luckiest woman alive.
RAUL You think there are others?
RAUL With that face, or--
MICK You find out.
MICK Dig into Roulet.
MICK "All you'll find is parking tickets," I don't buy that anymore.
MICK Check out knife-murders of women.
MICK Not just the unsolved ones, Martha Renteria was a closed case.
RAUL Look man, I can't throw a net like that.
RAUL I'm just one guy!
RAUL You gotta bring the cops in.
MICK I can't.
MICK He's my client.
MICK That's why he hired me.
MICK Raul looks up, startled by this.
MICK Mick lays it out...
MICK (CONT'D) I was thinking about that on the plane too: He was worried I might hear about the case and put it together.
MICK (CONT'D) But if he was my client, I'd be bound to keep my mouth shut and protect him.
Attorney-client privilege.
MICK I told you: He knows what he's doing.
RAUL You got one guy in prison for what your other client did.
RAUL What are you going to do, Mick?
RAUL A beat.
MICK I'm working on it.
Lincoln in front.
Mick, working on Raul's question.
Trudges up the steps.
PHONE RINGS before he gets in, he fumbles keys--
MICK This is Haller...
MAGGIE'S VOICE Did you get my messages?
MICK Maggie, no, I was up in San Francisco for the day...
MAGGIE'S VOICE No you weren't.
MAGGIE'S VOICE You don't go to San Francisco, you go to San Quentin.
MAGGIE'S VOICE Must have been seeing a client...
MICK You always were too smart for me.
MICK Is Hayley okay?
MAGGIE'S VOICE She's good.
MAGGIE'S VOICE Look, she's playing soccer tomorrow, and she wants you to come to the match.
MAGGIE'S VOICE You've started something, Mickey...
MICK Fine, I look forward to it.
MAGGIE'S VOICE You'll need to pick her up at noon.
MAGGIE'S VOICE But, under this, he sees, DOWN THE HALLWAY, light from a room.
MAGGIE'S VOICE Sudden chill.
MAGGIE'S VOICE Angling to see, keeping a normal voice...
MICK Noon, I'll do that.
MICK See you then.
MICK And hangs up before she can say goodbye..
MICK And Stops.
MICK Freezes.
MICK Eyes on the LIGHT at the end of the hall.
MICK Carefully, Mick begins to move down the hall...
MICK Pauses at the door he comes to first, bedroom, dark...
MICK Kicks it-- Nothing.
MICK starts walking again, when: there's a SOUND.
MICK Then silence.
MICK What was it?...
MICK Mick continues-- to-- The LIT ROOM: SIDE ANGLE, we see it's the den-- Mick braces--
And BURSTS IN SUDDENLY:
Sitting in Mick's chair, leg up on the desk...
MICK What the hell are you doing here?
LOUIS Funny thing is I've been here before.
LOUIS I was offered the house to show, never gave back the key--
MICK Get out of my house!
MICK Now!
But, sees Mick noticing-- the ELECTRONIC ANKLET on his leg--
LOUIS (CONT'D) Your friend Valenzuela put this on.
LOUIS (CONT'D) A tracer.
LOUIS (CONT'D) As if I were going anywhere.
MICK I said Get up!
MICK Get up and get out of this house!
MICK Off Mick's force, Mick's almost crazy-- Louis smirks, goes--
LOUIS (turns to him, to
I couldn't reach you!
I'm on trial for my life, Mick, and I get nervous when I can't reach yout And you were away all day.
Like you told "Maggie."
Meaning he listened to the call.
Mick goes white.
MICK You don't come near this house again, do you understand me?
MICK We aren't friends, we aren't partners, you're my client, eriod--
LOUIS Just what I wanted to remind you of.
LOUIS I'm your client.
Mick reacts.
Louis lets in sink in, then:
LOUIS (CONT'D) Besides, I like it in your house, Mick...
LOUIS (CONT'D) Pretty pictures of your kid, Hayley...
MICK Fucken don't.
LOUIS Don't what, don't say she's pretty?
LOUIS But I saw her, the other day at the club...
LOUIS At which, Mick's had enough: belts Louis in the mouth.
LOUIS Quick, solid.
His lip bloodied, Louis flashes with anger-- but then, just as suddenly, he steels himself.
Glares coldly at Mick.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Okay.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Okay I'm going.
LOUIS (CONT'D) But-- And extends his hand: with Mick's house-key in it.
LOUIS (CONT'D) --first I think I should give you back your key.
LOUIS (CONT'D) It isn't right that I have it.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Now that we can trust each other.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Mick takes the key.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Panting, he watches Louis go down the fucking steps.
Hayley, defending, scrambles to get in the way of another girl, a forward, dribbling towards her...
ANGLE MICK, on the sideline...
among other parents...
MICK That's it, Hayley, get in her way!
MICK Hayley isn't quick enough, the forward dribbles round her, goes in for the score.
MICK Hayley looks despondently at Mick--
MICK (CONT'D) It's okay, honey!
MICK (CONT'D) When-- his CELL-PHONE RINGS.
MICK (CONT'D) Into it--
MICK (CONT'D) This is Haller...
MICK (CONT'D) He strains to listen...
MICK (CONT'D) Stops cold.
MICK (CONT'D) His look darkens...
MICK (CONT'D) Even from the field, Hayley sees this...
MOVING ON THE CUT, WITH MICK, as he ENTERS...
It's a CRIME SCENE, swarms with cops, forensics, technicians...
Mick distressed, moves as if through heavy water.
DETECTIVES are leading him: LANKFORD, 38, clean-marine-- and HEIDI SOBEL, 30.
They wear paper booties, thin rubber gloves...
LANKFORD Levin was back in his office...
SOBEL We wouldn't have found him if a neighbor hadn't brought the dog back.
SOBEL It was running loose.
LANKFORD Your name's all over this.
LANKFORD Were you the only guy he worked for?
MICK No, but I've got a big trial next month, attempted rape and murder.
MICK He was helping me.
SOBEL Is that the Roulet case?
MICK How did you know?
SOBEL Because every file that's been rifled has the name.
LANKFORD Only thing, Roulet himself is already cleared for this.
LANKFORD We've checked the tracking on his tracer- anklet and it doesn't show him anywhere near this place.
LANKFORD And there's no way to trick those things, no way in the world.
LANKFORD We see Mick register this-- wants to ask about it, but before
LANKFORD (CONT'D) By the way, Counsellor, where were you this morning?
LANKFORD (CONT'D) Mick rocked by the question.
LANKFORD (CONT'D) What it means.
MICK I'm a suspect?
SOBEL He knew whoever shot him.
SOBEL There are no signs of forcible, he even let the killer into the back room.
MICK I was watching my daughter play soccer.
MICK A couple of dozen people can confirm I was there.
MICK Provisionally buying this, Lankford takes out booties.
LANKFORD Put these on and don't touch anything back there.
Raul face down on the floor, in front of his desk chair.
SOBEL Can you tell us if you see anything unusual?
SOBEL Mick draws close.
SOBEL Lankford, abruptly--
LANKFORD All I see are pictures of a guy.
LANKFORD Was he a fruit?
He was a hell of an ex-cop, is what he was.
Crimes Against Persons, back in Chicago.
And yeah he was gay, and what the hell's that got to do with it?
If the murder was some kind of gay thing, why'd they ransack the office?
Isn't it obvious they were looking for something to do with his work?
Lankford can't argue with this.
When Sobel, near the body:
SOBEL Look.
SOBEL The position of his hands.
SOBEL ANGLE: Two middle fingers point down.
SOBEL Two outside fingers up.
LANKFORD Was this guy a Longhorns fan or what?
LANKFORD Or is it some kind of sign, like he was trying to tell us who
--"The devil did it?"
Seen from the POV OF--
He drives the street, his focus pumped up...
until he comes to: A HOUSE, its garage door wide open.
Mick pulls into the drive behind it...
What he FINDS inside, beside a family van, is a LARGE THIN CARDBOARD BOX...
It's upright, marked "Fragile."
Mick stands there KNOCKING at the door.
It's opened by:
VAL Hey Mick!
VAL Val's surprised...
VAL a mix of emotions...
VAL (CONT'D) What're you doin' here?...
VAL (CONT'D) and I heard about Raul Levin, man...
MICK You know your garage door's open?
VAL Shit: I just had a plasma delivered...
VAL And rushes to...
VAL the GARAGE.
VAL Mick trails...
VAL Val's relieved to find the box is okay.
VAL (CONT'D) Oh man, if we still lived in Van Nuys this sucker'd be gone.
VAL (CONT'D) Set me back eight grand, too.
VAL (CONT'D) But it's gonna be great for the games...
VAL (CONT'D) What's up anyway?
VAL (CONT'D) What brings you out here?
MICK Raul's murder.
MICK I've been with the cops.
MICK They can't tie Roulet to it, because your ankle bracelet doesn't put him near the house.
VAL I know, I gave them the trace.
VAL The bracelet's got a mass detector, there's no way to beat that.
MICK Did the cops ask you where you were this morning, Val?
MICK Val's slow at first, to register just what Mick's asking...
MICK (CONT'D) Somehow, some way, Louis killed Raul Levin.
MICK (CONT'D) And it didn't show up on the trace.
MICK (CONT'D) Mick looks at the plasma TV, then back at Val.
MICK (CONT'D) Val reddens--
VAL You better not be sayin' what I think-- that I cut him loose-- to let him kill Raul--?
MICK Maybe you didn't know what he was going to do--
VAL You think I'd let that happen?
VAL For a fuckin' TV?
VAL And he lunges at Mick, shoves him back agains the van, Mick shoves back, harder, backwards into the TV box-- it hits the cement floor, hard, and Val falls on top of it-- Sickening snap/crunch from within the box--
VAL (CONT'D) Shit, man--
MICK Where'd you get the money for an eight thousand dollar TV, Val?
VAL That's bullshit!
VAL I didn't do that!
VAL How dare you say that to me-- I'm inocente, man-- Mick reacts to the word-- Martinez's word-- as Val glares at him from the ground.
VAL (CONT'D) Get outa here; Get out of here, Mick, and get outa my life!
VAL (CONT'D) Mick's already backing off-- towards the car--
VAL (CONT'D) Keep going, man!
VAL (CONT'D) Mick keeps going-- down the drive and into his car-- CUT TO,
Drinking, CAMERA moves on him, he taps the glass for another.
Bartender comes over like he's going to pour one.
Mick's keys are on the bar-- Instead of pouring the bartender swipes the keys.
Mick looks at him, uncomprehending.
That's it.
You're done here, pal.
And you're not driving either.
Call yourself a cab or something.
Off Mick,
MAGGIE, lugs him into his room, he's a mess...
MAGGIE Being married to you sucked but it beat being a car service...
MICK That's the idea, y'know.
MICK Car service, with the Lincolns-- Drive the illustrious turds of our city back and forth to LAX--
MAGGIE I'll be your first customer.
MAGGIE First dollar.
And rolls him onto the bed.
He looks at her.
Drunk as he is:
MICK Lemme ask you something.
MICK Corliss.
MICK The name Corliss.
MICK You didn't just give me that just because you'd been drinking.
MICK You wanted me to have it.
MICK She doesn't confirm or deny.
MICK Just gets him into bed-- says
I'm not staying.
He knows, but-- one thing more--
MICK Maggie-- Raul.
MICK Did I get him killed?
MICK Moved, she shakes her head no.
MICK Straightens his pillow.
MAGGIE How do you do it, Haller?
MAGGIE You're a sleazy defense lawyer with two ex- wives and a daughter, and we all still love you.
We STAY ON HIM as she stands up, goes.
To no one:
MICK I can't do this anymore.
He's in bad shape as he comes out of the bedroom.
Stares at the light pouring in from the glass doors onto the porch.
Finds: THERE'S A DOLLAR TAPED TO THE GLASS.
(From Maggie.)
Also: the MESSAGE LIGHT ON HIS PHONE is ON.
MOMENTS LATER: He's pressed the button, listens to...
Message received: YESTERDAY, ELEVEN-
RAUL'S VOICE Mick, it's me.
RAUL'S VOICE Guess I missed you.
RAUL'S VOICE Wanted to go over a few things, so I wouldn't interrupt your day with Hayley.
RAUL'S VOICE Anyway...
RAUL'S VOICE Presses STOP.
RAUL'S VOICE Raul's voice: Mick's not sure he can deal.
RAUL'S VOICE But pulls the pencil & pad near him, and presses START again...
RAUL'S VOICE RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd) First, that witness name you gave me.
RAUL'S VOICE Corliss?
RAUL'S VOICE Turns out he's this hype, Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss, sometimes goes by "DJ."
RAUL'S VOICE When you run it that way you find out he's played the courtroom snitch a lot, mostly in Arizona.
RAUL'S VOICE But here's the thing: One time down there?
RAUL'S VOICE It blew up on him.
RAUL'S VOICE I'm working on it, it can be good for us...
RAUL'S VOICE Don't know how we get to him, though.
RAUL'S VOICE They put him in USC lock-up, just to make it harder...
RAUL'S VOICE Under which Mick, excited, is writing down D J CORLISS...
RAUL'S VOICE ARIZONA...
RAUL'S VOICE then USC, circles this last...
RAUL'S VOICE RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd) Other thing is, you asked me to dig deep-on Roulet?
RAUL'S VOICE Mick, I found something.
RAUL'S VOICE I found Martinez' ticket out of the Q.
RAUL'S VOICE When, on the tape he hears DOG BARKING...
RAUL'S VOICE and a DOOR BELL...
RAUL'S VOICE RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd) Uh, that's somebody at the door...
RAUL'S VOICE Look, have a good time with your kid.
RAUL'S VOICE Gotta go, boss.
RAUL'S VOICE And MESSAGE goes OFF.
RAUL'S VOICE Mick thinks a moment.
RAUL'S VOICE Tries to clear his head.
RAUL'S VOICE Then pulls out a card and dials a number...
Detective Sobel.
It's me.
Haller.
MICK (CONT'D) Look, I-- just checked my phone messages.
MICK (CONT'D) It turns out Raul called me.
MICK (CONT'D) Just before he was killed.
MICK (CONT'D) I didn't know.
The message came at Eleven-oh- seven.
He said, "I think I found Martinez' ticket out of the Q."
Meaning Jesus Martinez-- that's a former client of yours--
MICK In San Quentin.
MICK Right.
SOBEL Did he say anything else?
SOBEL Looks down at his notes.
SOBEL At "Corliss."
SOBEL "USC."
SOBEL A beat.
SOBEL As he tears off the note, stuffs it in his pocket...
MICK No-- No, that's it.
MICK Then the dog barked, somebody was at the door.
MICK He hung up.
MICK Look, maybe you can tell me if there's any progress on the case.
MICK He was my friend.
MICK Sobel, makes a decision...
SOBEL Well, we did catch a break.
SOBEL We found a bullet casing in the room, from a 22.
SOBEL It turns out Levin owned a .22, but when we checked it out it wasn't a Woodsman, like the gun that killed him...
SOBEL To which, Mick reacts...
SOBEL as she goes on...
SOBEL (CONT'D) The other thing is we can't find his cell-phone...
SOBEL (CONT'D) Are you still there?
MICK Yeah...
MICK just, I'll let you know if I think of anything.
MICK About his cell- phone, I mean.
MICK Thanks.
MICK And hangs up.
MICK Too sudden.
MICK Leaves Sobel wondering...
Down the hall, to a closet, climbs clumsily above to a shelf-- Tossing clothes out of the way...
Finds: AN OLD WOODEN GUN BOX.
The top has a brass plate: COLT "WOODSMAN."
Mick, in a cold sweat, opens the box.
It's EMPTY.
Suddenly--
For air-- He can hardly breathe-- straightens his thoughts-- Takes the note from his pocket, studies it.
GUARD leads him DOWN A HALL...
leads him to a room and leaves him there.
With GLORIA.
In prison jumper.
Faint smile.
MICK Gloria I'm not here about you.
MICK I'm here about me.
MICK I need your help.
Louis, lanky, graceful, takes a seat at the DEFENSE TABLE.
Mick, sorts papers.
Louis, turns, seems to watch him...
ANGLES, THE GALLERY: DOBBS and MARY WINDSOR, she's on edge but hides-- Also LORNA, to support Mick.
While, AT THE TABLE:
LOUIS Mick.
LOUIS I want to tell you something before we start.
MICK Better make it fast.
LOUIS You're my lawyer, right?
LOUIS So I can tell you anything, even a crime I've committed, and you have to keep it secret.
MICK That's right.
MICK Unless it's one you're going to commit.
LOUIS I've killed people, Mick.
LOUIS Reaction Mick.
LOUIS Just then, Courtroom clerk gives a warning--
COURTROOM CLERK Two minutes, people...
Now?
Now?
Why now, are you telling me this...
LOUIS Because I know your plan.
LOUIS Mick looks at him.
LOUIS Before he can deny--
LOUIS (CONT'D) Your plan is to defend me on this-- then, when I'm not your client, throw me to the cops.
LOUIS (CONT'D) I can't let that happen.
LOUIS (CONT'D) So I'm telling you: I've killed people and guess what?
LOUIS (CONT'D) Martha Renteria was one of them.
LOUIS (CONT'D) There now.
LOUIS (CONT'D) If you use what I've told you you might get Jesus Martinez out of jail, but you'll never practice law again.
LOUIS (CONT'D) And I'll never be prosecuted.
LOUIS (CONT'D) I think it's called fruits of the poisoned tree--
MICK Come with me.
MICK Cuts Louis off, rises, leads him...
MICK past prosecution table, TED MINTON turns, watches them...
MICK as Mick leads Louis out to--
He suddenly spins on Louis and puts him against a wall.
MICK You son of a bitch.
MICK You killed Raul.
LOUIS You're right about one thing.
LOUIS I am a son of a bitch.
MICK How did you do it?
MICK The trace said you weren't even in Glendale...
LOUIS He was getting too close.
MICK You piece of shit, do you think you have this wired?
MICK You don't!
LOUIS I do have an insurance policy.
LOUIS He grabs Mick's wrists.
LOUIS Strong: pulls them off his chest.
MICK I want my gun, Louis--
LOUIS I walk away from this trial a free man-- and remain free-- and it never falls into wrong hands.
LOUIS The deal.
LOUIS Mick's close to hitting him-- when the door opens--
COURTROOM CLERK Judge Fullbright is on the bench.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Nice of you to join us...
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT She's 46, bad hair, tough.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mick's off on the wrong foot.
MICK I'm sorry, your honor.
TED What this case is about is a predator...
TED On the night of March Sixth, Louis Roulet was out stalking his prey...
TED Jury of twelve, two alternates...
TED (CONT'D) You are going to hear from the victim herself about her lifestyle, one that we would not condone.
TED (CONT'D) But remember that anyone, anyone, can be the victim of a violent crime.
TED (CONT'D) The case is clear.
TED (CONT'D) Straightforward.
TED (CONT'D) A man attacked a woman in her home in order to rape and kill her.
TED (CONT'D) It is only by the grace of God that she's here to tell you the story.
TED (CONT'D) Over Ted,
MICK (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
MICK (CONT'D) My name's Michael Haller, and I'm representing Louis Roulet.
MICK (CONT'D) Mr. Minton doesn't want to use the word prostitute for the woman who's supposed to be Louis's victim.
MICK (CONT'D) He needn't worry, this case isn't about how she makes her money...
MICK (CONT'D) But it is about her actions.
MICK (CONT'D) How she saw a young man with signs of wealth, and chose to target him...
MICK (CONT'D) What she didn't count on, was you.
MICK (CONT'D) The fact that you'd put two and two together, and let your common sense tell you who was the real predator.
As Mick exits with Lorna for the lunch-break.
Low-voiced--
LORNA You had a message from Gloria.
LORNA She thinks she can do what you asked.
MICK Thinks?
LORNA Corliss has the same meal time.
LORNA She can try.
Let her try.
But it may not matter.
LORNA What do you mean?
MICK I mean, Corliss isn't on the witness list.
MICK It could be Ted Minton is holding him back.
MICK He won't use him until he has to.
MICK Until I screw up his case so bad he has no choice.
LORNA Mickey?
LORNA Can you do that?
LORNA Off Mick, tries for a confident smile...
I'd describe Ms. Campo when we got there as...
hurt and frightened...
TED Frightened?
OFFICER MAXWELL She kept asking us if she was safe, even after Roulet was taken away.
Mick has Maxwell on cross...
Clerk hands her pages...
MICK Officer, would you read from your arrest report where it's marked?
OFFICER MAXWELL "The victim does not know the man who assaulted her or why she was attacked."
MICK Why did you write that she didn't know him?
OFFICER MAXWELL Because that's what she said.
MICK So, she just opened the door at ten o'clock to a stranger?
OFFICER MAXWELL She didn't put it like that...
MICK Was there blood on his right hand?
OFFICER MAXWELL No, his left.
OFFICER MAXWELL Or we would have bagged his right one, too.
As a new witness is on the stand, Ted's witness...
TED Mr. Talbot, you were with Miss Campo on the night of March Sixth?
TED CHARLES TALBOT, 48, the customer from the video.
TED Blurred tattoos on muscled forearms, dyed blonde hair.
TALBOT Yep.
TALBOT Had a date with her at Morgan's.
TALBOT Then from there we went to her place and had another date, if you know what I mean.
Air of a sleaze-ball sex-player, but calm and good-humored.
TED Had you known Miss Campo before?
TALBOT Nope.
TALBOT Just called her up.
TED How did you know to call her?
TALBOT From her website.
TALBOT She's got a real good website.
TALBOT Jury laughs a little.
TALBOT Fascinated but repulsed by this guy...
TALBOT but Fullbright stirs, disliking Talbot's tone...
TED Did you have sexual relations?
TALBOT Four hundred bucks worth.
TALBOT And she earned every cent.
TALBOT Angle a male JUROR, red-faced with disapproval.
TALBOT Mick catches his reaction, likes it.
TALBOT Ted goes on...
TED And what time did you leave?
TALBOT About five minutes before ten.
TED She say she had another engagement?
TALBOT No, she acted like she was done for the night...
MICK Objection, I don't think Mr.
MICK Talbot's qualified to interpret Ms.
MICK Campo's thinking or plans...
TALBOT I just mean she acted satisfied...
Sustained!
Go on, Mr. Minton.
TED When you left, what condition was she in?
TED Was she hurt?
TALBOT No, she was fit as a fiddle.
TALBOT I know because I'd just played her.
TALBOT Sorry, your honor.
TALBOT She was fine.
TALBOT Minton goes, lifts a sheet over an easel, REVEALS the blown- up PHOTOS of the Reggie's battered face.
TED She didn't look like this?
TALBOT Man.
TALBOT What kind of bastard does something like that?
FULLBRIGHT Answer the question.
TALBOT No.
TALBOT We made consensual and pleasurable love.
TALBOT Which is what life is all about.
TALBOT Then I paid her.
MICK Mr. Talbot, are you right or left- handed?
TALBOT Left.
MICK Left.
MICK And isn't it true that before you left Regina Campo asked you to strike her repeatedly in the face?
Your honor, there's no basis for this sort of questioning.
Mr.
Haller is just muddying the waters with outrageous statements.
Fullbright looks to Mick for a reply.
Mick half-shrugs...
MICK Part of the defense theory, Judge.
FULLBRIGHT The witness can answer.
TALBOT I never hit her or any other woman.
MICK Do you know a prostitute named...
MICK Shaquille Barton?
MICK "Shaquilla Shakels" is her work name.
TALBOT Okay, yeah.
TALBOT I seen her one time...
MICK And if I brought her here and she said you had struck her with your left hand...
TALBOT She'd be lying.
TALBOT I tried Shaquilla, that rough stuff's not for me.
TALBOT I'm a missionary man.
MICK With a strong left.
MICK Thank you.
MICK And Mick sits-- drawing a nasty look from Ted for this last, and a pleased one from Louis.
MICK CUT TO,
Where Mick, as he exits the courtroom for the day, is
HIM.
Sobel holds documents.
Reaction Mick: Oh shit.
Mick looks over the pages Sobel hands him.
Lankford drives.
MICK This warrant is bullshit--
LANKFORD Good enough to search your house.
LANKFORD For a Woodsman registered to you.
SOBEL We need to run ballistics on it.
She turns around: The good cop, but she's hurt:
SOBEL (CONT'D) It would have been better if you'd told me that you had a Woodsman.
MICK I don't anymore.
MICK It was stolen.
MICK The worst yet.
MICK Lankford laughs: "How convenient..."
The BOX FOR THE WOODSMAN: Sobel in gloves, examines, while--
LANKFORD We got the history on the piece.
LANKFORD Turns out it belonged to Mickey Cohen the gangster, in the forties.
MICK I know.
MICK My father represented him.
MICK He got him off for using it in self- defense, so Cohen made him a present of it.
MICK Sobel, careful, opens it...
MICK It's empty.
MICK Like Mick said.
SOBEL Why didn't you report it stolen?
MICK Because I knew who took it.
MICK A client.
MICK He told me, so I couldn't turn him in without breaking a trust.
MICK They do that.
LANKFORD Still and all, mind if I look around?
LANKFORD Just in case you haven't had time to toss it off a pier?
MICK Go crazy.
MICK You've got the warrant.
MICK Lankford sneers, starts for the next room.
MICK To Sobel--
LANKFORD Heidi-- bag the box.
LANKFORD He leaves.
LANKFORD As she bags it-- He wonders why.
MICK You can't do ballistics on a box.
MICK She glances, seeing Lankford's gone-- explains.
SOBEL That old Mickey Cohen shooting?
SOBEL It's kind of famous.
SOBEL It turns out the county still has the evidence in storage.
SOBEL The bullet.
MICK You can match casings to a slug that's fifty years old?
SOBEL It'd be easier with the gun, but yeah.
SOBEL She goes to join her partner.
SOBEL Mick stops her with--
MICK Detective?
MICK How long will ballistics take?
SOBEL Careful.
SOBEL You'll make me think you're worried what we'll find.
MICK I'm in the middle of a trial.
SOBEL A day.
SOBEL Maybe forty-eight hours.
SOBEL She leaves.
SOBEL Mick's gaze, in the mirror: Fear.
Mick and Ted, at the same time.
As they move to the front...
TED Morning, Haller.
TED Word is, you had interesting visitors last night...
MICK Worry about yourself, Ted.
MICK You're dying the death of a thousand razors up there and you don't even know it.
MICK They peel off-- Mick to the defense table, where Louis waits for him.
MICK Before Louis can speak: Low--
MICK (CONT'D) Listen, you little shit: This gun- scheme of yours is about to blow up, and I'm not going down for it.
MICK (CONT'D) If I have to drive people to the airport the rest of my life.
MICK (CONT'D) Mick is seething.
MICK (CONT'D) Louis smiles.
MICK (CONT'D) Unruffled.
TED One last witness, your honor.
TED The prosecution calls Regina Campo.
Diminutive, conservative dress, dark curls around her pretty face-- none of the aggressive sexiness.
Hesitant but frank.
REGGIE It's true that I lied.
REGGIE I knew him when he came to the door.
TED In fact, you'd arranged his coming Miss Campo: why did you lie?
REGGIE I was scared.
REGGIE I wasn't sure the police would believe me and I wanted to make sure they arrested him...
REGGIE because he's an animal...
REGGIE She looks tentatively at Louis, as if still scared-- then she looks away.
REGGIE Louis is blank.
REGGIE Mick takes it in.
REGGIE Ted follows up--
TED Do you regret that decision now?
REGGIE Yes.
REGGIE If it helps him to get free and do this to somebody else.
MICK Your honor, prejudicial--
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Sustained.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT But ANGLE THE JURY: the damage is done.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Reggie's moved them.
TED I have no further questions for Regina, your honor.
TED Ted sits.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Your witness, Mr. Haller.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mick about to rise when-- Louis grabs his hand.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Low-voiced----
LOUIS I want to remind you of your words.
LOUIS You were going to tear her apart and throw her entrails into the sea.
MICK That's it, keep acting like you pull the strings.
LOUIS I do.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Haller.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Emphatic.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mick frees his hand, straightens himself.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT watched by Louis.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Then all at once, to surprise her--
MICK Ms. Campo have you engaged an attorney to sue Mr. Roulet for the events of March Sixth?
REGGIE (recovers, No I haven't.
MICK But have you talked to an attorney?
REGGIE I haven't hired anybody or--
MICK I asked if you talked to one.
MICK About a possible lawsuit.
MICK Mick's crisp like he knows for sure.
MICK She wilts a little.
REGGIE It was nothing more than talk...
MICK Did you ask if you could sue Mr.
MICK Roulet for damages?
REGGIE I thought what you say to lawyers is private.
MICK If you wish, you can tell the jurors.
MICK Faces her.
MICK Ted squirms, seeing the box she's in.
REGGIE I think I want to keep it private.
REGGIE Ted squirms again.
REGGIE Wrong answer.
MICK Okay, let's go back to the night at Morgan's.
MICK Had you ever seen Louis Roulet before that night?
REGGIE Yes.
REGGIE There and other places.
MICK Ever noticed he wore a Rolex watch?
MICK Or that he drove one of two cars, a Porsche or a Range Rover?
REGGIE I never saw him driving.
MICK And what made you approach him?
REGGIE I knew he was in the life.
REGGIE You know.
REGGIE A player.
REGGIE I had seen him leave with girls who do what I do.
MICK With prostitutes.
MICK To go to a hotel, or their apartments...?
REGGIE I don't know where.
MICK So how do you know they left?
MICK Maybe they just went out for a smoke...
REGGIE Because they got in his car and drove away.
MICK But you just testified that you never saw Mr. Roulet drive!
MICK Now you saw him leave with a prostitute like yourself.
MICK Which is it?
MICK The contradiction rings round the room.
MICK Reggie, tries...
REGGIE I saw him get in a car but I didn't know what kind it was.
MICK Do you know the difference between a Porsche and a Range Rover?
REGGIE one's big and one's small, I guess.
REGGIE Reactions...
REGGIE Reggie shakes her head, knows she's not making it...
REGGIE But Mick, like he's just getting started...
MICK The women he left with, when you saw them again, had they been beaten or injured?
REGGIE I don't know, I didn't ask.
MICK But girls in your profession talk about customers, don't you?
MICK Warn each other if someone's a freak...
REGGIE Yeah, usually...
MICK And how many had warned you about Louis Roulet?
REGGIE None.
REGGIE No one.
MICK So you believed you'd be safe?
REGGIE I, thought he was a known quantity and I needed the money, so...
MICK So you thought he could solve your need for money?
MICK No?
MICK Isn't that why we're sitting here?
MICK Because you zeroed in on him?
REGGIE No!
REGGIE I mean yes, but not like that-- (looking round, a plea to
He attacked me, I swear!
The BAR TAPE, blown-up projection, SHOWS REGGIE PASSES LOUIS
ANGLE COURTROOM, ON REGGIE watching the tape.
Also JURORS, reacting, enthralled, and Mick watching them...
RESUME COURT, Mick signals the TECHNICIAN.
It goes OFF.
MICK What did the napkin say, Ms. Campo?
REGGIE My name and address...
MICK And your price?
REGGIE Yes.
REGGIE Four hundred dollars.
MICK It's a hard line of work...
REGGIE And dangerous.
MICK In fact, haven't you told friends you were looking for a way out?
REGGIE Yes.
REGGIE I'm not proud of what I do--
MICK And so, isn't it true-- nothing would be easier to understand-- that you saw Louis Roulet and his money as a way out?
REGGIE No!
REGGIE That's not what this is about!
REGGIE That man hit me and tried to kill me.
MICK Yes, we've heard you say that--
Judge may I ask the witness to stand up?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT The witness will stand.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT I hope you're going somewhere with this, Mr. Haller.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Reggie stands.
MICK Now if you please, walk over to my client.
MICK She goes, stands before Louis.
MICK Who rises on cue from Mick.
MICK (CONT'D) This is the man you broke free from, overpowered, knocked out?
REGGIE Yes-- You can do amazing things when you're afraid--
MICK How much do you weigh, Ms. Campo?
MICK Because your website REGGIE-FOR-FUN- DOT-COM says one hundred three...
REGGIE That's right.
REGGIE A beat.
REGGIE Louis sits.
REGGIE Reggie stands there...
REGGIE suddenly cries.
MICK I've got no further questions for the witness, your honor.
MICK Reggie returns to a seat behind the prosecutor's table.
MICK Where we pick up TED MINTON.
MICK Staring at Mick, hiding the sense of
damage as best he can...
He's startled when:
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Minton?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Do you have another witness for us?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Ted rouses, summons confidence, rises...
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT WHILE, ASIDE, Louis to Mick, re Ted...
LOUIS He looks worried.
LOUIS Mick watching Ted, waits, tense...
TED The state rests, your honor.
TED Mick's disappointed: No Corliss.
MICK Not worried enough.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Then the defense will call its first witness after lunch.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT And the gavel comes down.
MARY WINDSOR Yes, I recognize this knife.
MARY WINDSOR It's the one my son carried with him for protection for the last four years.
MARY WINDSOR Almost exactly.
MICK Why would he need protection?
MARY WINDSOR Because realtors alone in a house are sometimes robbed or hurt...
MARY WINDSOR Even raped or murdered.
MICK But has Louis ever been the subject of such a crime?
MARY WINDSOR No.
MARY WINDSOR But he knew someone who...
MICK Go on, please.
MARY WINDSOR She was raped and robbed by a man.
MARY WINDSOR Louis found her.
MARY WINDSOR It was terrible.
MARY WINDSOR The first thing he did afterwards was get himself a knife to carry, at all times.
MARY WINDSOR March Sixth would have been no different.
TED Mrs. Windsor, you seemed pretty exact, about when your son started carrying around this, this weapon, a five-inch folding knife...
MARY WINDSOR I am.
MARY WINDSOR The incident took place on June ninth, two-thousand-one.
MARY WINDSOR Mick watches Ted, carefully...
MARY WINDSOR Cat and mouse...
TED Was it in the newspapers?
MARY WINDSOR No.
TED Or, do you somehow remember because the police came to talk to Louis...
MARY WINDSOR There was no police investigation.
TED Then how can you remember the exact date so well?
TED Were you given the date before testifying here?
MARY WINDSOR I know the date because I'll never forget the day I was attacked.
MARY WINDSOR The news falls on Ted.
MARY WINDSOR She goes on before he can rally...
MARY WINDSOR MARY WINDSOR (cont'd) Louis will never forget it either.
MARY WINDSOR He found me in that house, tied up.
MARY WINDSOR Naked.
MARY WINDSOR It was traumatic for him.
MARY WINDSOR She's perfect: a strong woman, unused to showing emotion.
Mick smiles, impressed.
When, with some sarcasm:
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Minton-- anything else?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Ted, still thrown, stares down at his notes.
TED As Louis's mother, you'd do or say anything to save him, wouldn't you?
MARY WINDSOR I wouldn't lie.
MARY WINDSOR Not about what happened that day...
TED We have no police or hospital record that it even occurred...
MARY WINDSOR I never reported it...
TED Why not?
MARY WINDSOR I was ashamed.
MARY WINDSOR If you don't understand that I can't explain it to you.
MARY WINDSOR And yet I live with it every day.
But it's only you who says so: Mary looks at Ted, and at the Judge, as if confused:
MARY WINDSOR Is that a question?
MARY WINDSOR Off Mick, admiring, GO TO,
Mick packing his stuff-- looks up, as Ted approaches.
TED I've been thinking about the thousand razors.
Louis waits on the steps, Mick comes out.
Where they're alone...
MICK We've had an offer.
MICK Want to spend six months in county jail?
LOUIS I told you from the beginning--
MICK I know: The only verdict's Not Guilty.
MICK Okay.
MICK We'll get there.
Grateful for this, Louis puts a hand on Mick's arm.
But:
MICK (CONT'D) Don't touch me, Louis.
MICK (CONT'D) You want to show your gratitude give me my gun back.
MICK (CONT'D) Louis grins: meaning No way.
MICK (CONT'D) I thought so.
You still sure you want me to put you on the stand?
LOUIS I insist on it.
MICK Then get some rest tonight, you're up next.
MICK Leaving Louis, Mick continues down the steps, to where the Lincoln waits.
MICK He gets in.
Earl in the front seat.
MICK There's something I need you to get me, Earl.
MICK A tone Earl never heard him use before.
MICK Earl turns around.
Mick steps past Ted on his way to his desk.
As he passes--
TED Did you talk to your client?
MICK Yes.
MICK No deal.
Ted feigns surprise-but-acceptance...
While, TO THE JUDGE:
MICK (CONT'D) The defense calls Louis Ross Roulet, your honor.
LOUIS I turned toward the living room, the way she pointed...
LOUIS ANGLE MICK, has a floorplan of the apartment, on an easel.
MICK And what happened when you turned?
LOUIS Something hit me and I blacked out.
LOUIS I don't know for how long.
MICK That was all?
LOUIS Then when I woke up these guys were on me, telling me not to move.
LOUIS I couldn't anyway.
LOUIS I was too scared.
LOUIS Mick moves toward Louis, as if determined to find flaws...
MICK But, there was blood on your jacket and your left hand...
LOUIS Someone put it there because I didn't.
MICK Are you left-handed?
LOUIS No.
MICK You didn't strike Ms. Campo with your left fist?
LOUIS No!
MICK Threaten to rape her, or kill her?--
LOUIS No!
MICK You're angry.
MICK Why?
LOUIS Do you know what it's like to be accused of something like this?
LOUIS To listen to people tell lies about your having done something so sick and awful?
LOUIS I, I understand I had to be quiet and wait my chance and not say anything-- but if guilty people have rights, what about innocent people?
LOUIS I am innocent!
LOUIS Mick.
LOUIS Meets Louis's eye, communicates: You were perfect.
MICK Nothing further, Judge.
MICK Ted already up & moving, passes Mick as he takes his seat--
TED According to you, Ms. Campo punched herself or had a man she never met before punch her lights out as part of a set-up?
LOUIS All I know is that I didn't.
TED And this knife you always carry, how did she know she'd find it on you as part of the set-up?
She couldn't, could she?
I mean, I never took it out or showed it to anybody-- so she must have just found it when she went into my pocket for the money I had that I was going to pay her with, right?--
TED I'd really prefer it if I ask the questions, and you answer them!
TED Would you look at this, please-- Goes to the easel, REVEALS: PHOTO of Reggie's beaten face.
TED (CONT'D) Please tell us again if you think Regina Campo would or could have done this to herself.
LOUIS I don't know who did it, but it wasn't me.
LOUIS Nobody deserves that to happen...
TED What do you mean by "deserves?" Do you mean crimes of violence come down to a whether a woman gets what she "deserves?"
LOUIS I mean no matter what she does for a living or who she is-- No woman deserves that.
LOUIS Ted keeps staring at the photo: Wants the jury looking there.
TED I have no more questions.
TED At which, suddenly there's a wave of movement-- SLOW-MOTION-- Louis dismissed from the chair-- Ted returning to his seat, passing Mick as Mick rises-- Louis gives Mick a "How'd I do?" look, Mick nods, unmistakably, "You did fine..."
TED -- Mick's look finds Ted-- Mick and Ted holding each other in a gaze-- Mick's face in a kind of smile, Ted grim-- As Mick brings out, speaking to the Judge but his smiling eyes fixed on the unhappy Ted-- RESUME NORMAL SPEED for
Mick's confident, fateful words:
MICK Your honor, the defense rests.
Ted hears this, sets his jaw.
Fullbright turns to him.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Minton?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Ted is uncertain...
TED Your honor...
TED The state needs the night to decide, your honor...
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT To decide what?
TED Frankly I wasn't anticipating the defense would rest after two witnesses.
TED I-- I'd like the night to consider calling a rebuttal witness.
MICK Your honor, first we've heard of
TED I said `-consider."
TED I need to find out if the witness is even
MICK The state still has an obligation to disclose the identity--
TED Not if I decide not to use him.
TED I'm begging the court's indulgence, your honor.
TED Fulbright doesn't like it...
TED but weighs, yields.
TED Go to,
It's the vast view from Mick's porch.
He has a drink in his hand.
And holds a phone to his ear...
MAGGIE'S VOICE There's a rumor in the office...
MICK How I'm the one who shot Raul?
In the BG we SEE HAYLEY, in pajamas, jumping on her bed...
Maggie closes the bedroom door so she can speak...
MAGGIE Haller, is this serious?
MICK I'd say so.
MICK I'm being set up for his murder.
MICK Couple of detectives from Glendale are following me around, just waiting for the go- ahead to hit me with an arrest warrant...
MICK Could be any minute...
MAGGIE How is this possible?
MICK Bad timing, bad client, me being dumb...
MAGGIE Is it Roulet?
MAGGIE Is that the client?
MICK I can't talk to you about my clients.
MICK How is Hayley?
MAGGIE Fine.
MAGGIE But Haller, if she ever hears anything about this--
MICK She won't.
MICK Not if I play it right.
MAGGIE What are you going to do?
MAGGIE A long beat.
MAGGIE Then he says, just as he told Raul--
MICK I'm working on it.
MICK I have a plan.
CLOSE ON MICK, in the back seat.
Looking out at the rain.
His look a little different: close shave, neat suit.
Fade up sound of Earl, meanwhile, rattling on...
EARL .when Not Guilty Two gets to four thousand miles, that's two cars ready, that's enough to start the airport runs...
EARL Scene we saw at the opening.
EARL Mick absorbed...
EARL Earl notices...
You gettin' any of this, Mr.
Haller?
Mick opens the file (back-seat office extraordinarily neat).
Top of the print-out: THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA vs.
LOUIS ROULET...
Earl holds an umbrella over Mick, they hurry into the building...
The items in his briefcase checked, wand passed over him...
As he moves down the hall.
Everything counts today.
Enters:
Ted prepares at his table.
Look at each other without greeting-- as Mick moves to the CLERK, who shuffles papers...
MICK Bill, I'm getting coffee.
MICK Any for you?
CLERK BILL No man, I'm off caffeine...
MICK Hey, is that the custody list?
MICK Can I see if any of my no-good clients are on it?
MICK Bill lets him have it.
MICK Mick, casual, looks over the names...
LORNA, she's paying for a take-out coffee, when Mick scoops her up by the arm, urgent, he's been looking for her--
MICK Minton's putting on Corliss.
MICK He's got him in lock-up already...
LORNA But Gloria still hasn't let us know if she got to him!
MICK You said she had mealtimes to work it...
LORNA Yes but...
MICK I'll take my chances.
MICK Meantime did you serve Kurlen?
MICK Moving her OUT OF THE CAFE, DOWN THE HALL-- hushed & fast--
LORNA Yes but I didn't like forging the judge's signature...
MICK Yes you did.
LORNA Yes I did.
LORNA Just then, approaching, he sees SOBEL & LANKFORD: Are they coming for him?
LORNA No, they turn into the courtroom along with others showing up for the trial's last day.
LORNA Relieved--
MICK Now go, and be ready for my call.
MICK Lorna starts to go-- then pauses.
LORNA I'm crazy about the power suit.
LORNA Extra flip to her hips as she goes because Mick's watching.
No sooner enters than KURLEN's in his face, waves a document.
KURLEN What shit is this, Haller?
KURLEN I got nothing to do with your case!
KURLEN Mick, "innocent," inspects the papers.
KURLEN With surprise--
MICK Subpoena to appear as a witness?
MICK You'll just have to wait and see.
MICK It's a legal document, Detective.
MICK Cursing, Kurlen takes himself off to a corner.
MICK Leaving Mick with the "legal document."
MICK He tucks it away-- And continues to the front-- Past CECIL DOBBS and MARY
WINDSOR, to LOUIS, at the defense table.
OVER WHICH, PRE-LAP:
Mr. Minton--
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Does the state have any rebuttal?
TED The state calls Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss as rebuttal witness.
MICK Judge?
MICK Who is this witness?
MICK Why wasn't I told before now?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT A fair question.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Minton?
TED Dwayne Corliss is a cooperating witness who spoke with Mr. Roulet in custody, following his arrest.
LOUIS Bullshit!
LOUIS I didn't to talk to--
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Quiet, Mr. Roulet!
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Haller, control your client!
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mick bends over, to Louis, sotto voce--
MICK That was good.
MICK Now leave it to me.
MICK I do share my client's outrage, your honor.
MICK I'd at least like to know how long the state has been sitting on this testimony...
TED Mr. Corliss did not come forward until yesterday.
This is incredible...
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Do you want to go back and talk to him?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Given the timing I'd allow it.
MICK No, Judge, we all know what this is, this is a jailhouse snitch, and anything he'd say would be a lie--
TED That's groundless, your honor--
MICK --I just want my objection noted.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Then I'm going to rule he can
MICK Can I ask one indulgence?
MICK Can I step into the hallway and make a call to an investigator?
MICK For whatever good it will do at this late date.
Mick already dialling-- Lorna answering--
LORNA'S VOICE Yep, here.
MICK Put your watch at quarter of.
MICK At ten fifteen you enter the room.
LORNA'S VOICE Got it.
MICK With the printouts.
LORNA'S VOICE Mickey, I know the moves!
LORNA'S VOICE He snaps shut his cell-phone.
Prison jumpsuit.
We recognize him: the holding-cell junky.
TED Mr. Corliss, are you incarcerated at this time?
CORLISS Um, no, now I'm just in the courtroom.
CORLISS Dumb answer draws laughs.
CORLISS ANGLE LOUIS, seething...
TED But you are currently held in the jail-ward at USC hospital?
CORLISS Yes.
CORLISS Since I got arrested.
TED For burglary and drug possession?
CORLISS That's right.
TED Now.
TED Do you know the defendant?
CORLISS Yes.
CORLISS I met him in lock-up.
CORLISS We was bussed over from jail, and then we was together in the tank when we came for first appearance.
TED And did you talk at that time?
CORLISS Yes...
CORLISS we talked about how bad we needed cigarettes.
TED Anything else?
CORLISS You know, "what are you in for?" Like that.
TED Did he say what he was "in for?"
CORLISS He said, "For giving a bitch exactly what she deserved."
CORLISS Those were his words.
CORLISS Reaction Louis, stirs like a caged animal.
CORLISS Mick steadies...
TED I have only one more question.
TED Have I, or has anyone, made you promises to get you to testify?
CORLISS No.
CORLISS It's the right thing to do.
CORLISS Ted sits.
CORLISS Judge turns to Mick-- who's just staring, angrily.
CORLISS Then rises.
CORLISS Like he doesn't know what to do.
CORLISS Louis, the others, watch anxiously.
CORLISS Mick crosses to the front, steals a glance at the rear, SEES KURLEN standing against the wall, LANKFORD AND SOBEL seated in front of him.
CORLISS Then...
MICK How many times have you been arrested, Mr. Corliss?
CORLISS About seven in L.A. Couple of times in Phoenix if you count those.
MICK So you know how the system works?
CORLISS I try to survive...
MICK And sometimes that means ratting out fellow inmates, is that it?
TED Objection, your honor...
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Take a seat, Mr. Minton.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT I gave you leeway bringing this witness in.
MICK Thank you, your honor.
MICK But I'll rephrase: How many times have you snitched on an inmate?
MICK Testified against a fellow inmate for the prosecution?
CORLISS This makes my fourth.
Four times?
People just come up and tell you they committed crimes so you can testify against them--
CORLISS People talk to me.
CORLISS I'm a friendly guy.
CORLISS Mick, walks toward Louis, indicates him--
MICK So you and my client were friends--
CORLISS That's right, we was friendly--
MICK And he just said what you said he said, about what the woman "deserved," and then you went back to talking about cigarettes?
CORLISS Not exactly.
CORLISS He was like, bragging.
CORLISS He told me he did it before...
CORLISS Mick freezes...
CORLISS Like he's in a mine field and can't move...
CORLISS (CONT'D) He said the other time he killed the bitch...
CORLISS (CONT'D) He got away with it then and he would get away with it now.
MICK You...
MICK Wait...
MICK All eyes on Mick.
MICK The Judge prompts...
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Haller?
MICK No more questions, your honor.
TED Re-direct, your honor.
TED Fullbright nods permission.
TED While Louis leans over to Mick...
LOUIS What the hell is this?
MICK You tell me!
MICK What did you say to this guy?
LOUIS Nothing!
LOUIS This is a set-up!
LOUIS You're doing this!
MICK How?
MICK How am I doing this?
MICK But Louis has no answer.
MICK Meanwhile Ted's taken the floor...
TED You said he was bragging.
TED How?
CORLISS Well, like, he told me the details.
CORLISS About the other one, that he killed.
CORLISS (CONT'D) He called her a snake dancer.
CORLISS (CONT'D) She danced in some joint where she was like in a snake pit.
CORLISS (CONT'D) ANGLE, REACTION DETECTIVE KURLEN, he leans forward at this...
CORLISS (CONT'D) SAME TIME, REACTION at the defense table: Mick, "alarmed," low to Louis--
MICK How does he know this?
LOUIS Do you think I know?
MICK If you didn't tell him this shit somebody did.
MICK Who?
MICK Start thinking!
MICK RESUME Ted, moving closer to Corliss--
TED Is there anything else he told you?
CORLISS No, that snake-girl stuff was it.
TED Then no further questions, your honor.
TED Ted sits.
TED The look he gives Mick in passing is one of abounding confidence.
TED Mick stews...
TED Swivels around...
TED Covert glance, MICK'S POV, looks to see if Kurlen is where he was, against the wall.
TED He's not.
TED He's gone.
TED So is Lankford.
TED And the courtroom door still swings slightly, as if they've
just left...
While IN FRONT:
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Any re-cross from the defense?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mick rises to answer, hesitates-- and just then turns to see Lorna enter and approach down the aisle.
MICK A moment with my staff, Judge?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Be quick.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT He meets Lorna at the gate.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Brings his head close to hers--
LORNA This is where I whisper in your ear, tell you stuff...
MICK It's all here, right?
MICK You go now, I don't want anyone talking to you.
LORNA Damn.
She goes, he returns to the table.
Before Louis can speak:
MICK I don't know what's going on here, but it won't matter if it's two murders or a hundred if I can show he's a liar--
LOUIS If you set me up I swear I'll--
MICK Just tell me if there's anything else he knows.
MICK Anything else I have to stay away from.
LOUIS I don't know because I never talked to him.
LOUIS I'm not that stupid.
MICK It doesn't matter.
MICK If I destroy him none of it counts...
LOUIS Then destroy him.
LOUIS A command.
LOUIS Mick nods.
LOUIS Returns to the witness Corliss--
MICK Dwayne, if I can call you that--
CORLISS It's what people call me--
MICK Don't they also call you D.J.?
MICK For example, down in Phoenix, right?
CORLISS Maybe.
CORLISS He's a bit wary.
CORLISS Mick looks through the file Lorna brought--
MICK Because you know, my assistant, she was just reading on the internet about D.J. Corliss-- arrested in Phoenix, 1989 on drug charges-- Hometown of Mesa, Arizona?
CORLISS Yeah, that'd be me.
CORLISS But--
MICK You remember Fred Bentley, right?
MICK Corliss, darkens, stumbles at this-- Ted's quick--
TED I object, your honor, where is the defense going with this?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Connect the dots soon, Mr. Haller.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT But the witness can answer.
CORLISS I don't remember any Bentley--
MICK Sure you do.
MICK You testified that he confessed to you the crime he was charged with-- rape of a ten-year- old girl-- even though he denied his guilt in court.
MICK Am .I ringing any bells, D.J.?
CORLISS Uh-- 1989, I was high a lot, there's not much I recall--
MICK Then I'd like you to read this to us, D.J. It's a printout of a news story from the Arizona Star, 1997, that's eight years after he was convicted.
MICK I ask that it be admitted into evidence--
TED Your honor?
TED A news report?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Let's see where it takes us.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT The state can object later.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mick hands printout to the bailiff, who gives it to Corliss.
MICK I've marked the paragraph.
CORLISS I ain't too good at reading...
CORLISS "A man, Frederick Bentley, wrongly convicted of rape, was released Saturday after con--
--conclusive DNA results cleared him of the crime.
The case was bolstered at trial by testimony from an informant, D.J. Corliss of Mesa, who claimed Bentley had-- bragged to him about the rape while together in a holding cell--"
MICK That's enough.
MICK Were you charged with perjury for that incident, D.J.?
CORLISS No I was not.
MICK Was that because the police were complicit in your confession?
TED Judge, how can the witness know what went into the D.A.'s decision?
MICK Were you promised the same deal here, Mr. Corliss?
MICK To say that Louis Roulet "bragged" to you in the "holding cell?"
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Alright, Mr. Haller, that will do!
MICK Sorry.
MICK I have no more questions.
MICK And Mick sits.
MICK Courtroom's hushed.
MICK Until--
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT I'm excusing the jury for an early lunch.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Bailiff, see them out.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Maintains a smile as the jurors leave.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Then her smile dies.
No sooner through the door-- than Fullbright wheels on Ted:
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Minton do you know what you have done?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT You've put a documented liar on the stand, a man with a record of putting innocent people
TED Your honor, I--
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT You shut the fuck up when I'm talking to you!
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT I can think of nothing more prejudicial or corrupt than what I just saw out therel
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Do you realize what you've done to my trial?
As Mick and Ted exit into hall-- Ted hurrying off, angry-- Mick to LOUIS, DOBBS, and MARY WINDSOR-- tells them re Ted:
MICK He's going to see his boss.
MICK To decide what to do before the judge comes down with a directed verdict.
LOUIS What's a directed verdict?
MICK She takes it out of the jury's hand and declares an acquittal.
Oh my god...
MICK We'll know in a few minutes.
MICK And heads off.
MICK Louis's cold stare, watches him go...
Mick at the urinal.
Louis enters in and slides behind him.
LOUIS I'm not celebrating just yet, Mick.
MICK Yeah I can see that.
LOUIS I want to know how Corliss got that shit he was saying.
MICK Let it go.
MICK You're getting what you want, I'm getting you off...
LOUIS What I want is get off for good.
LOUIS Leans into him.
LOUIS Pushes a hand into his back.
LOUIS A threat.
LOUIS (CONT'D) You'd better understand that.
LOUIS (CONT'D) You've got enough reasons to be afraid of me already.
LOUIS (CONT'D) When-- DOOR OPENS-- the courtroom CLERK, BILL, enters.
CLERK BILL It's starting.
TED I just spoke to the District Attorney, your honor.
TED The state wishes to dismiss all charges.
TED Here's a motion...
TED Mick, Louis, watch Ted hand it to Fullbright...
TED (CONT'D) It acknowledges that the procedures which guarantee justice were not followed in this case...
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT This is a motion to dismiss with prejudice.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT No coming back.
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Ever.
Yes, your honor.
.tearful at the news, grips Mick's hand...
she and Dobbs...
MARY WINDSOR Mr. Haller, thank you for my son...
DOBBS You were splendid-- And Louis.
DOBBS Private, a few feet away.
DOBBS Smiles...
LOUIS I knew I wasn't wrong about you...
MICK I want the gun.
LOUIS Of course you do.
LOUIS No more can be said, because Mrs. Windsor-- descends on Mick--
MARY WINDSOR Mr. Haller, this time I insist you come to Orso for a celebration--
MICK I don't think so.
MICK Mary would insist, but before she can, OUT OF THE ELEVATOR comes KURLEN-- with LANKFORD AND SOBEL.
MICK Mick freezes, expects
the worst-- but they move AROUND him and CLOSE IN ON:
KURLEN Louis Roulet, you are under arrest.
KURLEN Turn around and place your hands behind your back.
LOUIS Mick?
LOUIS This shouldn't be happening.
LOUIS Mrs. Windsor rushes Kurlen-- Sobel tries forcing her back--
MARY WINDSOR No!
MARY WINDSOR Take your hands off my son!
LOUIS Mother.
LOUIS Louis' voice controls her.
LOUIS Stricken, Mary gives up.
LOUIS Then--
DOBBS What are you arresting him for?
KURLEN Suspicion of murder.
KURLEN The murder of Martha Renteria.
DOBBS That snake-dancer nonsense?
DOBBS Are you crazy?
DOBBS Everything that man Corliss said was a lie!
DOBBS Which stops Kurlen.
DOBBS He grins, confirmed.
KURLEN If it was all lies, how'd you know I meant the snake dancer?
KURLEN Dobbs sees his mistake.
KURLEN Kurlen begins again to take Louis--
MICK A moment with my client, Detective?
MICK Kurlen nods, why not.
MICK Mick leads Louis a few steps away.
MICK (CONT'D) This is it, Louis.
MICK (CONT'D) I got you off.
MICK (CONT'D) Now get yourself a new lawyer.
LOUIS You're forgetting I have the gun...
MICK Yeah, and you'll have to explain how you got it.
MICK But you know what?
MICK I've stopped giving a shit.
MICK You're going down, and Martinez is getting out, and that's all I care about.
MICK (CONT'D) When they stick that needle in your arm, that will be me.
LOUIS And what if I don't go down?
LOUIS But Mick's finished, ready to leave, though Louis persists...
LOUIS (CONT'D) Because I don't think they have enough to hold me.
LOUIS (CONT'D) I could be out by tomorrow...
LOUIS (CONT'D) You've got women, you've got a daughter...
LOUIS (CONT'D) At this, Mick's head snaps to him, angrily...
LOUIS (CONT'D) You can't protect everybody.
LOUIS (CONT'D) Kurlen arrives, takes Louis's elbow...
LOUIS (CONT'D) Mick's already moving to the elevators...
LOUIS (CONT'D) watched by SOBEL.
SOBEL catches up as MICK reaches the Lincoln.
Stops him.
They move to beneath an overhang, where they're almost dry.
MICK Please tell me you've got enough on Louis for the murder of Renteria.
SOBEL We will.
SOBEL We have the ticket.
MICK What ticket?
SOBEL The parking ticket, that Raul found.
SOBEL That was the phone message he left you...
SOBEL Raul checked.
SOBEL Louis got one at a meter outside the victim's place, same time she was murdered.
MICK What about Raul's murder?
MICK Do you have him for that?
SOBEL No.
SOBEL We still don't know how he could have slipped the tracer anklet.
SOBEL Haller?
SOBEL Leave it alone.
SOBEL He hesitates-- but goes.
SOBEL Into the rain.
SOBEL Gets into--
He watches Sobel hurry back to courthouse through rain.
When:
EARL Mr. Haller?
EARL Got that thing you asked for.
EARL And he hands Mick something wrapped in a towel: A GUN.
EARL Mick,
puts it away, in the armrest.
A bit regretful, because:
MICK I said I'd never do this.
MICK Ask you to violate your parole.
EARL It's called, lookin' out for your blood.
EARL Mick sits back.
EARL Earl pops in a RAP CD, TUPAC.
TUPAC "To be a man in this wicked land..."
HAND-HELD, MICK in windbreaker, jogging...
RAP continues...
AS RAP FADES, CAMERA TRAILS Mick's messy kitchen: take-out pizza, beer bottles...
and the GUN.
Barrel protrudes from under the thrown-aside windbreaker.
Mick's seen on the porch.
PHONE RINGS, he rushes into answer.
MICK Yeah?
MAGGIE'S VOICE Mick, it's Maggie...
MICK Uh-huh, I've been waiting for this.
MICK You're calling to congratulate me.
MAGGIE'S VOICE No, listen to me: Roulet is out!
What?
They've had him half a dayl
MAGGIE I know...
MAGGIE but the D.A. downtown said the detectives didn't have enough, they had to kick him...
MICK I knew it, they jumped the gun...
MICK dammit...
MAGGIE They've still got the parking ticket...
MAGGIE and they're working forensics on the knife...
MICK Maggie...
MICK Look...
MICK There's more to this.
MICK Louis knows about Hayley.
MAGGIE What are you saying?
MAGGIE How could you expose her to--
MICK I've got her picture in the house!
MICK He saw itl Where is she now?
MAGGIE On the schoolbus-- the sitter's on the way to pick her up on Ventura, near the house--
MICK Get her on the cell and tell her not to take Hayley home, keep her with her til you get there!
MICK How long will it take you?
MICK Call me when you've reached the sitter.
MICK He hangs up.
MICK Thinking-- then dials a number--
"VAL" VALENZUELA.
At his desk.
Answers...
VAL Valenzeula.
MICK Val it's me.
MICK Mickey Haller.
VAL I should hang up on you.
VAL The shit you talked to me!
MICK Don't hang up, Val!
MICK I need a favor--
VAL You got balls even askin'--
MICK --it's my family, Val.
MICK Maggie, Hayley-- they're in danger.
This is Roulet, right?
MICK Does he still have the ankle- bracelet on him?
VAL Yeah, he must, he didn't come by the office and I'm the only one can take it off...
MICK Then turn on the trace, Val.
MICK Now!
VAL I got him...
MICK Where is he?
VAL He's movin'...
VAL on Sunset...
MICK Is he coming to my house?
Could be, yeah, he's going west, heading up Laurel Canyon...
Mick, nods...
glance toward his gun...
Then...
PHONE BEEPS in his ear, Call Waiting--
MICK Stay there, Val--
MICK Maggie?
MAGGIE'S VOICE I reached the sitter, she'll keep Hayley at the bus-stop...
MICK Good.
MICK As soon as you've got her, take her somewhere safe.
MICK And call me.
MICK Where is he, Val?
VAL I see him but I don't know where he's goin'...
MICK What?
VAL He's not goin' to your house.
VAL Sonofabitch sailed right past the turn...
VAL SCREEN, CURSOR travelling...
MICK So where's he going?
VAL He's heading for the Valley.
MICK Fuck, he's going to Maggie's.
MICK Keep track of him.
MICK Hangs up again.
MICK Looks around-- as if looking for an idea-- then, frantic, looks up a number-- can't find it, finds it-- dials-- it rings-- Cold sweat til somebody answers--
MICK (CONT'D) Eddie?
MICK (CONT'D) Eddie Vogel?
MICK (CONT'D) It's Mick Haller...
As the "ROAD SAINTS"-- EDDIE, HARD-CASE, others-- pour out of the bar, jump on their HARLEYS...
ROAR OFF...
inside which the RINGING OF A PHONE brings us BACK TO--
MICK Yes?
VAL'S VOICE Mick, it's me...
VAL Where's Maggie live?
VAL What street?
VAL He's almost there, Mick.
Descending on the valley side...
Harleys pouring it on in formation, like fighter-jets...
She screeches to the curb, hops out...
School bus stop, where other parents wait, in cars, under umbrellas...
Maggie rushes forward, scans for the approaching bus...
Nowhere in sight...
He's holding a phone, squeezing it, LISTENING TO A RING AT THE OTHER END...
To himself, a prayer...
MICK Maggie be there, Maggie pick up...
Stands there, with the SITTER...
SEES the bus approaching...
Her CELL-PHONE left on its dashboard rack, ringing...
Frantic for her to answer...
Hello...
MICK Maggie!
MAGGIE'S VOICE You've reached the cell-phone of Maggie McPherson...
Slams down the phone...
Desperate, grabs his jacket, his gun, flies towards the front door...
OPENS it-- and MARY WINDSOR stands there.
Before he speaks-- She raises her hand and SHOOTS him.
BRIGHT FLASH-- Nick's POV, Woozy-- he falls back, she raises her gun again--
MARY WINDSOR You took my son away from me!
MARY WINDSOR She raises her gun again-- Mick FIRES AT HER FROM INSIDE THE JACKET.
MARY WINDSOR Her body jerks back, she falls...
MARY WINDSOR Mick, stunned, lies there...
MARY WINDSOR He watches, through the haze of his condition, as Mary Windsor's fallen body jerks, on the floor...
MARY WINDSOR CUT TO,
Hate contorting his features, he's checking out the street numbers through the DOWNWARD SLASH OF RAIN...
WHEN...
The ROAD SAINTS, MOTORCYCLES SPANNING THE STREET, ARE HEADING
Off Louis, his confusion and dawning fear...
Cut to,
Out steps Hayley, safe into Maggie's arms.
Sitter looks on as Maggie hugs her...
WHILE...
Where he was shot.
He's alert but still...
Then rouses more as he HEARS feet come up the front steps...
MICK They're down!
MICK I'm shot!
MICK Suddenly LANKFORD & SOBEL are through the door-- Lankford sees Mary on the floor, while--
SOBEL Don't move, Haller-- She rushes to him.
SOBEL Lankford's already on his phone--
LANKFORD This is Lankford, we've got a shooting, twelve-twelve Creek off Laurel, we need paramedics, ambulance transport for two-- During which he's checking Mary Windsor's body, revises--
LANKFORD (CONT'D) Transport for one.
LANKFORD (CONT'D) Rings off.
LANKFORD (CONT'D) Sobel takes Mick's hand, presses it to his wound--
SOBEL Press hard and keep pressing.
SOBEL Mick's hand is on a blood-soaked hole, hurting like hell...
SOBEL while Lankford makes another call...
LANKFORD Yeah, it's Lankford again.
LANKFORD Tell them it's over, they can grab Roulet and bring him in...
LANKFORD He what?
So, bring him to the Emergency Room first, then bring him in!
Dig this.
The uniforms had some help picking up Roulet.
Some motorcycle gang was already beating the shit out of him.
MICK The police were tailing him?
SOBEL We thought he'd come after you.
SOBEL We couldn't tell you.
SOBEL The truth is we had plenty on him for killing Renteria.
SOBEL Jesus Martinez will be released.
SOBEL But we wanted Roulet for Levin, too.
SOBEL I told you: We had to find out how he beat the trace.
SOBEL Now we know.
SOBEL (her glance goes to Mary
It was almost perfect.
He's still wearing the anklet...
MICK I know...
SOBEL And it puts him half a city away.
SOBEL Just like last time.
SOBEL They share a look at the cleverness of it.
SOBEL When--
LANKFORD Look at this.
LANKFORD Mick looks, HIS WOOZY POV AGAIN: Lankford, wearing a glove, lifts Mary's gun.
LANKFORD Pearl-handled: The WOODSMAN.
LANKFORD Admiring--
LANKFORD (CONT'D) They don't make'm like this anymore.
Mick, makes a shape with his free hand.
The "Longhorns" sign: inner fingers pointing down.
Like Raul made.
MICK "W."
MICK Mrs. Windsor.
MICK Which is the last thing he manages to say before blanking.
L.A.'s best weather: Smog-blue.
The tree off Mick's porch.
Hayley's skinny legs climb nimbly from branch to branch.
From the angle, we can tell someone is watching her.
Lifts herself.
Nimble.
And so pretty.
Watching is:
Recovering, but not fully there.
MAGGIE SITS INTO FRAME beside him.
MAGGIE I didn't know you were awake.
MAGGIE He looks at her.
MAGGIE Questioning.
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Don't worry, we haven't been living here.
MAGGIE (CONT'D) We did, for a while.
MAGGIE (CONT'D) When you were touch and go.
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Mick.
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Returns his gaze to-- HAYLEY, going branch to branch.
MAGGIE (CONT'D) I'd better get her down, she can get hurt up there--
MICK You can get hurt anywhere.
MICK Let her climb.
MICK An almost normal tone of voice.
MICK She smiles.
MICK CUT TO,
MICK Keep your speed up, Earl...
MICK He's IN THE BACK-SEAT, IT'S A MESS...
MICK He's scribbling on papers as they ride...
MICK His CELL-PHONE RINGS...
This is Haller.
