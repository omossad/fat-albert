Screenplay

MARIO PUZO and
1 Gulf and Western Plaza March 29, 1971 New York, New York 10019
The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black background.
There is a moment's hesitation, and then the simple words in white lettering:
While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America."
Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great emotion.
BONASERA America has made my fortune.
As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.
BONASERA I raised my daughter in the American fashion; I gave her freedom, but taught her never to dishonor her family.
BONASERA She found a boy friend, not an Italian.
BONASERA She went to the movies with him, stayed out late.
BONASERA Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend.
BONASERA They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her.
BONASERA She resisted; she kept her honor.
BONASERA So they beat her like an animal.
BONASERA When I went to the hospital her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered and held together by wire, and she could not even weep because of the pain.
He can barely speak; he is weeping now.
BONASERA I went to the Police like a good American.
BONASERA These two boys were arrested and brought to trial.
BONASERA The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence.
BONASERA Suspended sentence!
BONASERA They went free that very day.
BONASERA I stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those bastards, they smiled at me.
BONASERA Then I said to my wife, for Justice, we must go to The Godfather.
By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office in his home.
The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with patterned shadows.
We are watching BONASERA over the shoulder of DON CORLEONE.
TOM HAGEN sits near a small table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine.
We can HEAR music, and the laughter and voices of many people outside.
DON CORLEONE Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.
DON CORLEONE I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
BONASERA What do you want of me?
BONASERA I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
DON CORLEONE And what is that Bonasera?
BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.
DON CORLEONE No.
DON CORLEONE You ask for too much.
BONASERA I ask for Justice.
DON CORLEONE The Court gave you justice.
BONASERA An eye for an eye!
DON CORLEONE But your daughter is still alive.
BONASERA Then make them suffer as she suffers.
BONASERA How much shall I pay you.
Both HAGEN and SONNY react.
DON CORLEONE You never think to protect yourself with real friends.
DON CORLEONE You think it's enough to be an American.
DON CORLEONE All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me.
DON CORLEONE But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice.
DON CORLEONE And you don't ask in respect or friendship.
DON CORLEONE And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
BONASERA America has been good to me...
DON CORLEONE Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.
DON CORLEONE But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...
Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.
BONASERA Be my friend.
DON CORLEONE Good.
DON CORLEONE From me you'll get Justice.
BONASERA Godfather.
DON CORLEONE Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.
There are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard and gardens.
There is music and laughing and dancing and countless tables covered with food and wine.
DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of the wedding party.
He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the children, and makes them all welcome.
They in turn carry with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.
The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE, MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.
As they move into the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.
DON CORLEONE Where's Michael?
SONNY He'll be here Pop, it's still early.
DON CORLEONE Then the picture will wait for him.
Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves back to the house.
SONNY gives a delicious smile in the direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.
She returns it.
Then he moves to his wife.
SONNY Sandra, watch the kids.
SONNY They're running wild.
SANDRA You watch yourself.
HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.
TOM crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.
Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits, working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers down in their notebooks.
We HEAR the music and laughter coming from the party in the distance.
A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.
BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.
The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.
Put another number in the notebook.
A shiney new Cadillac with wooden bumpers.
PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping bellies with the ladies.
CLEMENZA Paulie...wine...WINE.
He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.
PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings it to him.
PAULIE You look terrif on the floor!
CLEMENZA What are you, a dance judge?
CLEMENZA Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood...
CLEMENZA see everything is okay.
PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps back into the dance.
The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.
Put another number in the notebook.
TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR- OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his enormous brown shoes.
The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by CLEMENZA and PAULIE.
SONNY Buddy, this is a private party.
The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the sedan.
SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.
The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card, without saying a word.
SONNY steps back, spits on the ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE, and another TWO MEN.
He doesn't say a thing for most of the walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.
SONNY Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.
DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the dark study.
NAZORINE ...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
DON CORLEONE Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
NAZORINE Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.
NAZORINE And you see, Godfather...
NAZORINE He...my daughter...they...
DON CORLEONE You want him to stay in this country.
NAZORINE Godfather, you understand everything.
DON CORLEONE Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
NAZORINE An Act of Congress!
HAGEN It will cost.
The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE nods.
NAZORINE Is that all?
NAZORINE Godfather, thank you...
NAZORINE Oh, wait till you see the cake I made for your beautiful daughter!
NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.
DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.
HAGEN Who do I give this job to?
The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.
DON CORLEONE Not to one of our paisans...give it to a Jew Congressman in another district.
DON CORLEONE Who else is on the list for today?
The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting to see him.
HAGEN Francesco Nippi.
HAGEN His nephew has been refused parole.
HAGEN A bad case.
NIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.
HAGEN His father worked with you in the freight yards when you were young.
LUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.
HAGEN He's not on the list, but Luca Brasi wants to see you.
The DON turns to HAGEN.
DON CORLEONE Is it necessary?
HAGEN You understand him better than anyone.
The DON nods to this.
Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.
MICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain, leads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally stopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.
The DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds, following them.
MICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces her to his GIRL.
The DON's eyes peering through the blinds.
KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding, burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.
She is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and the vitality.
KAY I've never seen anything like it.
MICHAEL I told you I had a lot of relatives.
KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.
We see what she sees:
Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine barrels.
KAY Michael, what are those men doing?
MICHAEL They're waiting to see my father.
KAY They're talking to themselves.
MICHAEL They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
KAY Why do they bother him on a day like this?
MICHAEL Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.
He is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.
She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she holds.
In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt, where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.
CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the things hold.
Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.
CARLO Cut it out, Connie.
The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm, is fat with money.
PAULIE What do you think?
PAULIE Twenty grand?
A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking eyes from the purse.
PAULIE Who knows?
PAULIE Maybe more.
PAULIE Twenty, thirty grand in small bills cash in that silk purse.
PAULIE Holy Toledo, if this was somebody else's wedding!
SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.
Every once in a while he glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with some WOMEN.
He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.
SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.
WOMAN Is it true what they say about your husband, Sandra?
SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.
Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.
SONNY and LUCY are gone.
The empty hallway.
The bathroom door opens and LUCY surreptitiously steps out.
She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing, motioning for her to come up.
She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.
KAY and MICHAEL.
KAY Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a relative?
She has picked out LUCA BRASI.
MICHAEL No.
MICHAEL His name is Luca Brasi.
MICHAEL You wouldn't like him.
KAY Who is he?
MICHAEL You really want to know?
KAY Yes.
KAY Tell me.
MICHAEL You like spaghetti?
KAY You know I love spaghetti.
MICHAEL Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
She starts to eat her spaghetti.
She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.
MICHAEL Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.
MICHAEL They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
KAY Al Capone!
MICHAEL My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.
MICHAEL He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths.
MICHAEL Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
KAY Michael...
MICHAEL Then the legs at the knees...
KAY Michael you're trying to scare me...
MICHAEL Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
KAY Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
MICHAEL Then Luca turned to the other man...
KAY Michael, I love you.
MICHAEL ...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a tall story.
KAY I never know when you're telling me the truth.
MICHAEL I told you you wouldn't like him.
KAY He's coming over here!
LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near their table.
MICHAEL Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
KAY How do you do.
MICHAEL My brother, Tom Hagen.
HAGEN Hello Kay.
HAGEN Your father's inside, doing some business.
HAGEN He's been asking for you.
MICHAEL Thanks Tom.
HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously following.
KAY If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
MICHAEL My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.
MICHAEL He's a good lawyer.
DON CORLEONE at the window.
He has seen the intimacy of the
LUCA Don Corleone...
THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves forward to kiss his hand.
He takes the envelope from his jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes a formal speech.
LUCA Don Corleone...I am honored, and grateful...that you invited me to your home...on the wedding day of your...daughter.
LUCA May their first child...be a masculine child.
LUCA I pledge my never ending loyalty.
LUCA For your daughter's bridal purse.
DON CORLEONE Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend.
THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so tightly we might imagine it to be painful.
LUCA Let me leave you, Don Corleone.
LUCA I know you are busy.
He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with the same formality he entered with.
DON CORLEONE breathes more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.
DON CORLEONE I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
HAGEN The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.
HAGEN Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts.
HAGEN And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
DON CORLEONE is not pleased.
HAGEN The action is narcotics.
HAGEN Sollozzo has contacts in Turkey for the poppy, in Sicily for the plants to process down to morphine or up to heroin.
HAGEN Also he has access to this country.
HAGEN He's coming to us for financial help, and some sort of immunity from the law.
HAGEN For that we get a piece of the action, I couldn't find out how much.
HAGEN Sollozzo is vouched for by the Tattaglia family, and they may have a piece of the action.
HAGEN They call Sollozzo the Turk.
HAGEN He's spent a lot of time in Turkey and is suppose to have a Turkish wife and kids.
HAGEN He's suppose to be very quick with the knife, or was, when he was younger.
HAGEN Only in matters of business and with some reasonable complaint.
HAGEN Also he has an American wife and three children and he is a good family man.
THE DON nods.
HAGEN He's his own boss, and very competent.
DON CORLEONE And with prison record.
HAGEN Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.
HAGEN He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man.
HAGEN That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
DON CORLEONE When did he call?
HAGEN This morning.
DON CORLEONE On a day like this.
DON CORLEONE Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.
DON CORLEONE Write that down before you forget it.
DON CORLEONE The Turk will wait.
We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers from outside.
In Italian, with unmistakable style.
DON CORLEONE What that?
DON CORLEONE It sounds like Johnny.
He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the room with light.
DON CORLEONE It is Johnny.
DON CORLEONE He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
HAGEN Should I bring him in.
DON CORLEONE No.
DON CORLEONE Let the people enjoy him.
DON CORLEONE You see?
DON CORLEONE He is a good godson.
HAGEN It's been two years.
HAGEN He's probably in trouble again.
JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and excitement of the wedding GUESTS.
KAY I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
MICHAEL Sure.
KAY I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
MICHAEL He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.
They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.
DON CORLEONE My Godson has come three thousand miles to do us honor and no one thinks to wet his throat.
At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.
JOHNNY I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.
JOHNNY When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
DON CORLEONE Can I do something for you still?
DON CORLEONE You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
JOHNNY I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
He's very disturbed.
The GODFATHER indicates that he come with him to the office so no one will notice.
He turns to
DON CORLEONE Tell Santino to come in with us.
DON CORLEONE He should hear some things.
They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.
HAGEN glances up the staircase.
HAGEN Sonny?
Then he goes up.
SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing against the door.
Her face peeks out from the layers of petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.
LUCY Sonnyeeeeeeee.
Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his body.
But there is a knocking as well.
They stop, freeze in that position.
HAGEN Sonny?
HAGEN Sonny, you in there?
Outside, HAGEN by the door.
HAGEN The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
SONNY Okay.
SONNY One minute.
HAGEN hesitates.
We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the door again.
TOM leaves.
DON CORLEONE ACT LIKE A MAN!
DON CORLEONE By Christ in Heaven, is it possible you turned out no better than a Hollywood finocchio.
Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.
The DON smiles.
SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still adjusting his clothes.
DON CORLEONE All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
JOHNNY He owns the studio.
JOHNNY Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.
JOHNNY And the main character is a guy just like me.
JOHNNY I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
The DON is silent, stern.
DON CORLEONE You take care of your family?
JOHNNY Sure.
He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as he can.
DON CORLEONE You look terrible.
DON CORLEONE I want you to eat well, to rest.
DON CORLEONE And spend time with your family.
DON CORLEONE And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
JOHNNY It's too late.
JOHNNY All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
DON CORLEONE I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough to hurt.
DON CORLEONE Now go back to the party and leave it to me.
He closes the door, smiling to himself.
Turns to HAGEN.
DON CORLEONE When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
HAGEN They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that.
HAGEN Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
DON CORLEONE No, give him a living.
DON CORLEONE But never let him know the family's business.
DON CORLEONE What else, Tom?
HAGEN I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.
HAGEN He won't last out the night.
This saddens the DON.
He sighs.
DON CORLEONE Genco will wait for me.
DON CORLEONE Santino, tell your brothers they will come with me to the hospital to see Genco.
DON CORLEONE Tell Fredo to drive the big car, and ask Johnny to come with us.
SONNY And Michael?
DON CORLEONE All my sons.
DON CORLEONE Tom, I want you to go to California tonight.
DON CORLEONE Make the arrangements.
DON CORLEONE But don't leave until I come back from the hospital and speak to you.
DON CORLEONE Understood?
HAGEN Understood.
Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument of his gratitude.
The CROWD is favorably impressed: they begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses, in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and kiss the Groom.
Louder and louder, five hundred forks hitting five hundred glasses.
Silence.
HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.
The GUESTS are gone.
A single black car is in the courtyard.
FREDDIE is behind the driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.
DON CORLEONE Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
MICHAEL Tom said he'd take care of it.
The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through the gate of the great Corleone Mall.
A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but all plump and dressed in black.
DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end.
But then the DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder.
MICHAEL stops and turns toward his FATHER.
The two looks at one another for some time.
SILENCE.
DON CORLEONE then lifts his hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's uniform.
DON CORLEONE What was this for?
MICHAEL For bravery.
DON CORLEONE And this?
MICHAEL For killing a man.
DON CORLEONE What miracles you do for strangers.
MICHAEL I fought for my country.
MICHAEL It was my choice.
DON CORLEONE And now, what do you choose to do?
MICHAEL I'm going to finish school.
DON CORLEONE Good.
DON CORLEONE When you are finished, come and talk to me.
DON CORLEONE I have hopes for you.
Again they regard each other without a word.
MICHAEL turns, and continues on.
DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then follows.
DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR VIEW.
He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.
DON CORLEONE Genco, I've brought my sons to pay their respects.
DON CORLEONE And look, even Johnny Fontane, all the way from Hollywood.
GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man.
DON CORLEONE takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.
GENCO Godfather, Godfather, it's your daughter's wedding day, you cannot refuse me.
GENCO Cure me, you have the power.
DON CORLEONE I have no such power...but Genco, don't fear death.
GENCO It's been arranged, then?
DON CORLEONE You blaspheme.
DON CORLEONE Resign yourself.
GENCO You need your old Consigliere.
GENCO Who will replace me?
GENCO Stay with me Godfather.
GENCO Help me meet death.
GENCO If he sees you, he will be frightened and leave me in peace.
GENCO You can say a word, pull a few strings, eh?
GENCO We'll outwit that bastard as we outwitted all those others.
GENCO Godfather, don't betray me.
The DON motions all the others to leave the room.
They do.
He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.
The interior of a non-stop Constellation.
HAGEN is one of the very few passengers on this late flight.
He looks like any young lawyer on a business trip.
He is tired from the difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed during the wedding.
On the seat next to him is an enormous, bulging briefcase.
He closes his eyes.
The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE.
CARLO is in his undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the contents.
CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble bathroom.
She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and tries to get his interest.
DON CORLEONE in his office.
LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.
DON CORLEONE Luca, I am worried about this man Sollozzo.
DON CORLEONE Find out what you can, through the Tattaglias.
DON CORLEONE Let them believe you could be tempted away from the Corleone Family, if the right offer was made.
DON CORLEONE Learn what he has under his fingernails...
The hallway of an apartment building.
SONNY enters, climbs two steps at a time.
He knocks, and then whispers.
SONNY It's me, Sonny.
The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling him into the apartment.
LUCA BRASI's tiny room.
He is partly dressed.
He kneels and reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked trunk.
He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof vest.
He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then puts on his shirt and jacket.
He takes his gun, quickly disassembles, checks, and reassembles it.
And leaves.
A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.
MICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New Hampshire.
LUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty subway train.
HAGEN on the Constellation.
He reaches into his briefcase, and takes out several pictures and papers.
One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a lovely young child star to his immediate right.
HAGEN considers other papers.
DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.
He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.
DON CORLEONE Remember my new Consigliere, a lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns.
JACK WOLTZ ESTATE.
HAGEN stands before the impressive gate, armed only with his briefcase.
A GATEMAN opens the gate, and TOM enters.
HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal gardens, martinis in hand.
WOLTZ You should have told me your boss was Corleone, Tom, I had to check you out.
WOLTZ I thought you were just some third rate hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me.
WOLTZ Florence, thirteenth century.
WOLTZ Decorated the garden of a king.
They cross the garden and head toward the stables.
WOLTZ I'm going to show you something beautiful.
They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM."
TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they rise as WOLTZ approaches.
WOLTZ You like horses?
WOLTZ I like horses, I love 'em.
WOLTZ Beautiful, expensive Racehorses.
The animal inside is truly beautiful.
WOLTZ whispers to him with true love in his voice.
WOLTZ Khartoum...Kartoum...You are looking at six hundred thousand dollars on four hoofs.
WOLTZ I bet even Russian Czars never paid that kind of dough for a single horse.
WOLTZ But I'm not going to race him I'm going to put him out to Stud.
HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table, attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.
Great paintings hang on the walls.
The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.
HAGEN Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.
HAGEN That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
WOLTZ Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.
WOLTZ But he should try me again on anything else.
HAGEN He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first.
HAGEN Understood?
WOLTZ You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.
WOLTZ Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.
WOLTZ I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
HAGEN I'm German-Irish.
WOLTZ Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.
WOLTZ And I'll tell you why.
WOLTZ He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.
WOLTZ For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!
WOLTZ Acting lessons!
WOLTZ Dancing lessons!
WOLTZ We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.
WOLTZ I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.
WOLTZ That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.
WOLTZ Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.
WOLTZ She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.
WOLTZ A MAN IN
An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott Street with a large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS, INC."
next to an open-faced fruit market.
A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters the building.
This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.
Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps before he actually rises into view.
He is a small man, very dark, with curly black hair.
But wiry, and tight and hard, and obviously very dangerous.
He is greeted at the head of the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it, introducing himself.
For a moment, there is a complex of handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful introductions.
Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.
They are very respectful of one another.
Folding chairs are brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE, CLEMENZA and TESSIO.
The DON is the slightest bit foolish with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no one.
Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.
SOLLOZZO My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.
SOLLOZZO My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.
SOLLOZZO The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
DON CORLEONE Why do you come to me?
DON CORLEONE Why do I deserve your generosity?
SOLLOZZO I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.
SOLLOZZO Be my friend.
DON CORLEONE What percentages for my family?
SOLLOZZO Thirty per cent.
SOLLOZZO In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
DON CORLEONE And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.
SOLLOZZO My compliments.
SOLLOZZO I'll take care of them from my share.
DON CORLEONE So.
DON CORLEONE I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.
DON CORLEONE No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
SOLLOZZO If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.
There is a long silence; in which each person present feels the tension.
The DON is about to give his answer.
DON CORLEONE I said I would see you because I've heard you're a serious man, to be treated with respect...
DON CORLEONE But I'll say no to you.
We feel this around the room.
DON CORLEONE I'll give you my reasons.
DON CORLEONE I have many, many friends in Politics.
DON CORLEONE But they wouldn't be so friendly if my business was narcotics instead of gambling.
DON CORLEONE They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice...and they think narcotics is dirty business.
SOLLOZZO takes a breath.
DON CORLEONE No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.
DON CORLEONE But this proposition of yours is too risky.
DON CORLEONE All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
SOLLOZZO Are you worried about security for your million?
DON CORLEONE No.
SOLLOZZO The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
This startles SONNY; he blurts out.
SONNY The Tattaglia family guarantees our investment?
SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face him.
Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out of line.
DON CORLEONE Young people are greedy, and they have no manners.
DON CORLEONE They speak when they should listen.
DON CORLEONE But I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I've spoiled them, as you see.
DON CORLEONE But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final.
SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.
He glances one last time at SONNY.
He rises; all the others do as well.
He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally takes his leave.
When the footsteps can no longer be heard:
The DON turns to SONNY.
DON CORLEONE Santino, never let anyone outside the family know what you are thinking.
DON CORLEONE I think your brain is going soft from all that comedy you play with that young girl.
TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers.
DON CORLEONE What is this nonsense?
HAGEN It's from Johnny.
HAGEN It was announced this morning.
HAGEN He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man, presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.
Soft light bathes the room from the large windows.
We move closer to him until we see his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.
He turns uncomfortably; mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.
Something wet.
He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.
He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.
He is frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on his sheets and pajamas.
He grunts, pulls the puddle of blood in his bed.
He feels his own body frantically, moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of his bed.
Just blood from the hacked neck.
White reedy tendons show.
He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see more clearly.
Froth covers the muzzle, and the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood.
WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.
No sound comes out.
Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.
CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.
Nodding.
DON CORLEONE Send Johnny my congratulations.
Fifth Avenue in the snow.
Christmas week.
People are bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.
KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store, carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.
KAY We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
MICHAEL And what do you want for Christmas?
KAY Just you.
They kiss.
CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music.
THE VIEW PANS AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.
MICHAEL We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony at the City Hall, no big fuss, no family, just a couple of friends as witnesses.
The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on the two single beds that they have pushed together.
KAY What will your father say?
MICHAEL As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.
MICHAEL He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
KAY What time do they expect us?
MICHAEL For dinner.
MICHAEL Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
KAY Michael.
MICHAEL Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
He moves to the telephone.
MICHAEL (CONT'D.) Operator.
MICHAEL (CONT'D.) Get me
KAY Michael, what are you doing?
MICHAEL Shhh, you be the long distance operator.
MICHAEL Here.
KAY Hello...this is Long Distance.
KAY I have a call from New Hampshire.
KAY Mr.
KAY Michael Corleone.
KAY One moment please.
She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.
MICHAEL Hello, Tom?
MICHAEL Michael.
MICHAEL Yeah...
MICHAEL listen, we haven't left yet.
MICHAEL I'm driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow morning.
MICHAEL There's something important I want to tell the old man before Christmas.
MICHAEL Will he be home tomorrow night?
HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office.
In the background, through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in his office.
TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.
HAGEN Sure.
HAGEN Anything I can do for you.
MICHAEL No.
MICHAEL I guess I'll see you Christmas.
MICHAEL Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
HAGEN Right.
He smiles.
MICHAEL has hung up.
He looks at the piles of work, and can't face it.
He rises, puts on his coat and hat, and continues out.
He peeks into the DON's office.
HAGEN Michael called; he's not leaving New Hampshire until tomorrow morning.
HAGEN I've got to go, I promised Theresa I'd pick up some toys for the kids.
The DON smiles and nods.
TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.
FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the afternoon paper.
He puts aside the papers the office manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE, raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the paper.
DON CORLEONE Tell Paulie to get the car from the lot; I'll be ready to go home in a few minutes.
FREDO I'll have to get it myself; Paulie called in sick this morning.
DON CORLEONE That's the third time this month.
DON CORLEONE I think maybe you'd better get a healthier bodyguard for me.
DON CORLEONE Tell Tom.
FREDO Paulie's a good kid.
FREDO If he's sick, he's sick.
FREDO I don't mind getting the car.
FREDDIE leaves.
He slowly puts on his jacket.
Looks out his window.
FREDDIE crosses the street.
OFFICE MANAGER Buon Watale, Don Corleone.
The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat.
Once again, the DON glances out his window.
The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.
DON CORLEONE Merry Christmas.
And he starts down the stairs.
The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail.
When FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the driver's seat.
The DON moves to the car, and is about to get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open fruit stand near the corner.
The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.
The DON walks among the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular piece of fruit.
As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.
The DON pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then turns back to the car.
TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift wrapped.
He continues past the windows.
As he walks, someone walks right in his way.
He looks up.
It is SOLLOZZO.
He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.
SOLLOZZO Don't be frightened.
SOLLOZZO I just want to talk to you.
A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.
SOLLOZZO Get in; I want to talk to you.
HAGEN pulls his arm free.
He is frightened.
HAGEN I haven't got time.
TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.
SOLLOZZO Get in the car.
SOLLOZZO If I wanted to kill you you'd be dead already.
SOLLOZZO Trust me.
HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story of Hansel and Gretel.
We HEAR the car doors shut, and the car drive off.
RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show.
KAY and MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex.
KAY nostalgically hums "The Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk arm in arm.
KAY Would you like me better if I were a nun?
MICHAEL No.
KAY Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
They have passed a little enclosed newsstand.
KAY sees something that terrifies her.
She doesn't know what to do.
MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.
KAY Michael?
MICHAEL I'm thinking about it.
KAY Michael...
MICHAEL No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
She cannot answer him.
Rather she pulls him by the arm, back to the newsstand, and points.
His face goes grave.
The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them.
KAY knows to remain silent.
MICHAEL They don't say if he's dead or alive.
DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the car, when TWO MEN step from the corner.
Suddenly, the DON drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness toward the parked car.
DON CORLEONE Fredo, Fredo!
The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.
Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain, and continues toward the car.
The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking over an entire case of fruit.
The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.
Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.
There are more GUNSHOTS.
FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car; having difficulty opening the door.
He rushes out, a gun trembling in his hand; his mouth open.
He actually drops the gun.
The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.
The GUNMEN are panicked.
They fire once more at the downed DON CORLEONE.
His leg and arm twitch where they are hit; and pools of blood are beginning to form.
The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion; they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.
The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared: rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from windows.
But the street itself is now empty.
FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and face down in them.
FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying something we cannot understand.
He begins to weep profusely.
LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night.
He gets off.
He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.
LUCA walks down the late night street.
He approaches an elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still winking this late at night.
He waits and watches.
Then the sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.
The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless glistening wooden floors.
Now, at this late time, the chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR is waxing them.
A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her receipts.
LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at the bar.
ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves behind the bar.
MAN Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
LUCA I know.
LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.
SOLLOZZO Do you know who I am?
LUCA Nods.
SOLLOZZO You've been talking to the Tattaglias.
SOLLOZZO They thought we could do business.
LUCA listens.
SOLLOZZO I need somebody strong to protect my operation, physically.
SOLLOZZO I've heard you're not happy with your family, you might make a switch.
LUCA If the money is good enough.
SOLLOZZO On the first shipment, I can guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.
LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.
SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it, rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.
BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette.
Then, he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.
The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing.
He approaches it, obviously fresh from a nap.
SONNY Yeah.
VOICE Do you recognize my voice?
SONNY I think so.
SONNY Detective squad?
VOICE Right.
VOICE Don't say my name, just listen.
VOICE Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
SONNY Is he alive?
VOICE I think so, but I can't get close enough.
VOICE There's a lot of blood.
VOICE I'll try to find out more.
SONNY Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming.
SONNY cradles the phone.
An incredible rage builds up in him, his face actually turning red.
He would like to rip the phone to pieces in his bare hands.
Then he controls it.
Quickly, he dials another number.
SONNY Theresa, let me talk to Tom.
SONNY Not yet?
SONNY Have him call me as soon as he gets home.
He hangs up.
SANDRA Sonny?
SANDRA Sonny, who is it?
SANDRA What is it?
SONNY They shot the old man.
SANDRA Oh God...
SONNY Honey...don't worry.
SONNY Nothing else is going to happen.
There is a POUNDING on the door.
A BABY starts crying.
SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and moves quickly.
He opens the front door quickly.
It is CLEMENZA.
He enters, SONNY closes the door.
SANDRA goes to look after the baby.
CLEMENZA You heard about your father?
SONNY Yeah.
CLEMENZA The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
SONNY Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
CLEMENZA Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
SONNY How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
CLEMENZA Maybe three, four times.
CLEMENZA I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.
CLEMENZA Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
SONNY Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.
SONNY Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
CLEMENZA That's all?
CLEMENZA Don't you want me to send some people over here?
SONNY No, just you and Paulie.
CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.
SONNY A couple of our people will come to stay here.
SONNY Do whatever they say; I'm going over to the main house.
SONNY If you want me, use Pop's special phone.
The telephone rings again.
SONNY answers it.
SONNY Hello.
SOLLOZZO Santino Corleone?
SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is.
SONNY indicates that she be quiet.
SONNY Yeah.
SOLLOZZO We have Tom Hagen.
SOLLOZZO In about three hours he'll be released with our proposition.
SOLLOZZO Don't do anything until you've heard what he has to say.
SOLLOZZO You can only cause a lot of trouble.
SOLLOZZO What's done is done.
SOLLOZZO Don't lose that famous temper of yours.
SONNY I'll wait.
FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL.
It is night, but the courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the tops of all the houses.
It is very cold.
We see the figure of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.
SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house.
Then he calls out.
SONNY Ma?
SONNY Ma, where are you.
The kitchen door swings open.
He moves quickly and takes her by the arm.
He is deliberately calm.
SONNY Ma, I just got a call.
SONNY Pop's hurt...I don't know how bad.
MAMA Santino?
MAMA Have they killed him?
SONNY We don't know yet, Ma.
MAMA I'll get dressed.
MAMA In case we can see him...
She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs.
SONNY turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying.
He takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil, and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his father's office.
He switches the lights on in the DON's office.
The massive desk dominates the room.
SONNY moves quickly to the telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk, and dials a number.
SONNY Tessio...This is Santino Corleone.
SONNY I want fifty reliable men out here.
TESSIO I heard, Sonny...but what about Clemenza's regime?
SONNY I don't want to use Clemenza's people right now.
SONNY Understood?
He hangs up.
He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the dial, and removes a small notebook.
He takes it back to the desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.
We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA BRASI.
SONNY dials the number.
There is no answer.
SONNY Luca.
The interior of an abandoned building.
SEVERAL MEN in suits and ties sit around in the booths.
HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.
SOLLOZZO I know you're not in the muscle end of the family--so I don't want you to be afraid.
SOLLOZZO I want you to help the Corleones and I want you to help me.
HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette in his mouth.
ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered china cup.
HAGEN sips gratefully.
SOLLOZZO Your boss is dead...
HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.
SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.
SOLLOZZO Have some more.
SOLLOZZO We got him outside his office, just before I picked you up.
SOLLOZZO You have to make the peace between me and Santino.
HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.
SOLLOZZO Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
SOLLOZZO You know it's the smart thing to do, too.
SOLLOZZO I want you to talk Sonny into it.
HAGEN Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.
SOLLOZZO That's going to be his first reaction.
SOLLOZZO You have to talk some sense into him.
SOLLOZZO The Tattaglia family stands behind me with all their people.
SOLLOZZO The other New York Families will go along with anything that prevents a full scale war.
He leans close to HAGEN.
SOLLOZZO The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.
SOLLOZZO Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.
SOLLOZZO Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
HAGEN Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
SOLLOZZO I'll worry about Luca.
SOLLOZZO You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
HAGEN I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
SOLLOZZO Good...then you can go...
SOLLOZZO I don't like violence.
SOLLOZZO I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
He opens the door; they step out together.
HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.
But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.
He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to SOLLOZZO in private.
Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression.
He opens the door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.
SOLLOZZO The old man is still alive.
SOLLOZZO Five bullets in his Sicilian hide and he's still alive.
SOLLOZZO Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.
MICHAEL driving during the night.
There is a little fog in the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making it difficult to see well.
The wipers move across the view, as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still decorated for Christmas.
The courtyard is bathed with white floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look.
The narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link chain.
There are strange cars parked along the curving cement walk.
SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.
MAN Who're you?
ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and then turns.
MAN 2 It's the Don's kid; take the car, I'll bring him inside.
The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.
The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL doesn't recognize.
They pay little attention to him.
Most of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.
MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.
THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water glass half filled with whiskey.
On the other side of the sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black with his saliva.
PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the other side of the room.
CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at him.
CLEMENZA Your mother's at the hospital with the old man: He's gonna pull through.
MICHAEL nods his relief.
MICHAEL Thanks.
He moves to THERESA.
MICHAEL You heard from Tom yet?
Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and trembles.
Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the room; everyone speaks in a whisper.
MICHAEL C'mon.
He leads her into his father's office without knocking.
SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad.
They look up, startled.
SONNY Don't worry, Theresa; they just want to give Tom the proposition, then they're going to turn him loose.
He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise, he kisses him on the cheek.
SONNY I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
MICHAEL How's Mom?
SONNY Good.
SONNY She's been through it before.
SONNY Me too.
SONNY You were too young to know about it.
SONNY You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
MICHAEL I can help you out...
SONNY Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
MICHAEL Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
SONNY Theresa.
She understands, and leaves them alone.
SONNY All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
MICHAEL What?
SONNY One of them fingered the old man.
MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on trial for their lives.
MICHAEL Clemenza?
MICHAEL No, I don't believe it.
SONNY You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.
SONNY It was Paulie.
MICHAEL How can you be sure?
SONNY On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.
SONNY We got people in the phone company.
SONNY Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the situation.
MICHAEL Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
SONNY Until the old man tells me different.
MICHAEL Then wait, Sonny.
MICHAEL Talk to Pop.
SONNY Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.
SONNY I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.
SONNY The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.
SONNY I don't care if we all go down together.
MICHAEL That's not how Pop would have played it.
SONNY I know I'm not the man he was.
SONNY But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.
SONNY When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
MICHAEL All right, Sonny.
MICHAEL All right.
SONNY Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
MICHAEL Is it like they say?
MICHAEL Is he that good?
Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.
Then open the door and rush out.
Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped in a tight embrace with his WIFE.
HAGEN If I plead before the Supreme Court, I'll never do better than I did tonight with that Turk.
The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's study.
It stands out against the cold, dark night.
The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on the edge of the sofa.
The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.
SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted, in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep.
It is four in the morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many snacks.
They can barely talk anymore.
HAGEN Is the hospital covered?
SONNY The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.
SONNY What about the hit list.
HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.
HAGEN Too much, too far, too personal.
HAGEN The Don would consider this all purely a business dispute: Get rid of Sollozzo, and everything falls in line.
HAGEN YOU don't have to go after the Tattaglias.
CLEMENZA nods.
HAGEN What about Luca?
HAGEN Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.
HAGEN That worries me.
SONNY If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
HAGEN Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
SONNY No, and I've been calling all night.
SONNY Maybe he's shacked up.
HAGEN Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
HAGEN He always goes home when he's through.
HAGEN Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.
MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the number once again.
He can hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answers.
Then hangs up.
HAGEN Keep trying every fifteen minutes.
SONNY Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
HAGEN Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.
HAGEN Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.
HAGEN The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.
HAGEN If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
SONNY That's easy to say; it's not your father.
HAGEN I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
SONNY Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
HAGEN We're all tired...
SONNY OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.
SONNY But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall.
SONNY You too, Mike, no chances.
SONNY Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.
SONNY The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
There is a timid knock on the door.
SONNY What is it?
PAULIE GATTO looks in.
CLEMENZA I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
PAULIE The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
SONNY Tessio, see what it is.
TESSIO gets up, leaves.
PAULIE You want me to hang around?
SONNY Yeah.
SONNY Hang around.
PAULIE Outside?
CLEMENZA Outside.
PAULIE Sure.
He closes the door.
SONNY Clemenza.
SONNY You take care of Paulie.
SONNY I don't ever want to see him again.
SONNY Understood?
CLEMENZA Understood.
SONNY Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.
SONNY Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.
SONNY That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
HAGEN Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.
HAGEN You know the old man doesn't want that.
SONNY OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected.
He dials Luca Brasi's number once again.
The ring repeats, but no one answers.
TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest in his hand.
He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped inside.
CLEMENZA A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.
LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we remember him.
BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.
LUCA looks up at him.
Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.
LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both clamp down as hard as they can.
Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.
His face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a far more extreme way than a normal tongue could.
His eyes bulge.
ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's strength leaves him.
BRUNO Oh Christ...all over the floor.
SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his face.
LUCA falls to the floor.
SOLLOZZO The Godfather is next.
Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb.
There are rows of pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block.
A dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell.
This is ROCCO LAMPONE.
The woman of the house, MRS.
CLEMENZA, talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the side of the house.
ROCCO moves to the garage, which is specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work washing a shiny brand new Lincoln.
LAMPONE admires the car.
LAMPONE Nice.
CLEMENZA Crazy Detroit delivered it with a wooden bumper.
CLEMENZA They're going to send me the chrome bumpers in a couple months.
CLEMENZA I waited two years for this car to come with wooden bumpers!
He scrubs and polishes with great affection.
CLEMENZA Today you make your bones on Paulie.
CLEMENZA You understand everything?
LAMPONE Sure.
As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it, unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.
CLEMENZA .22 soft-nosed load.
CLEMENZA Accurate up to five feet.
LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away.
GATTO's car pulls into the driveway, and he sounds the horn.
The two men walk to the car.
GATTO is driving, a bit nervous, like he doesn't know what is up.
LAMPONE gets in the rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of recognition.
He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting to chide PAULIE for being late.
PAULIE flinches a little when he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:
PAULIE Rocco, sit on the other side.
PAULIE A big guy like you blocks my rearview mirror.
CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.
CLEMENZA Goddamn Sonny.
CLEMENZA He's running scared.
CLEMENZA He's already thinking of going to the mattresses.
CLEMENZA We have to find a place on the West Side.
CLEMENZA Paulie, you know a good location?
PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook he was on.
Also there's the money he can make by selling Sollozzo any secret location.
PAULIE I'll think about it.
CLEMENZA Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
The car pulls out.
Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump.
OUR VIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.
The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter light.
Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.
He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of him.
CLEMENZA Pay attention!
The car is parked in the City.
PAULIE comes down from an available apartment and gets back into the car.
PAULIE Good for ten men...
CLEMENZA OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
The car pulls off.
New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.
CLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.
CLEMENZA You wait; I'll call.
He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.
CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.
The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some bread--and then a plate of veal on his table.
He eats.
CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants; he is well fed.
We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to expect has happened to Paulie.
There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel, LAMPONE in the rear seat.
CLEMENZA steps in.
CLEMENZA He talked my ear off.
CLEMENZA Want us to go back to Long Beach; have another job for us.
CLEMENZA Rocco, you live in the City, can we drop you off?
LAMPONE Ah, I left my car at your place.
CLEMENZA OK, then you gotta come back.
The car pulls out.
By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and secure.
PAULIE You think we'll go for that last place?
CLEMENZA Maybe, or you gotta know now.
PAULIE Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.
Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.
CLEMENZA Paulie, pull over.
CLEMENZA I gotta take a leak.
The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.
CLEMENZA steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.
He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting the ground.
We wait on this for a moment; and then there are two GUNSHOTS.
CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and turns, moving back to the car.
PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind him are shattered.
CLEMENZA Leave the gun.
LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few feet where there is another car.
They get in, and drive off.
HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.
It is late afternoon.
Many strange cars are parked on the nearby streets.
We can see the group of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries with concealed weapons.
MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.
He is bundled in a warm marine coat.
He looks at the strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.
They look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the respect of his position.
He is like an exile Prince.
He wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.
A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground equipment.
The basketball ring now half coming off.
This is where he was a child.
Then a shout.
CLEMENZA Mike.
CLEMENZA Hey Mikey; telephone.
CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.
MICHAEL hurries into the house.
CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.
He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the hook.
CLEMENZA Some dame.
MICHAEL picks it up.
MICHAEL Hello.
MICHAEL Kay?
KAY How is your father?
MICHAEL He'll be OK.
KAY I love you.
He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen.
Tries to shield the phone.
MICHAEL Yeah Kay, I'm here.
KAY Can you say it?
MICHAEL Huh?
KAY Tell me you love me.
MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table.
He curls up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:
MICHAEL I can't...
KAY Please say it.
MICHAEL Look.
MICHAEL I'll see you tonight, OK?
CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all the button men stationed around the house.
CLEMENZA How come you don't tell that nice girl you love her...here, learn something...
CLEMENZA you may have to feed fifty guys some day.
CLEMENZA You start with olive oil...fry some garlic, see.
CLEMENZA And then fry some sausage...or meat balls if you like...then you throw in the tomatoes, the tomato paste...some basil; and a little red wine...that's my trick.
SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.
SONNY You take care of Paulie?
CLEMENZA You won't see Paulie anymore.
CLEMENZA He's sick for good this winter.
MICHAEL starts to leave.
SONNY Where are you going?
MICHAEL To the city.
SONNY Send some bodyguards.
MICHAEL I don't need them, Sonny.
MICHAEL I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital.
MICHAEL Also, I got other things.
CLEMENZA Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
SONNY OK, but be careful.
MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven into the city.
THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front seat.
MICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying to book rooms.
MICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel.
He is preoccupied, she's concerned.
MICHAEL Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.
MICHAEL I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
KAY Can I go to the hospital with you?
MICHAEL I don't think so.
MICHAEL You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
KAY My parents don't read the Daily News.
KAY All right, if you think I shouldn't.
KAY I can't believe the things the papers are printing.
KAY I'm sure most of it's not true.
MICHAEL I don't think so either.
MICHAEL I better go.
KAY When will I see you again?
MICHAEL I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
He leans over her; kisses her.
KAY When will I see you again?
MICHAEL Goodbye.
Quietly, he moves out the door.
KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:
KAY Goodbye.
A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with a neon sign "HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."
MICHAEL steps out, pays the fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.
MICHAEL looks.
He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted.
He is the only one on the street.
There are gay, twinkling Christmas decorations all over the building.
He walks, slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps.
He hesitates, looks around.
This area is empty.
He checks the address on a scrap of paper.
It is correct.
He tries the door, it is empty.
He walks in.
MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital lobby.
He looks to the right; there is a long, empty corridor.
To the left: the same.
HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated building lit by eerie green neon lighting.
All we hear are his sole footsteps.
He walks up to a desk marked "INFORMATION".
No one is there.
He moves quickly to a door marked "OFFICE"; swings into it; no one is there.
He looks onto the desk: There is half a sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.
MICHAEL Hello?
MICHAEL Hello?
Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly, alertly.
MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all alone.
The floors have just been mopped.
They are still wet.
Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several flights.
He steps out onto the fourth floor.
He looks.
There are merely empty corridors.
He takes out his scrap of paper; checks it.
"Room 4A."
Now he hurries, trying to follow the code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker and quicker they flash by him.
Now he stops, looks up "4A-- Corleone".
There is a special card table set up there with some magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.
Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he will find.
He looks.
Lit by the moonlight through the window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the room, and under a transparent oxygen tent.
All that can be heard is the steady though strained breathing.
Slowly MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER, securely asleep.
Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the bed, and run to his nose and mouth.
VOICE What are you doing here?
This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around.
It is a NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.
NURSE You're not supposed to be here now.
MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.
MICHAEL I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.
MICHAEL What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
NURSE Oh your father just had too many visitors.
NURSE It interfered with the hospital service.
NURSE The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.
NURSE But don't worry.
NURSE I look in on him.
MICHAEL You just stand here one minute...
Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.
MICHAEL Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.
MICHAEL I came down late.
MICHAEL There's no one here.
MICHAEL None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.
MICHAEL The old man is completely unprotected.
SONNY All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside.
SONNY I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.
SONNY Sit tight, and don't panic.
MICHAEL I won't panic.
He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...
NURSE You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
MICHAEL You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
NURSE Absolutely not!
NURSE We have to get permission from the Doctor.
MICHAEL You've read about my father in the papers.
MICHAEL You've seen that no one's here to guard him.
MICHAEL Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.
MICHAEL Believe me and help me.
NURSE We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed.
She does so...and they perform the very difficult task of moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.
They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently down the corridor.
We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.
MICHAEL hears them, stops.
MICHAEL Hurry, into there.
They push it into the first available room.
MICHAEL peeks out from the door.
The footsteps are louder; then they emerge.
It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet of flowers.
MICHAEL Who is it?
ENZO Michael...do you remember me, Enzo, the baker's helper to Nazorine, now his son-in-law.
MICHAEL Enzo, get out of here.
MICHAEL There's going to be trouble.
A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.
ENZO If there...will be trouble...I stay with you, to help.
ENZO I owe it to the Godfather.
MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.
MICHAEL Go outside; stand in front...I'll be out in a minute.
They part.
MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they put his FATHER.
NURSE He's awake.
MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he cannot speak.
MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.
MICHAEL Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.
MICHAEL Shhhh, don't try to speak.
MICHAEL There are men who are coming to try to kill you.
MICHAEL But I'm with you...I'm with you now...
The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot.
MICHAEL tenderly puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.
Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO, pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only weapon.
MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.
They both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.
They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette, lights it.
ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.
MICHAEL Get rid of those and look like you've got a gun in your pocket.
The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas decorations.
MICHAEL Listen...
We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.
MICHAEL and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.
Then MICHAEL takes the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.
They stand, hands in their pockets.
A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.
MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.
The car seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.
MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.
MICHAEL looks down; the BAKER's hands are shaking.
He looks at his own, and they are not.
Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of police sirens.
They are clearly coming toward the hospital, getting louder and louder.
MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.
In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed POLICE and DETECTIVES.
He smiles his relief and starts toward them.
TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his arms while ANOTHER frisks him.
A massive POLICE CAPTAIN, spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat, with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.
This is McCLUSKEY.
MCCLUSKEY I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up.
MCCLUSKEY Who the hell are you and what are you doing here?
ANOTHER COP standing nearby:
COP He's clean, Captain.
MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.
MICHAEL What happened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding my father?
MCCLUSKEY You punk-hood.
MCCLUSKEY Who the hell are you to tell me my business.
MCCLUSKEY I pulled them off.
MCCLUSKEY I don't care how many Dago gangsters kill each other.
MCCLUSKEY I wouldn't lift a finger to keep your old man from getting knocked off.
MCCLUSKEY Now get the hell out of here; get off this street you punk, and stay away from this hospital.
MICHAEL stands quiet.
MICHAEL I'll stay until you put guards around my father's room.
MCCLUSKEY Phil, lock this punk up.
A DETECTIVE The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a war hero, and he's never been mixed up in the rackets...
MCCLUSKEY Goddam it, I said lock him up.
MCCLUSKEY Put the cuffs on him.
MICHAEL How much is the Turk paying you to set my father up, Captain?
Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.
MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.
He looks at McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S MEN arrive.
HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.
The gateway now has a long black car blocking it.
There are more BUTTON MEN stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN standing by open windows.
It is clear that the war is escalating.
A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE, MICHAEL and HAGEN.
MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.
He stops and looks up at the open window.
We can see MEN holding rifles.
MICHAEL Christ, Sonny really means business.
They continue walking.
TESSIO joins them.
The various BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.
CLEMENZA How come all the new men?
TESSIO We'll need them now.
TESSIO After the hospital incident, Sonny got mad.
TESSIO We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock this morning.
They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.
SONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.
SONNY I've got a hundred button men on the streets twenty-four hours a day.
SONNY If Sollozzo shows one hair on his ass he's dead.
He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand, kiddingly.
SONNY Mikey, you look beautiful!
MICHAEL Cut it out.
SONNY The Turk wants to talk!
SONNY The nerve of that son of a bitch!
SONNY After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
HAGEN Was there a definite proposal?
SONNY Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition.
SONNY The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
HAGEN What about that Tattaglias?
HAGEN What will they do about Bruno?
SONNY Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
HAGEN We should hear what they have to say.
SONNY No, no Consiglere.
SONNY Not this time.
SONNY No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.
SONNY Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.
SONNY If not, it's all out war.
SONNY We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
HAGEN The other families won't sit still for all out war.
SONNY Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
HAGEN Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.
HAGEN This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
SONNY And when they shot me father...
HAGEN Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
SONNY No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.
SONNY You just help me win.
SONNY Understood?
HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.
HAGEN I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.
HAGEN He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money.
HAGEN McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.
HAGEN What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.
HAGEN Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.
HAGEN Never.
HAGEN It would be disastrous.
HAGEN All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.
HAGEN So just...take that into consideration.
SONNY McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.
SONNY We'll wait.
MICHAEL We can't wait.
MICHAEL No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.
MICHAEL You have to get Sollozzo now.
SONNY The kid's right.
HAGEN What about McCluskey?
MICHAEL Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.
MICHAEL We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
SONNY Go on Mike.
MICHAEL They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.
MICHAEL Set up the meeting for two days from now.
MICHAEL Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held.
Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.
So I'll feel safe.
They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.
Then I'll kill them both.
Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.
Silence.
SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.
He points a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.
SONNY You?
SONNY You, the high-class college kid.
SONNY You never wanted to get mixed up in the family business.
SONNY Now you wanta gun down a police Captain and the Turk just because you got slapped in the face.
SONNY You're taking it personal, it's just business and he's taking it personal.
Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps his face serious.
MICHAEL Sonny, it's all personal, and I learned it from him, the old man, the Godfather.
MICHAEL He took my joining the Marines personal.
MICHAEL I take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal, and you know I'll kill them Sonny.
MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.
CLOSE on a revolver.
CLEMENZA It's as cold as they come, impossible to trace.
CLEMENZA Don't worry about prints Mike, I put a special tape on the trigger and butt.
CLEMENZA Here.
CLEMENZA Whatsamatter?
CLEMENZA Trigger too tight.
CLEMENZA I left it noisy, so it'll scare any pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander away.
MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.
CLEMENZA Just let your hand drop to your side, and let the gun slip out.
CLEMENZA Everybody will still think you got it.
CLEMENZA They'll be starin' at your face, see?
CLEMENZA Then walk out of the place real fast, but don't run.
CLEMENZA Don't look anybody directly in the eye, but don't look away from them neither.
CLEMENZA Hey, they'll be scared stiff o you, believe me.
CLEMENZA Nobody's gonna bother with you.
CLEMENZA Don't worry about nothing; you'd be surprised how good these things go.
CLEMENZA O.K., put your hat on, let's see how you look.
CLEMENZA Helps with identification.
They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.
CLEMENZA Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.
CLEMENZA Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
MICHAEL How bad will it be?
CLEMENZA Probably all the other families will line up against us.
CLEMENZA But, it's alright.
CLEMENZA These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood.
CLEMENZA You gotta stop 'em at the beginning.
CLEMENZA Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
MICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house.
A card table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the Corleone buttonmen.
He continues into the living room.
It's a mess.
SONNY asleep on the sofa.
On the coffee table are the remains of a take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of whisky.
The radio is playing.
MICHAEL Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
SONNY What are you, inspecting the barracks?
SONNY You ready?
SONNY Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
MICHAEL A million times.
SONNY Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
HAGEN We don't let Mike go until we have the hostage, Sonny.
CLEMENZA It's okay...the hostage is outside playing pinochle with three of my men.
The phone rings in the DON's office.
SONNY That could be a Tattaglia informer with the meeting place.
HAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS move in.
HAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.
SONNY One of Tattaglia's people?
HAGEN No.
HAGEN Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.
HAGEN Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.
HAGEN Anyone know it.
TESSIO Sure, I do.
TESSIO It's perfect for us.
TESSIO A small family place with big booths where people can talk in private.
TESSIO Good food.
TESSIO Everybody minds their business.
TESSIO Perfect.
TESSIO This is the entrance, Mike.
TESSIO When you finish just walk out and turn left, then turn the corner.
TESSIO Clemenza, you gotta work fast to plant the gun.
TESSIO They got an old- fashioned toilet with a space between the water container and the wall.
TESSIO We can tape the gun behind there.
CLEMENZA Mike, they're gonna frisk you in the car.
CLEMENZA You'll be clean so they won't worry 'bout nothing.
CLEMENZA In the restaurant, wait and talk a while, and then ask permission to go.
CLEMENZA See?
CLEMENZA Then when you come out, don't waste time; don't sit down...you come out blasting.
CLEMENZA And don't take chances.
CLEMENZA In the head, two shots apiece.
CLEMENZA And out as fast as your legs can move.
SONNY I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.
SONNY I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
CLEMENZA The gun will be there.
SONNY You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.
SONNY And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
CLEMENZA We gotta move...
MICHAEL O.K.
MICHAEL How long do you think before I can come back?
SONNY Probably a year...
HAGEN Jesus, I don't know...
SONNY Can you do it Mike?
MICHAEL moves out.
The enormous "CAMELS" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat CLEMENZA had given him.
A long black car pulls around the corner and slows before him.
The DRIVER, leaning over, open the front door.
DRIVER Get in, Mike.
He does, the car drives off.
Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat and shakes MIKE's hand.
SOLLOZZO I'm glad you came, Mike.
SOLLOZZO I hope we can straighten everything out.
SOLLOZZO All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all.
SOLLOZZO It should never have happened.
MICHAEL I want to settle things tonight.
MICHAEL I want my father left alone.
SOLLOZZO He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.
SOLLOZZO Just keep an open mind when we talk.
SOLLOZZO I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.
SOLLOZZO It's impossible to talk business with him.
McCLUSKEY grunts.
MCCLUSKEY He's a good kid.
MCCLUSKEY He's all right.
MCCLUSKEY Turn around, up on your knees, facing me.
He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.
MCCLUSKEY I'm sorry about the other night Mike.
MCCLUSKEY I'm getting too old for my job, too grouchy.
MCCLUSKEY Can't stand the aggravation.
MCCLUSKEY You know how it is.
MCCLUSKEY He's clean.
MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where they're heading.
The car takes the George Washington Bridge.
MICHAEL is concerned.
MICHAEL We're going to New Jersey?
SOLLOZZO Maybe.
MICHAEL closes his eyes.
The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way to New Jersey.
Then suddenly it hits the divider, temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the lanes going back to New York.
It then hits it very fast, on the way back to the city.
SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and then leans to the DRIVER.
SOLLOZZO Nice work; I'll remember it.
MICHAEL is relieved.
The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in the Bronx: The "LUNA AZURA".
There is no one on the street.
MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with them.
He gets out, and opens the door.
SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the car.
They enter the restaurant.
A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.
SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small round table near the center of the room.
There are empty booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS, and ONE or TWO WAITERS.
It is very quiet.
MCCLUSKEY Is the Italian food good here?
SOLLOZZO Try the veal; it's the finest in New York.
The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.
They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three glasses.
Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:
SOLLOZZO I am going to talk Italian to Mike.
MCCLUSKEY Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll concentrate on my veal and my spaghetti.
SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.
MICHAEL listening carefully and nodding every so often.
Then MICHAEL answers in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.
The WAITER occasionally brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.
Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in Italian, accidentally lapses into English.
MICHAEL Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
SOLLOZZO What guarantees can I give you?
SOLLOZZO I am the hunted one.
SOLLOZZO I've missed my chance.
SOLLOZZO You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling holding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up my sleeve".
Then he looks away and makes a distressed look on his face.
SOLLOZZO What is it?
MICHAEL Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.
He studies MICHAEL with his dark eyes.
Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.
MCCLUSKEY I frisked him; I've frisked thousands of young punks; he's clean.
He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them; indicating the bathroom with his eyes.
The MAN nods, indicating no one is there.
SOLLOZZO Don't take too long.
MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and disappears inside.
MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very hard.
He actually uses the urinal.
Then he washes his hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.
Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.
Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he cannot feel the gun.
We see behind the tank his hand is just a few inches from the gun...he gropes searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.
CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.
Then he breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep breath and shoves it under his waistband.
For some unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately washes his hands and dries them.
Then he goes out.
He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.
McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.
SOLLOZZO turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at MICHAEL.
MICHAEL looks back.
Then he smiles and continues back to the table.
He sits down.
MICHAEL Now I can talk.
MICHAEL I feel much better.
The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now he too relaxes.
SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton his jacket.
SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear him.
The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his temple.
He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the entire area.
The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is sprayed and stained with blood.
SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he seems to hang in space suspended.
MICHAEL pivots, and looks:
There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal suspended in air before his gaping mouth.
MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging throat.
He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.
Then coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.
The air is filled with pink mist.
MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.
He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.
Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.
The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an expression of horror on his face.
MICHAEL looks at his two victims: SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by the table.
McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.
MICHAEL is wildly at a peak.
He starts to move out.
His hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.
He moves, not letting the gun go.
MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.
His hand: still holding the gun.
His face: finally he closes his eyes.
His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.
He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.
He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had been recreated in wax.
Then he leaves.
A MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.
ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.
A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table, quietly eating.
They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there is an occasional laugh.
ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.
A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.
The sentimental tune is continued over the following:
A MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie still together in a bullet-riddled automobile.
A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.
Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty living room of an apartment.
THREE or FOUR MEN including CLEMENZA, are taking naps.
An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.
The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and pouring the wine.
Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.
A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.
Truman.
ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning three steps of a front stoop.
TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a crossword puzzle.
A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.
Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.
Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.
A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.
A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet alley.
A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in a pool of blood on the tablecloth.
A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an apartment.
We catch a glimpse of one headline: "Five Family War..."
The table.
The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.
ONE has fallen asleep on his arms at the table.
SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.
The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse.
Picks up and takes a drag from his cigarette.
The OTHER MAN nods appreciatively.
MAN Nice Augie...nice.
Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York apartment building.
We recognize a couple of SONNY's bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards against the curb.
Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.
Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step, smoking a cigarette.
One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch, which is attached to a key chain.
We HEAR the sound of a door opening; they look up.
The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.
SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI wrapped around him.
She doesn't want to let go of him; she draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.
He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.
The men quickly take up their positions.
As he gets in his car:
DRIVER Pick up your sister?
SONNY Yeah.
The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards in their cars.
He knocks on the door.
No answer.
Then again.
CONNIE'S VOICE Who is it?
SONNY It's me, Sonny.
We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.
SONNY enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her back to him.
SONNY Connie, what is it?
He turns her around in his arms.
Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.
As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red with rage.
She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing him from running out of the apartment.
CONNIE It was my fault!
CONNIE I started a fight with him and I tried to hit him so he hit me.
CONNIE He didn't even try to hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.
Sonny listens, and calms himself.
He touches her shoulder, the thin silk robe.
SONNY I'm goin' to have the doctor come over and take a look at you.
He starts to leave.
CONNIE Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.
CONNIE Please don't.
He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.
SONNY Hey.
SONNY Con.
SONNY What'm I goin' to do?
SONNY Make your kid a orphan before he's born.
She laughs with him.
He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.
CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.
"Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the corner.
The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the kids on the street are still playing stickball.
CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block and to a halt in front of the candy store.
The tires scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast the everyone is paralyzed.
It is a moment before we recognize that it is SONNY.
His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on the stoop and has CARLO by the throat.
He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down into the street.
But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing, and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.
His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.
SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.
SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength, in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.
His blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.
The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching in fascination.
CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.
SONNY beats him mercilessly.
Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become spectators.
SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into CARLO's face and body.
CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does nothing, other than hang onto the railing.
SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in the effort.
Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands; even biting them.
CARLO screams but he does not let go.
It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will not be moved.
SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him more; but he is exhausted.
Totally out of breath, he stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.
SONNY You...bastard...You...hurt my sister...
SONNY again...and I'll kill...you.
He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.
and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone, leaving even his bodyguards in confusion.
We notice ONE MAN with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially interested.
CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.
He slumps onto the stoop.
HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall.
It is a gray, rainy day.
Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of various points around the main house and compound.
Things have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new and secure gate house has been built.
Security measures that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval Fortress.
We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the result of a recent bomb attempt.
The house nearest the crater is damaged by fire.
A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the shelter of the gate house.
They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they call the main house.
KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still runs down onto her face.
She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.
TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.
HAGEN Kay, we weren't expecting you.
HAGEN You should call...
KAY I've tried calling and writing.
KAY I want to reach Michael.
HAGEN Nobody knows where he is.
HAGEN We know he's all right, but that's all.
KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with rainwater.
KAY What was that?
HAGEN An accident.
HAGEN No one was hurt.
KAY Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has to.
HAGEN Sure...I'm sorry.
They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.
In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and takes her rainhat off.
KAY Will you give this to him.
HAGEN If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts.
HAGEN Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.
MAMA You're Mikey's little girl.
KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.
MAMA You eat anything?
KAY shakes her head.
MAMA Disgrazia, you don't even give the poor girl a cup of coffee?
HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves toward MAMA, the letter extended.
KAY Will you give this letter to Michael.
HAGEN Mama, no.
MAMA You tell me what to do?
MAMA Even he don't tell me what to do.
She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.
KAY Why did they blame Michael?
MAMA You listen to me, you go home to your family, and you find a good young man and get married.
MAMA Forget about Mikey; he's no good for you, anymore.
She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what that means.
A hospital in New York City.
POLICE and teams of PRIVATE DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area.
An ambulance with a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying the DON.
TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing up the rear.
HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a moment they disappear behind the ambulance.
Then suddenly, siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung cars.
The Corleone Mall.
Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone Mall.
EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE
It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.
All is silent.
The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday clothes, wait.
One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway, preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a team of BUTTON MEN.
Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with a rifle on his lap.
Inside the Main CORLEONE House:
Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.
All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA, THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.
The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but been converted into a hospital room, with complete and extensive equipment.
The various CHILDREN get a turn to kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable...
and then SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO should leave.
They do, the door is closed.
The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the Sunday dinner, and set the table.
CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.
CONNIE What's the matter, Carlo?
CARLO Shut up.
All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN.
The DON does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.
HAGEN is the spokesman for the family.
HAGEN ...since McCluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on most of our operations...on the other families too.
HAGEN There's been a lot of bad blood.
The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.
SONNY Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
HAGEN We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
The OLD MAN nods.
SONNY Freddie's gonna go to Las Vegas...under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A. I want him to rest...
FREDO I'm goin' to learn the casino business.
The DON nods approvingly.
Then he searches around the room for a face he does not see.
HAGEN knows who he's looking for.
HAGEN Michael...
HAGEN It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.
The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and rage.
HAGEN He's safe now...we're already working on ways to bring him back.
The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they leave him alone.
HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is expansive and optimistic.
SONNY We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.
SONNY I want to get things going good before he gets better.
SONNY What's the matter with you?
HAGEN You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.
HAGEN We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
SONNY No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it.
SONNY They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
HAGEN Yes.
HAGEN That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
SONNY Well it's war!
SONNY We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.
SONNY Pop had Genco, who do I have?
SONNY Hey Tom, hey...hey.
SONNY It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.
SONNY Don't be sore.
The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table over Sunday dinner.
SONNY is at the head of the table.
SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally by the gate.
ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house.
A young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.
CONNIE and CARLO's apartment.
She's in a slip, on the phone.
We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.
CONNIE Who is this?
GIRL I'm a friend of Carlo's.
GIRL I just wanted to tell him I can't see him tonight; I have to go out of town.
CONNIE's face turns red.
CONNIE You lousy tramp bitch.
She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the bathroom drying his golden body.
CARLO What was that?
CONNIE Your girl friend.
CONNIE She says she can't make it tonight.
CONNIE You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number.
CONNIE I'll kill you, you bastard!
She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy belly heaving under the thin slip.
CARLO You're crazy.
CARLO She was kidding around; I don't know, some nut.
He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue dressing.
CONNIE You're staying home.
CONNIE You're not going out.
CARLO OK, OK.
CARLO You gonna make me something to eat at least?
That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and starts her wifely duties.
CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in the doorway.
CONNIE The food is on the table.
CARLO I'm not hungry yet.
CONNIE Eat it, it's on the table.
CARLO Ba Fa Goulle.
She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen.
A moment later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking.
CARLO slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.
CARLO You filthy guinea spoiled brat.
CARLO Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
CONNIE Like hell I will.
She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again.
Slowly, he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in his hand.
CARLO Clean it up!
He swings the belt against her heavy hips.
She moves back into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it ready.
CARLO Even the female Corleones are murderers.
He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her.
She makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids.
He pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process.
She gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table, gets her; and starts to slap her in the face.
She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.
CONNIE The baby!
CONNIE The baby!
She runs into the bedroom; he follows.
She moves into a corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide under the bed.
He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.
He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he throws her on the bed, contemptuously.
He grabs part of her thigh, pinching it very hard.
CARLO You're fat as a pig.
Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving her in tears.
She is crying; she pulls herself to the bedroom phone, and in a whisper:
CONNIE Mama...mama, it's Connie.
CONNIE Mama, I can't talk any louder.
CONNIE No, I don't want to talk to Sonny.
We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.
In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.
SONNY Yeah Connie.
CONNIE Sonny, just send a car to bring me home.
CONNIE I'll tell you then, it's nothing Sonny, don't you come.
CONNIE Send TOM, please Sonny, it's nothing; I just want to come home.
SONNY's face is turning red.
SONNY You wait there.
SONNY You just wait there.
He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.
SONNY That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...
HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he cannot interfere.
SONNY leaves the house.
HAGEN moves to the outside mall just as SONNY's car is driving off.
He moves to a group of
HAGEN Go after him.
SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.
After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is trailing.
SONNY is driving; he is very angry.
SONNY in his car; driving back.
Still breathing hard and still furious.
Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.
He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the
The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.
HAGEN This is Tom Hagen.
HAGEN I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.
BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.
BONASERA Yes, I understand.
BONASERA I'm listening.
HAGEN You owe the Don a service.
HAGEN In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.
HAGEN Be there to greet him.
HAGEN If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
Silence.
BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.
BONASERA Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
HAGEN Good.
HAGEN He never doubted you.
BONASERA The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
HAGEN Yes.
BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.
Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing.
His WIFE knows something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes from him.
He lights a cigarette.
BONASERA For the last year, they have been killing one another.
BONASERA So now, what?
BONASERA Your Godfather comes to me...Why?
BONASERA They've killed someone so important that they wish to make his body disappear.
MRS. BONASERA Amerigo!
BONASERA They could make me an accomplice to their murder.
BONASERA They could send me to jail!
He slips into his trousers.
Then he moves to his WIFE to tie his tie, as she has done for years.
BONASERA And if the other families find out...they will make me their enemy.
BONASERA They could come here to our house.
BONASERA I curse the day I ever went to the Godfather.
With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.
BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room, past the tables, and equipment.
He operates the chain that lifts a large overhead garage type door.
And looks out into the alley.
He sits on a bench, and waits.
The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley; we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral parlor.
CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.
BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak.
He notices TWO OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet protruding.
BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way the MEN should carry their sinister burden.
They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming room.
Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the darkness somewhat uncertainly.
It is DON CORLEONE.
He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking.
His cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.
Then, after a long gaze:
DON CORLEONE Well my friend, are you ready to do me this service?
BONASERA nods.
The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.
BONASERA What do you wish me to do?
DON CORLEONE I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.
DON CORLEONE I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
He draws down the gray blanket.
BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:
The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.
SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.
A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the car blocking him.
The windows of his car are shot out.
Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.
His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.
His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that he will survive it.
Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER fire.
His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.
A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and make off in the distance.
SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they are too late.
View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room.
He is silent a moment, and then:
HAGEN OK.
HAGEN Go to Clemenza's house and tell him to come here right away.
HAGEN He'll tell you what to do.
The MEN leave him alone.
He is quiet, standing in the middle of the living room a moment.
He looks in the direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA moving around.
TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the DON's room.
He opens the DON's door.
Looks in.
The DON in his hospital bed.
Asleep under sedation.
HAGEN hesitates.
He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN.
He closes the door.
HAGEN alone in the office.
He is drinking.
He looks up at the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving.
Then he hears footsteps.
The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE slowly enters the room.
He walks directly to his stuffed armchair, sits down.
His face is stern, as he looks into HAGEN's eyes.
DON CORLEONE Give me a drop of anisette.
HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.
DON CORLEONE My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.
DON CORLEONE So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
HAGEN I didn't tell Mama anything.
HAGEN I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.
HAGEN Just now.
DON CORLEONE But you needed a drink first.
HAGEN Yes.
DON CORLEONE Now you've had your drink.
Pause.
HAGEN They shot Sonny on the Causeway.
HAGEN He's dead.
DON CORLEONE blinks.
One feels that just for a second he loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.
DON CORLEONE I want no inquiries made.
DON CORLEONE No acts of vengeance.
DON CORLEONE Consigliere, arrange a meeting with the heads of the five families...this war stops now.
He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...
DON CORLEONE Call Bonasera...he will do me a service.
And leaves.
HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...
HAGEN This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
BONASERA Yes, I understand I'm listening.
HAGEN You owe the Don a service.
HAGEN He has no doubt that you will repay it.
Day in Manhattan.
An impressive Bank Building in the financial center of New York.
Many limousines are parked, uniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.
The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.
CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man, sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and settles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man; as the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:
DON CORLEONE I want to thank you all for coming.
DON CORLEONE I consider it a service done to me personally and I am in the debt of each and every one of you.
DON CORLEONE Especially those of you who have traveled from such distances as California, St.
DON CORLEONE Louis, Kansas City; and New Orleans...
The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA, short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair and a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at CONNIE's Wedding.
DON CORLEONE Ah well, let's get down to business.
DON CORLEONE We are all honorable men here, we don't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers.
DON CORLEONE How did things ever go so far?
DON CORLEONE Well, no matter.
DON CORLEONE A lot of foolishness has come to pass.
DON CORLEONE It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.
The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks.
A large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times, and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during the day's trading, and projected above.
DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.
DON CORLEONE Tattaglia has lost a son; I have lost a son.
DON CORLEONE We are quits.
DON CORLEONE Let there be a peace...
DON CORLEONE That is all I want...
BARZINI Don Corleone is too modest.
BARZINI He had the judges and politicians in his pocket and he refused to share them.
BARZINI His refusal is not the act of a friend.
BARZINI He takes the bread out of the mouths of our families.
BARZINI Times have changed, it's not like the old days where everyone can go his own way.
BARZINI If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians in New York, then he must share them or let others use them.
BARZINI Certainly he can present a bill for such services, we're not Communists, after all.
BARZINI But he has to let us draw water from the well.
BARZINI It's that simple.
DON CORLEONE My friends, I didn't refuse out of malice.
DON CORLEONE You all know me.
DON CORLEONE When have I ever refused an accommodation?
DON CORLEONE But why, this time?
DON CORLEONE Because I think this drug business will destroy us in the years to come.
DON CORLEONE It's not like whiskey or gambling or even women which most people want and is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the Church and the Government.
DON CORLEONE But drugs?
DON CORLEONE No.
DON CORLEONE Even policemen, who help us in gambling and other things would refuse to help us in drugs.
DON CORLEONE But...I am willing to do whatever all of you think is necessary.
DON ZALUCHI I don't believe in drugs.
DON ZALUCHI For years I paid my people extra so they wouldn't do that kind of business...$200 a week.
DON ZALUCHI But it didn't matter.
DON ZALUCHI Somebody comes to them and says, "I have powders, if you put up three, four thousand dollar investment, we can make fifty thousand distributing."
DON ZALUCHI Who can resist such a profit?
DON ZALUCHI There's no way to control it, as a business...to keep it respectable.
DON ZALUCHI I don't want it near schools!
DON ZALUCHI I don't want it sold to children.
DON ZALUCHI That is an infamita.
DON ZALUCHI In my city I would try to keep the traffic in the dark people, the colored.
DON ZALUCHI They are the best customers, the least troublesome, and they are animals anyway.
DON ZALUCHI They have no respect for their wives or their families or themselves.
DON ZALUCHI Let them lose their souls with drugs.
DON ZALUCHI But something has to be done, we can't have everybody running around doing just what they please, like a bunch of anarchists.
BARZINI Then, are we agreed; the traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled; and Don Corleone agrees to give it protection in the East.
DON CORLEONE nods.
BARZINI That's the whole matter then, we have the peace, and let me pay my respects to Don Corleone, whom we have all known over the years as a man of his word.
BARZINI Don Philip?
TATTAGLIA I agree to everything here, I'm willing to forget my own misfortune.
TATTAGLIA But I must hear strict assurance from Corleone.
TATTAGLIA When time goes by and his position becomes stronger, will he attempt any individual vengeance?
They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something else in mind.
Slowly the DON rises.
DON CORLEONE I forego my vengeance for my dead son, for the common good.
DON CORLEONE But I have selfish reasons.
DON CORLEONE My youngest son had to flee, accused of Sollozzo's murder, and I must now make arrangements so that he can come home with safety, cleared of all those false charges.
DON CORLEONE That is my affair, and I will make those arrangements.
DON CORLEONE But I am a superstitious man...and so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, or if he should hang himself in his cell, or if my son is struck by a bolt of lightning, then I will blame some of the people here.
DON CORLEONE That, I could never forgive, but...aside from that, let me swear by the souls of my Grandchildren that I will never be the one to break the peace we have made.
The DON's black limousine.
He sits quietly in the padded rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.
It is night.
Lights flash by them every so often.
HAGEN When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
DON CORLEONE Mention it, don't insist.
DON CORLEONE Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
HAGEN You mean Tattaglia.
DON CORLEONE Barzini.
HAGEN He was the one behind Sollozzo?
DON CORLEONE Tattaglia is a pimp.
DON CORLEONE He could never have outfought Santino.
DON CORLEONE But I wasn't sure until this day.
DON CORLEONE No, it was Barzini all along.
The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.
A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left grotesque and misshapen.
GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.
THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable, and with a pleasing build.
Each of the SHEPHERDS carry knapsacks.
The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape, overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.
The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make their way to a dusty rural road.
We HEAR a rinky horn sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.
An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.
The car pulls in front of them and stops.
MICHAEL nods respectfully.
MICHAEL Don Tommassino.
DON TOMMASSINO Michael, why must you do this.
DON TOMMASSINO We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.
DON TOMMASSINO It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
MICHAEL Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
DON TOMMASSINO You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
MICHAEL I know.
DON TOMMASSINO Where are you going?
MICHAEL Corleone.
DON TOMMASSINO There is nothing there.
DON TOMMASSINO Not anymore.
MICHAEL I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Long ago.
Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
MICHAEL Don Tommassino...I should see this place.
DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.
DON TOMMASSINO That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
MICHAEL No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.
DON TOMMASSINO Be careful Michael, don't let them know your name.
The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues on his journey.
The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit trees, in bloom and bursting with life.
They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the empty streets.
Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass.
And there are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.
The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main road "VOTA COMMUNISTA".
They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.
Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong, marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men carrying billowing red banners.
They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.
The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.
MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.
FABRIZZIO You tell us about America.
MICHAEL How do you know I come from America?
FABRIZZIO We hear.
FABRIZZIO We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
MICHAEL Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
FABRIZZIO Hey America!
FABRIZZIO Is she as rich as they say?
MICHAEL Yes.
FABRIZZIO Take me to America!
FABRIZZIO You need a good lupara in America?
FABRIZZIO You take me, I'll be the best man you got.
FABRIZZIO "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..."
MICHAEL laughs.
The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of the U.S. drivers, as they move by.
FABRIZZIO America.
FABRIZZIO Hey America!
FABRIZZIO Take me with you!
FABRIZZIO Hey, take me to America G.I.!
They continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until they hesitate, and look down.
CALO Corleone.
They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.
MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of the village.
They walk behind him, and spread to either side about fifteen feet away from him.
They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.
MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.
They go on.
They move up a very narrow old street.
MICHAEL looks at the doorways that they pass.
MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.
CALO sees MICHAEL looking.
CALO The names of the dead.
MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street.
He looks.
The street is empty, barren.
Occasionally, an old woman will pass.
MICHAEL turns his head.
The other side of the street: empty and deathly.
A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.
A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate.
Further ahead is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii.
There is a group of young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS, dressed in black.
They have been gathering the pink sulla, purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon blossoms.
They are singing, off in the distance as they work.
MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this Fantasy-like scene.
FABRIZZIO Hey, beautiful girls!
MICHAEL Shhhhh.
He settles down to watch.
The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that cling to their bodies.
They are still in their teens, but developed and womanly.
They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.
Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them playfully, in the direction of the grove.
The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws them back at her pursuers laughing.
They come closer and closer.
Just short of the grove, she poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the view of the THREE MEN.
She stands there on her toes about to run.
MICHAEL sees her; now face to face.
He looks.
Her face.
Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair and a rich mouth.
FABRIZZIO Jesus Christ, take my soul.
FABRIZZIO I'm dying.
Quickly, she turns, and runs away.
MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her.
We hold on him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS laughing.
Then he turns to them.
FABRIZZIO You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?
CALO pats him on the shoulder.
CALO Easy man.
MICHAEL What are you talking about?
FABRIZZIO You can't hide it when you're hit by the thunderbolt.
The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate, is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.
MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.
The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man; he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at their table.
FABRIZZIO You know all the girls in this town, eh?
FABRIZZIO We saw some beauties coming down the road.
FABRIZZIO One in particular got our friend hit with the Thunderbolt...
VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with new interest.
VITELLI You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight.
FABRIZZIO This one could seduce the devil.
FABRIZZIO A body!
FABRIZZIO and eyes as big and black as olives.
VITELLI I know about what you mean!
FABRIZZIO This was a beauty.
FABRIZZIO Right, Calo?
VITELLI Beautiful all over, eh?
FABRIZZIO And hair.
FABRIZZIO Black and curly, like a doll.
FABRIZZIO And such a mouth.
VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.
VITELLI Yes, we have beautiful girls here...
VITELLI but virtuous.
VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.
MICHAEL She wore a red dress, and a red ribbon in her hair.
MICHAEL She looks more Greek than Italian.
MICHAEL Do you know a beauty like that?
As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less, until he wears a scowl.
VITELLI No.
Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.
FABRIZZIO God in Heaven, I think I understand...
He goes into the back room after the innkeeper.
Then he returns.
FABRIZZIO Let's get out of here; he's boiling up his blood to do us mischief.
FABRIZZIO It's his daughter.
They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.
CALO Come quickly.
MICHAEL Innkeeper.
MICHAEL More wine!
FABRIZZIO The old bastard mentioned two sons he only has to whistle up.
MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.
MICHAEL Tell him to come to me.
The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI between them.
MICHAEL I understand I've offended you by talking about your daughter.
MICHAEL I offer you my apologies, I'm a stranger in this country, I don't know the customs very well.
MICHAEL Let me say this, I meant no disrespect to you or her...
CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.
VITELLI Who are you and what do you want from my daughter?
MICHAEL I am an American hiding in Sicily from the police of my country.
MICHAEL My name is Michael.
MICHAEL You can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband.
MICHAEL In any case, I want to meet your daughter.
MICHAEL With your permission and under the supervision of your family.
MICHAEL With all decorum.
MICHAEL With all respect.
MICHAEL I am an honorable man.
CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then asks:
VITELLI Are you a friend of the friends?
MICHAEL When the proper time comes, I'll tell you everything that a wife's father should know.
FABRIZZIO It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
VITELLI Come Sunday morning: My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
MICHAEL Your daughter's name?
VITELLI Appolonia.
MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an Alfa Romeo.
CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their luparas on their shoulders.
DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off, rocky and bouncing on the dirt road.
The Sunday churchbells ring.
MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.
Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate Sunday clothing.
Now he presents the wrapped gift to APPOLONIA.
She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives her permission to open it.
She unwraps it.
Her eyes light at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.
She looks at him.
APPOLONIA Grazia.
Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's cafe.
MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS, though they are all dressed differently.
They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is talking and talking.
MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.
She wears the gold necklace around her neck.
MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path, seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.
As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on their shoulders.
Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone, and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm.
She modestly regains her balance, and they continue walking.
Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.
Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out.
Music, old and dissonant, plays.
There is a bridal procession in the street of the village; the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five hundred years ago.
Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.
We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in Sicily.
APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.
CALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the great wedding celebration.
It is held in the Village Square; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the tops of buildings, carrying luparas.
MICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight fills the room.
He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA.
A little frightened; but lovely.
He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her, looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.
Slowly and tenderly he kisses her.
Her tiny hands come up to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.
She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.
Morning.
MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the room.
APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially covered by the bedsheets.
He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.
We HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost hitting th inner court wall.
APPOLONIA is laughing, driving.
MICHAEL pretends to be frightened, as he teaches her to drive.
Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking guard duty.
The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.
MICHAEL It's safer to teach you English.
APPOLONIA Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...See, I learned it.
APPOLONIA Now teach me to drive!
DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard.
He seems tired and concerned.
MICHAEL Ciao, Don Tommassino.
APPOLONIA kisses him.
MICHAEL Things went badly in Palermo?
DON TOMMASSINO The younger men have no respect.
DON TOMMASSINO Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.
DON TOMMASSINO Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
MICHAEL Is that why there are more men on the walls?
DON TOMMASSINO Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.
DON TOMMASSINO I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse.
DON TOMMASSINO You must go right away.
MICHAEL What is it?
DON TOMMASSINO Bad news from America.
DON TOMMASSINO Your brother, Santino.
DON TOMMASSINO He has been killed.
For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.
Morning.
MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.
Below, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs, combing his thick hair.
MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.
MICHAEL Get the car.
MICHAEL I'll be leaving in ten minutes.
MICHAEL Where's Calo?
FABRIZZIO Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.
FABRIZZIO Is your wife coming with you?
MICHAEL No, she's going home to her family.
MICHAEL She'll join me in a few weeks...
MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the kitchen.
CALO is just finishing a bite.
He rises when he sees MICHAEL.
CALO Should I get your bag?
MICHAEL No, I'll get it.
MICHAEL Where's Appolonia?
CALO She is sitting in the driver's seat of the car, dying to step on the gas.
CALO She'll be a real American woman before she gets to America.
MICHAEL smiles.
MICHAEL Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in the car.
He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.
He looks out from the opening in the doorway.
There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's seat, playing with the wheel like a child.
CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear seat.
Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.
Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO disappear through the gate.
MICHAEL Where the hell is he going?
MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.
MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.
APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay where he is.
APPOLONIA I'll drive to you.
He smiles affectionately.
CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling by his side.
There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.
Suddenly the smile fades from MICHAEL's face.
He steps forward and holds out his hand.
MICHAEL No.
MICHAEL No!
His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION, as she switched on the ignition.
Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.
MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.
MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room.
We hear whispering around him, but can't make any of it out.
A soft cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open.
DON TOMMASSINO is there, close to him.
He looks at them and from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.
MICHAEL Fabrizzio.
MICHAEL Let your shepherds know that the one who gives me Fabrizzio will own the finest pastures in Sicily.
Easter.
A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.
Hordes of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets, searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden Easter eggs.
The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.
Suddenly, he stops and looks.
MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.
Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in MICHAEL's direction.
MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son and embraces him.
DON CORLEONE Be my son...
DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the building.
DON CORLEONE This old building has seen its day.
DON CORLEONE No way to do business...too small, too old.
They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.
DON CORLEONE Have you thought about a wife?
DON CORLEONE A family?
MICHAEL No.
DON CORLEONE I understand, Michael.
DON CORLEONE But you must make a family, you know.
MICHAEL I want children, I want a family.
MICHAEL But I don't know when.
DON CORLEONE Accept what's happened, Michael.
MICHAEL I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.
MICHAEL From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
DON CORLEONE No, I wanted other things for you.
MICHAEL You wanted me to be your son.
DON CORLEONE Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
MICHAEL Then why have I become a man like you?
DON CORLEONE You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.
DON CORLEONE I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.
DON CORLEONE That was my misfortune.
DON CORLEONE That was your misfortune.
DON CORLEONE I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.
DON CORLEONE I had no choice.
MICHAEL A man has to choose what he will be.
MICHAEL I believe that.
DON CORLEONE What else do you believe in?
MICHAEL doesn't answer.
DON CORLEONE Believe in a family.
DON CORLEONE Can you believe in your country?
DON CORLEONE Those Pezzonovante of the State who decide what we shall do with our lives?
DON CORLEONE Who declare wars they wish us to fight in to protect what they own.
DON CORLEONE Do you put your fate in the hands of men whose only talent is that they tricked a bloc of people to vote for them?
DON CORLEONE Michael, in five years the Corleone family can be completely legitimate.
DON CORLEONE Very difficult things have to happen to make that possible.
DON CORLEONE I can't do them anymore, but you can, if you choose to.
MICHAEL listens.
DON CORLEONE Believe in a family; believe in a Code of Honor, older and higher, believe in Roots that go back thousands of years into your Race.
DON CORLEONE Make a family, Michael, and protect it.
DON CORLEONE These are our affairs, sono cosa nostra, Governments only protect men who have their own individual power.
DON CORLEONE Be one of those men...you have the choice.
A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.
FREDO There's a new one.
FREDO Construction going on everywhere.
MORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the bill marquees read: "MARTIN AND LEWIS", "PATTI PAGE", etc.
FREDO That's one of the family's new ones.
FREDO Not bad, eh?
The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.
Inside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man, NERI, quiet and sinister.
MICHAEL Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
FREDO He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a discourtesy.
A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI.
Great fuss is made.
They are being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.
FREDO You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.
FREDO That doctor did some job on your face.
MICHAEL You look good, too.
They enter the suite.
FREDO Nice, eh?
FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the bellboys, waiters and maids.
FREDO Kid, take a look-see.
MICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.
There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform, mirrors to each side.
FREDO points upward.
A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.
FREDO Ever seen anything like that before?
MICHAEL No.
MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom.
He is just finishing dressing; he puts on his jacket.
From the window, with the lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night.
MICHAEL passes into the other room.
He stops, looks.
He is disturbed.
A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite; a lavish table setting for eight.
Standing by the table are HAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier, beautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.
NERI stands quietly by the door.
FREDO Mike!
FREDO The party starting!
MICHAEL Come here a minute, Fredo.
FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.
MICHAEL Who are those girls?
FREDO That's for you to find out.
MICHAEL Give them some money and send them home.
FREDO Mike!
MICHAEL Get rid of them...
They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.
MICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.
MICHAEL Johnny, the Corleone family is thinking of selling out all our interests in the Olive Oil business and settling here.
MICHAEL Moe Greene will sell us his interest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the family.
FREDDIE seems anxious.
FREDO Mike, you sure about Moe selling.
FREDO He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
MICHAEL I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.
MICHAEL Johnny, the Don wants you to help us get started.
MICHAEL We figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers.
MICHAEL We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement.
MICHAEL We hope your friends in the movies will do the same.
MICHAEL We count on you to convince them.
JOHNNY Sure, I'll do anything for my Godfather.
JOHNNY You know that, Mike.
There is knock on the door.
NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL, who nods.
NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters, followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.
He is a handsome hood, dressed in the Hollywood style.
His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast style.
MOE Mike, good to see you.
MOE Got everything you want?
MICHAEL Thanks.
MOE The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!
MOE Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
MICHAEL Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
MOE laughs.
MOE Buy me out?...
MICHAEL The hotel, the casino.
MICHAEL The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.
NERI eyes the BODYGUARDS.
MOE The Corleone family wants to buy me out.
MOE I buy you out.
MOE You don't buy me out.
MICHAEL Your casino loses money.
MICHAEL Maybe we can do better.
MOE You think I scam?
MICHAEL You're unlucky.
MOE You goddamn dagos.
MOE I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
MICHAEL You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.
MICHAEL You and the Corleone family are evened out.
MICHAEL This is for business; name your price.
MOE The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.
MOE The Godfather is sick.
MOE You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.
MOE I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
MICHAEL Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
FREDO Ah Mike, that was nothing.
FREDO Moe didn't mean anything.
FREDO He flies off the handle sometimes; but me and him are good friends.
FREDO Right, Moe?
MOE Yeah sure.
MOE Sometimes I gotta kick asses to make this place run right.
MOE Freddie and I had a little argument and I had to straighten him out.
MICHAEL You straightened my brother out?
MOE Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.
MOE Players couldn't get a drink.
MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:
MICHAEL I have to go back to New York tomorrow.
MICHAEL Think of your price.
MOE You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?
MOE I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
FREDO Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
MICHAEL The Don has semi-retired.
MICHAEL I'm running the Family business now.
MICHAEL So anything you have to say, say it to me.
Nobody answers.
MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.
MOE exits angrily.
MICHAEL Freddie, you're my older brother.
MICHAEL I love you.
MICHAEL But don't ever take sides with anybody against the Family again.
KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark AIRPORT.
ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.
She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who plays with a cardboard bird on a string.
Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have learned to tell are bodyguards.
MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO PORTERS carrying luggage.
NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.
MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.
LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son.
Automatically, the luggage is put in.
NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver; and LAMPONE joins the other men.
HAGEN gets into one of the other cars.
And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other sedans.
The little BOY looks out the window as they drive.
MICHAEL I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
KAY Oh Michael.
MICHAEL We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
KAY Don't you want dinner first?
MICHAEL No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
KAY Wake me up when you come to bed?
The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding limousine window.
The limousine arrives at the Mall.
We are inside.
KAY Your sister wants to ask you something.
MICHAEL Let HER ask.
NERI opens the door.
KAY wants to talk just a little more.
KAY She's afraid to.
KAY Michael...
MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment longer.
KAY Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?
KAY They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
MICHAEL I'm busy.
KAY Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.
He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.
KAY Will you?
MICHAEL Let me think about it, O.K.?
She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.
VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size.
He wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt.
He sits in a chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.
TESSIO Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.
TESSIO Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
MICHAEL Just be patient.
TESSIO I'm not asking you for help, Mike.
TESSIO Just take off the handcuffs.
MICHAEL Be patient.
CLEMENZA We gotta fight sometime.
CLEMENZA Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
MICHAEL No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
TESSIO Mike, you're wrong.
CLEMENZA Don Corleone...Don Corleone.
The OLD MAN looks up.
CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.
Beside him is an anxious TESSIO.
NERI stands by the door; HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.
CLEMENZA You said there would come a day when Tessio and me could form our own Families.
CLEMENZA Only with your benediction, of course.
CLEMENZA I ask permission...
DON CORLEONE My son is head of the Family now.
DON CORLEONE If you have his permission, you have my good will.
MICHAEL In six months you can break off from the Corleone Family and go on your own.
MICHAEL Carlo, I'm counting on you to make the move to Nevada; you'll be my right-hand man out there.
MICHAEL Tom Hagen is no longer the Consigliere.
Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.
He remains inexpressive.
MICHAEL He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.
MICHAEL Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.
MICHAEL No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.
MICHAEL Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
CLEMENZA Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
MICHAEL Maybe less...
TESSIO Let us fill up our Regimes.
MICHAEL No.
MICHAEL I want things very calm for another six months.
TESSIO Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse.
TESSIO How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up?
TESSIO The two go hand in hand.
TESSIO And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us.
CLEMENZA And I don't like Barzini.
CLEMENZA I say the Corleone Family has to move from strength, not weakness.
CLEMENZA We should build our Regimes and take back our lost territories in Staten Island, at least.
DON CORLEONE Do you have faith in my judgement?
CLEMENZA Yes, Godfather...
DON CORLEONE Then do what Michael says...
MICHAEL All I can say is that things are being resolved that are more effective than a thousand buttonmen on the streets.
MICHAEL Understood?
There are uneasy looks all around.
CARLO Understood.
CARLO I just wish I was doing more to help out.
MICHAEL I'll come to you when I need you.
He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN.
They all nod, reluctantly.
MICHAEL All right, then it's resolved.
NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.
CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave, then CARLO.
NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.
Then NERI closes the door.
MICHAEL relaxes.
HAGEN Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
MICHAEL Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.
MICHAEL What could be more important than that.
HAGEN I'm not talking about that.
HAGEN I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.
HAGEN Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
DON CORLEONE I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
MICHAEL How did you find out?
HAGEN Bookkeepers know everything.
HAGEN Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.
HAGEN They get a little more money than the job's worth.
HAGEN Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
MICHAEL Not so perfectly if you noticed.
HAGEN Mike, why am I out?
MICHAEL You're not a wartime Consigliere.
MICHAEL Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
HAGEN OK, but then I agree with Tessio.
HAGEN You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness...
HAGEN Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
DON CORLEONE Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.
DON CORLEONE He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.
DON CORLEONE Michael has all my confidence, as you do.
DON CORLEONE For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
HAGEN Maybe I can help.
MICHAEL You're out, Tom.
TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.
TOM leaves.
MICHAEL looks at NERI.
MICHAEL I'm going to talk to my father.
NERI nods, and then leaves.
The DON opens the doors, breathes in the air, and steps outside.
DON CORLEONE I see you have your Luca Brasi.
MICHAEL I'll need him.
DON CORLEONE There are men in this world who demand to be killed.
DON CORLEONE They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender.
DON CORLEONE These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."
DON CORLEONE Luca Brasi was like that.
DON CORLEONE And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.
DON CORLEONE Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.
DON CORLEONE I think you have done the same with this man.
They walk through the DON's vegetable garden.
Tomatoes, peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.
MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.
Then stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.
DON CORLEONE Barzini will move against you first.
MICHAEL How?
DON CORLEONE He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust.
DON CORLEONE That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety...
He rises, and looks at Michael...
DON CORLEONE ...and at that meeting you will be assassinated.
The DON walks on further.
DON CORLEONE Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
MICHAEL Yes.
DON CORLEONE Good.
MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:
MICHAEL I've always respected you...
A long silence.
The DON smiles at MICHAEL.
DON CORLEONE And I...you.
KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left them off.
KAY How is your husband feeling?
MAMA He's not the same since they shot him.
MAMA He lets Michael do all the work.
MAMA He just plays the fool with his garden, his peppers, his tomatoes, as if he was some peasant still.
MAMA But men are like that...
She stops toward the Church.
MAMA You come in, too.
KAY shakes her head.
MAMA The Priest ain't gonna bite you cause you're not Catholic.
MAMA He's in the back drinkin' his wine.
KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.
They enter.
Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from the holy water.
MAMA You can.
Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and blesses herself.
Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally the Altar.
MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.
There is a large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles.
MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives her some.
MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights twenty candles.
She finishes, and bows her head.
Very few people in the streets.
TOTAL SILENCE.
But black flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.
An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.
Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.
Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration.
We show these in detail; and the flowered messages: "A Benefactor to Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"..."
Our Don Our Leader"..."
The Sacred Heart"...
Silence.
The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.
Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is somber and respectful.
MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform which holds the ornate coffin.
We cannot see the remains of Don Corleone.
BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved family.
One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.
The VIEW ALTERS,
and we see that the line is endless.
JOHNNY FONTANE, tears openly falling, takes his turn.
Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last look at the great man.
CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.
LAMPONE immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York Families to pay their respects.
First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.
Then PHILIP TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.
Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.
MICHAEL watches the scene.
BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined by his men.
As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don Corleone.
MICHAEL watches silently.
BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.
First CLEMENZA.
Then TESSIO.
CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.
He embraces and comforts her.
Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching all who come close to him.
Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are still hundreds of mourners.
A young GIRL approaches TESSIO.
She's about 18.
GIRL Do you remember me?
TESSIO No...
GIRL We danced together at Connie's wedding.
TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown', and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael.
He finds him.
TESSIO Mike, could I have a minute?
MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.
NERI is close by.
TESSIO Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
TESSIO Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
MICHAEL He talked to you?
TESSIO I can arrange security.
MICHAEL looks at him.
The Cemetery.
Late day.
The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in Queens Village.
Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take pictures, etc.
MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.
MICHAEL Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.
MICHAEL I really needed him.
HAGEN Did he give you his politicians?
MICHAEL Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.
MICHAEL I guess you've figured it all out?
HAGEN How will they come at you?
MICHAEL I know now.
MICHAEL I'll make them call me Don.
HAGEN Have you agreed on a meeting?
MICHAEL A week from tonight.
MICHAEL In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
HAGEN looks at him; understands.
MICHAEL But after the Baptism.
MICHAEL I've decided to stand as godfather to Connie's baby.
They look up.
The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel, with the bold inscription: CORLEONE.
ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he pulls a small trunk from under his bed.
He opens it, and we see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's uniform.
He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.
Then the badge, and the identification card; with his picture on it.
Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he begins to dress.
MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in their room.
MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is beginning to take on a matronly look.
In a Long Island motel.
ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it, checks it, and puts it back together.
PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln.
He hesitates, takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then gets in, drives off.
The Church.
Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the Church.
They laugh and talk.
A MONSIGNOR is officiating.
Not all of the participants have arrived yet.
CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.
She holds the infant; showing him off to interested people.
NERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN Building.
He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a policeman.
He carries a huge flashlight.
LAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising
The Church.
CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.
PRIEST Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless?
PRIEST Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
MICHAEL Yes, I promise.
NERI continues up the 55th St.
and Fifth Avenue area.
He continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.
On his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly across from the main entrance of the building.
Slowly he approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his nightstick.
The DRIVER looks up in surprise.
NERI points to the "No Parking" sign.
The DRIVER turns his head away.
NERI OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or you wanna move?
DRIVER You better check with your precinct.
NERI Move it!
The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately, and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's jacket.
NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.
Then he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.
NERI Let me see you license and registration.
LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.
It parks.
A young, pretty GIRL gets out.
Quickly, he returns into the room.
CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.
He rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.
The Church.
Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.
PRIEST Ephetha...be opened...So you may perceive the fragrance of God's sweetness.
The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center is arguing with NERI.
Now the DRIVER looks up.
TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving glass doors.
NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass doors.
The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of BARZINI within them.
In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL.
The PRIEST hands him the infant.
PRIEST Do you renounce Satan.
MICHAEL I do renounce him.
PRIEST And all his works?
MICHAEL I do renounce them.
LAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down the iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.
PHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a semi-nude young GIRL leans up.
They are riddled with gunfire.
CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with his package.
The PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant MICHAEL holds.
PRIEST Do you wish to be baptized?
MICHAEL I do wish to be baptized.
CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.
He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate elevator waiting shaft.
The lights indicate the elevator has arrived.
The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with the dapper MOE GREENE.
CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.
The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.
PRIEST I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.
Flash bulbs go off.
Everyone is smiles, and crowds around MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.
The christening party outside the Church.
Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.
Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.
As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up.
LAMPONE gets out and works his way to MICHAEL.
He whispers in his ear.
This is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.
CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.
CONNIE Kiss your Godfather.
The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an excuse to back away.
MICHAEL Carlo...we've had a change in the plans.
MICHAEL Mama, Connie, Kay and the kids will have to take the trip out to Vegas without us.
CONNIE Oh Mike, it's our first vacation together.
CARLO Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
MICHAEL Go back to your house and wait for me...
He kisses KAY.
MICHAEL I'll just be a couple of days...
People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to drive off.
TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.
HAGEN enters.
HAGEN You'd better make your call to Barzini; Michael's ready.
TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.
TESSIO We're on our way to Brooklyn.
He hangs up and smiles.
TESSIO I hope Mike can get us a good deal tonight.
HAGEN I'm sure he will.
The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car.
On their way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.
BUTTON MAN The boss says he'll come in a separate car.
BUTTON MAN He says for you two to go on ahead.
TESSIO Hell, he can't do that.
TESSIO It screws up all my arrangements.
THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.
HAGEN I can't go with you either, Tessio.
He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he panics, and then he accepts it.
TESSIO Tell Mike it was business...I always liked him.
HAGEN He understands that.
TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.
TESSIO Tom, can you get me off the hook?
TESSIO For old times' sake?
HAGEN I can't.
HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group.
Then about twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.
TESSIO is led into a waiting car.
HAGEN looks away, and walks off.
CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather nervously.
He moves to the window and looks out.
MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI, LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.
They move toward us.
Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.
He wears a broad smile.
CARLO Godfather!
MICHAEL You have to answer for Santino.
The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and backs into the living room.
The door opens, and the grim party enters.
MICHAEL You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.
MICHAEL That little farce you played out with my sister.
MICHAEL Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
CARLO I swear I'm innocent.
CARLO I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.
CARLO Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
MICHAEL Barzini is dead.
MICHAEL So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight.
MICHAEL So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.
MICHAEL Don't be frightened.
MICHAEL Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?
MICHAEL Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?
MICHAEL After all, I'm Godfather to your son.
MICHAEL No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.
MICHAEL I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.
MICHAEL I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all.
MICHAEL But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.
MICHAEL Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
CARLO Barzini.
MICHAEL Good, good.
MICHAEL Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.
CARLO moves to the door; opens it.
There is a car waiting; with a group of MEN around it.
He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.
MICHAEL I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on.
CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his things in the trunk.
ONE opens the front door for him.
SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.
CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back to see the other man.
It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.
The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.
He chokes and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.
The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.
His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.
Then the body goes slack.
CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car drives off.
MICHAEL and his party.
They watch.
Then he turns and walks off, and they follow.
MICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.
They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights flash by.
NERI turns back.
NERI You know I would never question anything you say.
MICHAEL Speak your mind.
NERI I'll do this for you; you know I should.
MICHAEL No.
MICHAEL This I have to do.
MICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an Italian Pizzeria.
NERI opens the door.
MICHAEL Sit in the car.
He walks alone into the restaurant.
A MAN is tossing pizza dough in the air.
MICHAEL Where's the boss?
MAN In the back.
MAN Hey Frank, someone wants you.
A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.
MAN What is it?
He stops, frozen in fear.
It is FABRIZZIO.
VIEW ON MICHAEL.
Gunfire from under his coat.
FABRIZZIO is cut down.
MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.
Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs indicating that the property is for sale are evident.
A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped, the rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out, restrained by MAMA.
She manages to break free and runs across the Mall into Michael's house.
Inside the Corleone house.
Big boxes have been packed; furniture prepared for shipping.
CONNIE Michael!
She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon MICHAEL and KAY.
KAY Connie...
But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL.
NERI is watchful.
CONNIE You lousy bastard; you killed my husband...
KAY Connie...
CONNIE You waited until our father died and nobody could stop you and you killed him, you killed him!
CONNIE You blamed him about Sonny, you always did, everybody did.
CONNIE But you never thought about me, never gave a damn about me.
CONNIE What am I going to do now, what am I going to do.
TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders from him.
But he stands there, waiting for his sister to finish.
KAY Connie, how could you say such things?
CONNIE Why do you think he kept Carlo on the Mall?
CONNIE All the time he knew he was going to kill my husband.
CONNIE But he didn't dare while my father was alive.
CONNIE And then he stood Godfather to our child.
CONNIE That coldhearted bastard.
CONNIE And do you know how many men he had killed with Carlo?
CONNIE Just read the papers.
CONNIE That's your husband.
She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria she has no saliva.
MICHAEL Get her home and get a doctor.
The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her, gently but firmly.
KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from MICHAEL.
He feels her look.
MICHAEL She's hysterical.
But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.
KAY Michael, it's not true.
KAY Please tell me.
MICHAEL Don't ask me.
KAY Tell me!
MICHAEL All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
KAY Is it true?
She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so directly that we know he will tell the truth.
MICHAEL No.
KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs him.
Then she kisses him.
KAY We both need a drink.
She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the drinks.
From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the house with their BODYGUARDS.
She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive them.
He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one foot slightly behind the other.
One hand on his hip, like a Roman Emperor.
