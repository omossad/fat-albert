G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA

November 3rd, 2007
DARKNESS.
SILENCE.
The following words sear onto screen: Whenever a new breed of evil emerges, a new breed of solider must fight it.
A HEAVY NIGHT MIST swirls around the imposing stone walls of the Bastille.
PRISON GUARDS patrol outside with their pikes as the SCREAMS OF PRISONERS echo out the barred windows.
A pair of huge PRISON GUARDS walk down a row of filthy prison cells.
Whimpering, starving PRISONERS appear and disappear in the flickering light of the wall torches.
A large rat nibbles some stale bread in the corner, watching the guards.
Finally, the two guards reach a cell whose PRISONER is not at all whimpering or starving.
A huge Scotsman with a proud defiance in his eyes, a RED SQUARE MEDALLION dangling around his neck, glares through the bars.
This is JAMES McCULLEN.
The guards unlock his cell door, MATCHLOCK MUSKETS at the ready.
McCullen stares at the muskets, unimpressed.
He speaks with a thick Scottish brogue.
MCCULLEN Still using matchlocks, are ya?
MCCULLEN I can get you a pair of flintlocks, you let me sneak out of here.
MCCULLEN Everyone else in this sequence speaks with a French accent.
Good ones?
The other Guard glares at him.
McCullen goes for the kill.
MCCULLEN The best.
MCCULLEN From Spain.
MCCULLEN And perhaps a couple of pretty young ladies to teach you how to use them.
MCCULLEN Guard #1 is even more tempted, but his partner is a Loyalist.
On yer feet, you Scottish pig.
Huge, sweaty, bare-chested PRISON WORKERS mould something in a furnace, a large chunk of metal in their red hot tongs.
The two prison guards muscle McCullen into the room and start to fasten him to a standing rack as a PRIEST begins reciting the Lord's Prayer in Latin.
The Warden steps up and reads the charges off a SCROLL OF PAPER.
WARDEN James McCullen, you have been found guilty of treason for the sale of military arms to the enemies of our Lord King Louis XIII...
WARDEN even whilst you sold arms to our Lord himself.
MCCULLEN Your King is a vile bag of filth who murders his own allies.
MCCULLEN I should've charged him double.
WARDEN You tried to overthrow the Crown in conspiracy with its enemies!
MCCULLEN They offered me a Chancellorship, because unlike your simpleton King, they know that is the McCullen destiny, to run the wars, the true power, not simply to supply arms.
WARDEN Do you have anything else to say before the sentence is carried out?
MCCULLEN Yes, I do.
MCCULLEN Clan McCullen is far bigger and more powerful than any of you could ever imagine.
MCCULLEN My sons will continue to rise along after I am gone.
MCCULLEN As will their sons.
MCCULLEN And, God willing, their sons.
It shall not end with my death.
The Warden smiles back sinisterly.
WARDEN Oh, we're not going to kill you, McCullen.
WARDEN We're going to make an example of you.
The Warden gives a nod to the prison workers who remove the METALLIC OBJECT from the fire.
McCullen sees what it is before we do and his face fills with fear.
It's a METAL MASK being carried towards him, the hinges open with a hideous creak.
McCullen begins to struggle against the rack.
So that no man, woman, nor child may ever see your treacherous face again, you shall wear this mask for the term of your natural life.
The mask closes around his face.
The workers melt the lock.
McCullen SCREAMS.
AND WE PUSH IN on the RED SQUARE MEDALLION.
The many flags of NATO flap outside its massive headquarters.
War used to be the exception.
Now it is the new state of play, a constant, unavoidable...
The RED SQUARE MEDALLION around the neck of JAMES McCULLEN, gazing over a lectern in a darkened room.
Like his doomed ancestor, McCullen carries a proud defiance in his eyes.
MCCULLEN Tragic as they are to fight, wars must be won.
MCCULLEN But perhaps they don't have to be as destructive as they've been in the past.
MCCULLEN A SERIES OF COMPLEX SCHEMATICS rolls continuously on a screen behind him.
MCCULLEN McCullen is briefing twenty-two NATO MILITARY COMMANDERS, many of them listening in TRANSLATION HEADPHONES.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Nano-mites.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Perfect little soldiers.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Their size can be programmed as well as their intended task.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Originally developed to isolate and destroy cancer cells, but at Mars Industries, and with the help of a little NATO funding...
A few laughs around the room.
McCullen soaks it up.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) .we discovered how to program them to eliminate most anything.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) For instance...
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) metal.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) ON SCREEN: A SOLDIER fires a shoulder-launched missile at a tank.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) The warhead bursts into millions of SILVER MICROSCOPIC NANO-MITES which eat away the metal like piranhas devouring a horse.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Then the NANO-MITES fan out from the consumed tank and quickly head for a nearby jeep.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Once the target has been destroyed, the launcher triggers a kill switch unique to each warhead that short- circuits the nano-mites, preventing any unwanted destruction.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) ON SCREEN: The Soldier hits a KILL SWITCH on the launcher and the NANO-MITES instantly "drop dead" around the nearby jeep.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Each warhead contains seven million nano-mites and has the ability to eat anything from a single tank to an entire city.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) But without innocent casualties.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Which is why this has been such a priority for me and my company.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) The room breaks into APPLAUSE.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) FOCUSES ON GENERAL HAWK, a British veteran or countless battles, not buying it.
HAWK Guess you'll be the first arms dealer up for the Nobel Peace Prize.
HAWK Laughter in the room.
HAWK McCullen smiles, being a good sport.
MCCULLEN I prefer the term "armament solutions engineer"
MCCULLEN Gentlemen!
MCCULLEN I'm pleased to announce that tomorrow morning your first order of nanotech warheads will ship from my factory in Kyrgyzstan.
FOUR GLASS-LIKE WARHEADS, each the size of a softball, are placed into four separate compartments inside a WEAPONS CASE by a pair of LAB WORKERS.
The KILL SWITCHES are secured next to each warhead.
As the case is closed and locked we see the MARS Industries RED SQUARE MEDALLION LOGO on its cover.
A PAIR OF DOG TAGS drop INTO FRAME in SLOW MOTION.
We see the name: "HAUSER, CONRAD R."
Still not seeing his face, we watch our soldier strap into his BODY ARMOR and clip on his BATTLE HARNESS.
His NAME TAG simply reads: "DUKE".
He loads his into the mirror (is that a look of disdain?)
and we get our first glimpse of our hero, a handsome, rugged combat veteran with a BATTLE SCAR under his right eye.
The sound of RETCHING comes from the stall behind Duke.
There is a flush and a strapping young Special Forces Soldier, STALWORTH, steps out.
He goes to the sink next to Duke and splashes water on his face.
He's pale and sweaty.
DUKE The hell's wrong with you, Stalworth, you didn't eat that Chicken A La King at chow did ya?
STALWORTH The mission, sir...
DUKE What about it?
DUKE Another day, another run.
STALWORTH Never had anything to worry about before.
STALWORTH Stalworth's shaky hand pulls a photo out and shows it to Duke: A YOUNG MOTHER with a NEWBORN in her arms.
Three weeks old.
Be seeing him for the first time next leave.
Duke looks at the picture, then at Stalworth.
His eyes go distant thinking about his own past, then they harden again.
DUKE You're off the mission.
STALWORTH Sir?
DUKE That's what you want, right?
DUKE Stalworth doesn't argue.
DUKE Duke hands him back the photo.
DUKE (CONT'D) If your head's with them, you're no good to me.
DUKE (CONT'D) Stalworth nods.
DUKE (CONT'D) Duke steps closer, now one mean s.o.b.
DUKE (CONT'D) One thing, though: you step off this one, you're out of Special Forces.
DUKE (CONT'D) Gonna find you a nice desk and chair back at the base.
DUKE (CONT'D) You're be run of the mill.
DUKE (CONT'D) Regular.
STALWORTH I...
STALWORTH I guess I can live with that.
DUKE Then you should.
DUKE Stalworth nods, grabs his kit, and leaves.
DUKE Duke's hard eyes watch him go, then a slight smile creases his lips ...
McCullen exits the briefing room into the corridor outside, shaking hands with various Military Commanders.
Hawk watches with his aide, a gorgeous German Lieutenant, COURTNEY "COVER GIRL" KRIEGER.
When McCullen is alone, Hawk makes his move.
HAWK Mr McCullen, Clayton Aernathy, British Army.
MCCULLEN I know who you are General hawk.
MCCULLEN As sharp in a briefing room as your reputation is on the battlefield.
HAWK Not hardly ...You gave me a broad target, I couldn't resist.
MCCULLEN It's an honor to meet a man of your many accomplishments.
MCCULLEN McCullen smiles, then offers Hawk to walk with him.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) What's on your mind, General?
HAWK Your warheads.
HAWK Securing them in transit.
HAWK Forty pairs of ears in that room now know the when and where.
MCCULLEN Those "ears" all have top security clearance.
HAWK We both know what that's worth.
MCCULLEN Look, General, delivery is my responsibility and it's not one I take lightly.
MCCULLEN I had NATO assign an elite American Special Forces unit, a fully armored convoy with air support.
MCCULLEN I assure you, my warheads will be quite safe.
HAWK I've made a career of showing up where I'm needed, whether ordered to or not.
HAWK And if your warheads are half as effective as you say they are..
HAWK Then my unit is needed.
MCCULLEN This is no time to play catch up.
MCCULLEN The NATO team's been drilling for weeks.
MCCULLEN They're lit up and ready to roll.
HAWK My unit doesn't need mission specific training.
HAWK They're chosen because of their ability to handle any situation.
MCCULLEN Maybe next time, General...
MCCULLEN What did you say your unit was called?
HAWK I didn't.
HAWK I just said they were always ready.
HAWK McCullen continues on down the hall.
HAWK Hawk gives Cover Girl a
look, she reads it and nods.
WE SMASH CUT TO:
A FOUR MAN SECURITY DETAIL escorts two LAB WORKERS as they enter a high-tech delivery bay and wlak past two "COUGAR" PATROL VEHICLES and a huge ARMORED "GRIZZLY TRUCK, all armed with state-of-the-art rooftop weapons.
FIFTEEN SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS stand at attention in front of Duke.
DUKE All right, listen up, the Cougars will be front and back, Grizzly in the middle carrying the package.
DUKE Minimum distance at all times.
DUKE Choppers will cover us overhead.
DUKE The Lab Workers step up.
Captain Hauser.
Duke turns to them and start signing forms as WALLACE "RIPCORD" WEEMS takes the case while a little short on academic credentials, Rip is long on confidence, charm, and courage.
These two guys are as close as brothers, for better and for worse.
Rip looks at the Lab Guy with a jokey grin.
RIPCORD Not gonna explode, is it?
They're not weaponized yet.
And the kill switches are attached to the launchers.
All the same, I'd avoid potholes if I were you.
Ripcord stares, then quickly hand the case off to another soldier.
Duke shoots him a look and Ripcord shrugs, what?
RIPCORD Why not stick it in a chopper and fly it out?
RIPCORD If you want, I could--
DUKE --We have our orders.
DUKE Okay, people!
DUKE We're on the clock, let's move.
Duke gives Rip another look.
Rip throws him a cheesy grin.
The team mounts up.
The weapons case to Grizzly.
ENGINES ignite.
HEADLIGHTS beam.
And the convoy rolls out.
The convoy charges out of the heavily guarded factory gates, passing a sign: "MILITARY ARMAMENTS RESEARCH SYNDICATE".
Two BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS swoop in and follow the convoy.
Ripcord drives the lead Cougar, Duke beside him.
Two more guys in back, remotely panning a rooftop DUAL MACHINE GUN.
DUKE Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog.
DUKE We have the package and are on the dot to make Ganci Air Base ar 0900.
RIPCORD You know, I hate all the Mother Goose, bird Dog crap, I just wish they'd let us say, "Hey, Pete, it's Bill, see ya in a few."
DUKE Not me, I joined up for the jargon.
Roger that, Bird Dog.
Mother Goose out.
RIPCORD Just saying, you know, if I ran things...
DUKE Rip, if you ran the Army we'd stay up all night, fill our canteen with tequila, and call each other "Bro".
RIPCORD But we'd be badasses, right Bro?
DUKE Yeah, we'd be badasses.
DUKE Eyes on the road, Rip.
The two Blackhawks sweep through the skies, silhouetted by the rising sun.
Below them, the convoy is thundering down a winding road amid the magnificent Tian Shan Mountain Range.
INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY A RADAR DISH on the rear Cougar sweeps vigilantly.
INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Inside, a SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER watches the RADAR MONITOR, clear except for two steady :signatures", the Blackhawks.
INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY In the lead Cougar, Duke and Ripcord keep their eyes out.
RIPCORD Hey Duke, ya know how they always tell you to empty your head of distracting thoughts on these runs?
DUKE Keep your eyes on the road, Rip.
RIPCORD And you know how people sometimes joke that it must be easy fr me to keep my mind empty?
DUKE Don't listen to 'em.
DUKE you got plenty of thoughts up there.
DUKE Keep rear security tight, boys.
RIPCORD Well, the second I try and make myself not have thoughts, I always have 'em.
RIPCORD Like now, know what I'm thinking about?
DUKE Please don't say the Air Forces.
RIPCORD The Air Forces.
DUKE I thought we were done with that discussion.
RIPCORD You were done with it, not me.
RIPCORD Look, I loev flying...
Duke "mouths" the following sentence as Ropcord says it:
RIPCORD (CONT'D) I've been flying since I was thirteen years old.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Ripcord shoots him a look.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Duke just smiles.
DUKE I don't think your daddy's crop duster counts as hours logged.
RIPCORD Jets, man, jets.
RIPCORD You know I always qualify when I'm on leave.
DUKE Yeah, yeah, look, you want to get up in the air, we'll get you a trampoline back at the base.
RIPCORD We've done ten years in the Army, I just think we should see if the grass really is greener.
DUKE This continues to be the stupidest idea you've ever come up with, nd that's saying something.
RIPCORD Funny.
RIPCORD Real funny.
DUKE I don't wanna transfer to the Air Force, okay?
RIPCORD It's always about you, isn't it?
RIPCORD Give me one good reason?
DUKE I want to be in the fight, not flying over it.
RIPCORD Won't be saying that when you call in an air strike and I come screaming in to save your--
DUKE --Eyes on the road, Rip.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Behind the Blackhawks and the convoy an ominous, DARK SHAPE suddenly drops INTO FRAME.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY ENGINE EXHAUST blurs our view of the aircraft, but we can tell that it's pursuing the convoy.
INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY On the rear Cougar's RADAR SCREEN, we see the two Blackhawk signatures still appearing in position..
INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY .but nothing else.
INT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY They hit a pothole.
INT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Ripcord grimaces, then realizes--
RIPCORD Hey, on the training run weren't there herders around here?
RIPCORD This puts Duke instantly on the alert.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Too late.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY CONCUSSION CANNONS slide out of ports on both sides of the dark shape.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY They fire simultaneously.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The SUBATOMIC BLASTS punch into the front Blackhawk, crushing it like a beer can on your forehead.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY It explodes and drops.
INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Duke and Rip see the hall of flaming metal crash in front of them, blocking the convoy's path.
INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Rip hits the brakes.
RIPCORD Jesus Christ!
RIPCORD Bird Down!
DUKE Back up!
DUKE Back up!
DUKE Back up!
DUKE Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog.
DUKE We are under attack.
DUKE Repeat --we are under attack!
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The second Blackhawk pivots to see the dark shape, --it's like a giant helicopter without rotors, hovering on six JET THRUSTERS.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY It's a next-gen "TYPHOON" GUNSHIP.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The Blackhawk hoses the Typhoon with its six-barrelled MINI- GUNS.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY But the rounds bounce off the Typhoon's angled armor.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The CONCUSSION CANNONS fire at the second Blackhawk, catching it on the nose, crushing it into a flaming ball and sending it reeling ass-over-tail-rotor into the ground behind the rear Cougar, hemming in the convoy.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The Grizzly launches two HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES off its roof- turret, but the Typhoon guns them down and fires again.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The blast lands directly on top of the rear Cougar, literally flattening it as well as every tree within a hundred feet.
Duke sees it all in his rear view mirror, yells into RADIO:
DUKE Out!
DUKE Everyone get out of the vehicles!
DUKE Now!
A final CONCUSSION BLAST lands between the last two vehicles now.
Spinning the Grizzly.
It's WINDOWS SHATTER and a thousand lethal GLASS SHARDS shoot inside, killing the drivers.
The Cougar flips end over and lands in a ditch.
INT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Duke and Ripcord land on the upturned ceiling, beat to shit.
INT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Duke quickly checks on the two guys in back crushed to death where the blast caved in the Cougar's armor.
INT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY He looks at Rip.
DUKE You okay?
Yeah, except for all the blood.
Duke sees blood on the back of Rip's head.
Then they hear a LOUD ROAR and turn to see the Typhoon hover by the Grizzly.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Who the hell is that?
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Duke grabs Ripcord and starts dragging him out.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY A SIDE DOOR on the Typhoon hisses open to reveal six "VIPERS", menacing foot soldiers clad head to toe in black BATTLE ARMOR, and armed with fearsome PULSE RIFLES.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY They exit the Typhoon and spread out to kill anyone left.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The decimated Special Forces troops in the Grizzly OPEN FIRE with ASSAULT RIFLES, but the bullets can't penetrate the Viers' armor.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The Vipers fire back, the impact from their pulse rifles crush the soldiers' bodies, armor and all, and fling them backwards.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Two Soldiers pop two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES and toss them toward the Typhoon.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The Vipers shoot one grenade out of the air with their pulse rifles.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY It EXPLODES well out of range as the other grenade lands on the ground int he middle of the pack.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Another shot from a pulse rifle punches the grenade six feet underground.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY A DULL WHOOMP, lifts the ground by a foot.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Meanwhile, another figure emerges out of the Typhoon.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Long, slender legs in high black boots, the rest if her covered in black, form-fitting BODY ARMOR.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY She's beautiful, exotic, and most of all, lethal.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY She's known in certain circles only as "THE BARONESS" but we will know her as ANA.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY Her DARK GLASSES glint menacingly as she strides towards the Grizzly.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The two Special Forces Soldiers who threw the grenades pop up to shoot her.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY But she quick-draws a pair of PULSE PISTOLS.
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY BOOM!
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY BOOM!
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The shots crush both soldiers.
Ana flips the pistols back into her holsters as a Viper blows the back door off the Grizzly, allowing her to climb inside.
She blithely steps around the corpses and removes the WEAPONS
Duke now has Rip ver his shouders and is running like hell.
RIPCORD Duke?
DUKE Shut up.
RIPCORD If I die...
DUKE You're not gonna die.
RIPCORD I just want you to know...
RIPCORD you never could run worth a damn.
DUKE Jesus, Rip.
RIPCORD I'm just saying, it's be nice if you could move a little faster.
RIPCORD And that's when the Cougar blows, a concussive blast.
RIPCORD Ana turns with the weapons case in time to see Duke and Rip go ass-over-teacups down into a ditch.
RIPCORD She touches the stem of her glasses which ZOOM IN on Duke.
RIPCORD DOWN IN THE DITCH: Duke rolls over and looks at Rip.
DUKE Stay here.
RIPCORD Sure.
DUKE I'm gettin' that package.
DUKE Duke leaps up and hauls-ass down the ditch, then crouch-runs up the embankment.
DUKE --And comes face to face with a Viper, who raises his pulse rifle, about to blow Duke away.
DUKE A hand clamps down over the barrel.
DUKE The Viper looks at Ana beside him.
DUKE Duke also looks at her, a flash of shocking recognition ripples across his face.
Ana touches the stem of her glasses and the DARK LENSES turn clear, revealing her gorgeous eyes.
DUKE (CONT'D) What the hell...?
DUKE (CONT'D) Her face softens hesitantly.
ANA Hello, Duke...
ANA Then she round house kicks him with her boot across the face, knocks him out on his ass.
ANA (CONT'D) You have to admit you had that coming.
ANA (CONT'D) Ana struggles with something going on inside her head.
ANA (CONT'D) Then her face reluctantly hardens and she takes her hand off the first Viper's gun barrel, giving Duke an apologetic look.
ANA (CONT'D) Good-bye, Duke.
ANA (CONT'D) Duke can't believe it.
ANA (CONT'D) Ana suddenly glances up at something behind Duke.
ANA (CONT'D) It's a "HOWLER" TRANSPORT rocketing onto the scene, its four-winged JET THRUSTERS rotating ninety degrees to slow it into a hover.
ANA (CONT'D) Duke takes the opportunity to jump to his feet and lay out in the Viper.
ANA (CONT'D) Ana turns and hauls- ass.
ANA (CONT'D) A BLACK-CLAD FIGURE fast ropes down out of the Howler and lands behind a Viper and SNAPS his neck.
ANA (CONT'D) Moving in a blur, he draws and buries a KATANA BLADE into another Viper.
ANA (CONT'D) Then he glances at the last Viper who's lining up on him, too far away to reach with his sword.
ANA (CONT'D) He quick-draws a GLOCK PISTOL.
ANA (CONT'D) BAM!
ANA (CONT'D) Right between the eye slit in his helmet.
ANA (CONT'D) All this in the space of six breathless seconds.
ANA (CONT'D) Duke glances at the almost mystical figure of SNAKE-EYES sheathing his sword on his back while holstering his smoking Glock.
ANA (CONT'D) RED NINJA CLAN MARKING on his tri-cep.
ANA (CONT'D) Bad-ass defined.
ANA (CONT'D) Snake-Eyes leaps behind the Cougar wreck as a pulse burst just missed him.
ANA (CONT'D) Duke immediately takes off after Ana, his eyes locked on the weapons case in her hands, PULSE
BURSTS crackling past his head.
He curses under his breath:
DUKE Air Force..
DUKE .right.
A Viper lines up on Duke, but a laser-like ARROW BOLT rips through his eye-slit and ELECTROCUTES him, courtesy of SHANA "SCARLETT" O'HARA who fast-ropes down from the Howler, holding a gas-propulsion CROSSBOW PISTOL.
She lines up on another Viper, but he's too quick, ducks behind the GRIZZLY.
But Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL viewfinder snapped an image of his FACE ARMOR.
She darts behind the COUGAR WRECK with Snake- Eyes, swiftly targeting the Viper's eye-slit on her pistol's LED SCREEN.
Then she fires behind her, in the complete other direction to the Viper, the arrow bolt flies away, then turns around and zeroes in on the Viper, finding him behind cover, the smart-arrow slams right through his eye-slit.
Another Viper sees this and bolts toward the Typhoon, but LAMONT "HEAVY DUTY" MORRIS leans out of the landing Howler holding a dual MACHINE GUN/GRENADE LAUNCHER.
Only a man this big can carry such a weapon.
HEAVY DUTY Time to lay down some bass!
HEAVY DUTY He fires a grenade and the Viper flies back OUT OF FRAME.
HEAVY DUTY You blink, you miss it.
HEAVY DUTY BOOM!
HEAVY DUTY The Typhoon fires at Heavy Duty, but the Howler is just as nimble, fires its LEFT-SIDE THRUSTERS which roll it onto its side.
HEAVY DUTY The CONCUSSION BLASTS whip past and decimate the forest behind it.
HEAVY DUTY Hanging awkwardly, Heavy Duty fires a double blast of hand grenades.
HEAVY DUTY The Typhoon's mini-gun quickly shoots them out of the air.
HEAVY DUTY The Howler fires MISSILES which hit the CONCUSSION CANNONS and rip them apart.
HEAVY DUTY The Typhoon SHAKES.
HEAVY DUTY Ana races for the recovering Typhoon.
HEAVY DUTY Duke races after her through a hail of pulse-fire and draws his PISTOL.
DUKE Ana!
DUKE She whirls around, drawing the weapons case over her chest and face, using it as a shield.
DUKE Duke hesitates, because of the warheads or Ana?
DUKE Heavy Duty goes to shoot at her.
SCARLETT The warheads!
SCARLETT Heavy Duty reluctantly doesn't shoot, everyone watching Ana backpedal towards the waiting Typhoon.
SCARLETT Duke charges like a bull and tackles her.
SCARLETT Ana sprawls and the case tumbles free.
SCARLETT Duke and Ana go eye-to-eye for a split second, then Duke goes after the case while the Joes take the opportunity to spray gunfire her way.
SCARLETT Ana zigs, zags, and dives into the Typhoon, which is raked by the bullets.
Duke grabs up the case as the Typhoon launches into the sky and disappears over a rise ...
SILENCE...
Scarlett, Snake-eyes and Heavy Duty now approach Duke, who whirls around at them, pistol up, eyes wild.
DUKE Stand down!
DUKE Stand the hell down!
HEAVY DUTY Lower your weapon, Sir.
HEAVY DUTY We're not the enemy.
DUKE Pointing weapons at me doesn't make you my friend.
DUKE ABEL "BREAKER" SHAZ jumps out of the Howler wearing a
computerized SURVEILLANCE SUIT, a French/Tunisian ACCENT:
BREAKER Please hand over the case, sir.
DUKE I don't know who you are, and I sure as hell don't know who they are, and until I find out, I'm not lowering anything or handling anything over.
DUKE CLICK-CLACK.
DUKE They turn to see Ripcord shouldering a rifle.
RIPCORD What's your unit?
SCARLETT That's classified.
SCARLETT Snake-Eyes discreetly grabs SHRUNKEN THROWING STARS from his belt, but a look from Scarlett makes him out them back.
BREAKER Someone would like a word with you.
BREAKER Breaker sets a holo-projector on the ground in front of Duke, which projects a 3D IMAGE OF GENERAL HAWK.
BREAKER Duke is stunned.
HAWK State you name and rank.
DUKE .you first.
HAWK My team just saved your life.
HAWK now's the part where you say "thank you".
DUKE Those aren't the words that come to mind just now.
DUKE We weren't told about any support for this mission, so you better tell your team to stand down.
DUKE Ripcord eyes his sight.
RIPCORD Happy to turn this into a turkey shoot.
RIPCORD Someone OFF-PROJECTOR hands Hawk a file, he looks at it.
HAWK You must be...
HAWK Ripcord, expert marksman, weapons specialist, jet
RIPCORD Told ya.
HAWK I'm General Clayton Abernathy.
HAWK You may have heard of me, .Duke.
HAWK A glint of recognition flickers across Duke's eyes, he nods.
DUKE General hawk.
DUKE Afghanistan, NATO Forward Command...
DUKE Breaker sees his chance and gingerly steps up to Duke and starts sweeping a scanner across the case.
DUKE Hawk smiles.
HAWK That was my last job.
HAWK I'm in a whole new outfit now.
HAWK Duke swivels his gun to Breaker's head.
HAWK Breaker flinches.
BREAKER Just need to deactivate its tracking beacon, for security.
HAWK Hand over the weapons case son, and let us deliver the warheads.
DUKE No way.
DUKE I signed for 'em.
DUKE My mission, my package.
DUKE I carry them, I deliver them.
DUKE Breaker's scanner BEEPS.
DUKE He keys a button.
DUKE The BEEPING promptly stops.
DUKE He throws a look at Duke.
BREAKER Wasn't hard, was it?
DUKE Fine.
DUKE But you seem to be a little short on transportation a the moment.
DUKE Team Alpha will deliver you to me.
DUKE (CONT'D) And where exactly are you, General?
INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY Hawk stands in front of a HOLO-CAM amongst a sea of computers, Cover Girl behind him, Duke on a monitor.
HAWK Come see for yourself.
The Howler skims over the GIANT PYRAMIDS OF GIZA, a caravan of camels below.
The aircraft continues out into the golden desert, too fast for anybody to get a good look at it.
Scarlett is cleaning Ripcord's head wound.
RIPCORD Hey, you're cute.
SCARLETT He's going into shock.
RIPCORD What's your name, darlin'?
Snake-Eyes stabs Ripcord hard int he arm with a drip-needle, Rip angrily eyeballs him and stifles a scream.
SCARLETT I thought all the Special Ops guys were tough.
RIPCORD We are tough ...
RIPCORD but also sensitive.
RIPCORD Whoa, that's some mucho primo stuff you gave me.
RIPCORD Rip is high now, his eyes float up to Heavy Duty who stares back at him.
RIPCORD Rip reaches out to touch his well-cropped hair.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) .and a kung-fu grip.
HEAVY DUTY The name's Heavy Duty.
HEAVY DUTY Duke has the weapons case on his lap.
DUKE What kind of outfit is this?
DUKE Not regular Army based on the accents.
DUKE I have you as an Aussie...
DUKE And you're a Johannesburger...
DUKE And you: French North Africa.
DUKE Algiers?
BREAKER Tunisia.
BREAKER Where were you born?
RIPCORD Are you kidding me?
RIPCORD Duke wasn't born, he was Government-Issued!
DUKE But somehow you're all in the same unit.
DUKE One you can't tell me the name of right?
SCARLETT We'd get tossed for telling.
Duke, Duke, don't you get it: they're super secret, they're Mission Impossible.
This tape's gonna self-destruct in five--
DUKE --You're gonna go after them aren't you?
DUKE The ones that hit my convoy.
Then whoever you are, whatever this unit is, I want in.
BREAKER Not our call.
BREAKER Ripcord sits up, really woozy, looks at Scarlett.
RIPCORD I want in too.
RIPCORD That way we can spend some bunker time together.
RIPCORD A SWORD suddenly slices across Rip's face, an inch away.
RIPCORD It's Snake-Eyes, checking his blade, seemingly innocent.
RIPCORD But the message is not lost on Ripcord.
RIPCORD Scarlett looks at Duke.
SCARLETT You two a team or something?
RIPCORD We've been together forever.
RIPCORD But not like that.
RIPCORD Hi, I'm Ripcord.
SCARLETT Why do they call you that?
Breaker laughs, reading Ripcord's file:
BREAKER Because his name is Wallace Weems!
Eight SECURITY TECHNICIANS sit around an island console in a small, windowless room.
Working their keyboards and watching the HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE of the Howler soaring across the dunes.
A technician hits a LARGE SWITCH on his console.
SECURITY TECHNICIAN #1 Alpha-One, this is Base.
SECURITY TECHNICIAN #1 You are cleared or entry.
And a huge sand dune directly in front of Howler spirals open to reveal a CAVERNOUS HOLE.
The Howler's THRUSTERS twist vertical and it drops like a helicopter into the hole.
SUPER: Global Integrated Joint Operating Entity.
INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY The Howler descends beneath the surface onto a dark platform as the roof spirals shut and FLOOD LIGHTS switch on.
INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY The door of the howler opens and the team steps out.
INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY Duke and Ripcord follow hesitantly with the weapons case.
INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY A VOICE calls out to
them from the shadows:
HAWK Welcome to the new Pit!
HAWK Duke and Ripcord turn to see hawk and Cover girl walking out from behind the lights.
HAWK (CONT'D) Duke.
DUKE General.
HAWK I've read a lot about you two.
RIPCORD Okay, look, I didn't "steal" that Blackhawk, I was borrowing it...
RIPCORD Duke shoots him a look.
RIPCORD Hawk steps right up to Duke.
HAWK Matter of fact, I saw that one of my subordinates tried to recruit you to our little operation a while back.
DUKE I was never asked to join any Op group.
HAWK Remember a tall gentleman approaching you in Thailand when you were on leave, four years ago?
DUKE Vaguely.
HAWK Right before you tore up the bar?
RIPCORD Four years?
RIPCORD My man had some issues.
RIPCORD Duke shoots him another look, then turns back to Hawk.
DUKE This doesn't look like any Tac Op I've ever seen.
DUKE Where are we?
HAWK Okay, you trusted me by going with my team, so I'll trust you.
HAWK There's a loud METALLIC CLANG and part of the PLATFORM begins to descend.
HAWK They pass the URBAN COMBAT LEVEL where MEN and WOMEN are training with next-gen urban warfare equipment.
HAWK (CONT'D) Technically, GI JOE doesn't exist.
HAWK (CONT'D) But if it did, it'd be comprised of the top men and women from the best military units all over the world.
HAWK (CONT'D) The alpha dogs...
HAWK (CONT'D) They see a pretty woman sip into a next-gen CAMO-SUIT, which reflects and refracts light, making her nearly invisible.
RIPCORD Oh man, I want one of those.
BREAKER The suit or the girl?
RIPCORD Both.
RIPCORD Scarlett's eyes roll.
RIPCORD They descend into the DESERT COMBAT level, where soldiers train with desert warfare equipment.
HAWK Ten nations signed on in their first year.
HAWK Working together, sharing intel.
HAWK Now we have twenty- three.
DUKE I've never seen combat gear this sleek, what's the trick?
SCARLETT Liquid armor.
SCARLETT They reach the DEEP SEA COMBAT LEVEL where dozens of men and women are testing fantastic next-gen UNDERWATER VEHICLES.
HAWK Good news is we've been pretty successful so far.
HAWK The bad news is whenever we manage to shut down one organization, another springs up in its place.
RIPCORD Who could possibly fund all this?
HEAVY DUTY Oprah.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY Hawk now leads the group into the Control Room where more TECHNICIANS man consoles.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY Duke still has the weapons case.
Mr. McCullen's standing by, Sir.
HAWK Patch him through, please.
DUKE So who hit us out there?
COVER GIRL Currently unidentified.
HEAVY DUTY And how'd that bitch in leather get a jump jet like ours?
SCARLETT Whoever she is, she's clearly well- financed, with access to highly classified intel and state of the art weaponry.
SCARLETT Their capabilities are beyond anything we've ever encountered.
RIPCORD That's the reason we got our asses kicked.
RIPCORD Duke betrays nothing.
RIPCORD Hawk looks at him.
HAWK We're going to need to find out everything we can about her.
HAWK Knowing is half the battle.
RIPCORD What's the other half?
RIPCORD McCullen now appears next to Ripcord and walks through him.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Jesus!
RIPCORD (CONT'D) And we realize McCullen is here courtesy of a HOLO-PROJECTOR.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) A ring of cameras provides him with images of the Joes.
HAWK Gentlemen, this is James McCullen, CEO of MARS Industries, the man who built these warheads.
HAWK WE INTERCUT THIS SCENE WITH McCullen standing in front of a HOLO-CAM in a small room somewhere.
HAWK THE HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGES of hawk, Duke, and the others around him.
MCCULLEN General, most men I've encountered in this business over-promise and under-deliver.
MCCULLEN You're the opposite.
MCCULLEN Clearly, you were the security option I should have chosen.
MCCULLEN ON DUKE: Steaming behind his military demeanor.
DUKE My team did everything we could out there.
DUKE A lot of good men went down--
MCCULLEN --But not you.
DUKE That mission was classified, sir.
DUKE Clearly, somebody sold us out.
MCCULLEN I've spent ten years and thirteen billion Euros creating these four warheads.
MCCULLEN Your job, Captain, was to protect them, and if it wasn't for General Hawk, you would've failed.
HAWK That's not a fair assessment.
HAWK He followed his orders to the letter.
MCCULLEN Well that wasn't enough.
MCCULLEN Duke bristles.
MCCULLEN McCullen turns to Hawk.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) What are your coordinates?
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) I'll have NATO send another special ops team to retrieve the warheads, company strength this time.
HAWK Apologizes, Mr McCullen.
HAWK It's not that I don't trust you...I don't trust anybody.
Are you sure you're not a McCullen?
HAWK I don't talk smooth enough to be a McCullen.
MCCULLEN You do just fine, General.
MCCULLEN Now, so the bastards who attacked you can't find you, you need to disable the tracking beacon hidden in the case.
BREAKER We already have.
MCCULLEN Good man.
MCCULLEN So, can I count on you to deliver the warheads to NATO now?
HAWK I think it unwise to expose them at the moment.
HAWK This group might make another attempt.
HAWK (CONT'D) We need to find and neutralize them before we can consider moving your weapons.
MCCULLEN Alright.
MCCULLEN But allow me to check the warheads to see if any have been damaged.
MCCULLEN Duke begrudgingly sets the case down.
MCCULLEN Breaker turns on his suit's BALL-EYEPIECE.
MCCULLEN It goes into X-RAY MODE and we see the NANO-MITES crawling around inside the four warheads.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Open it, please.
BREAKER My scan says they're intact...
MCCULLEN General?
HAWK What's the code?
HAWK ON DUKE, listening carefully.
MCCULLEN Five-two-nine-four-four-oh.
MCCULLEN Breaker enters the code.
MCCULLEN As the case opens, Breaker discreetly watches McCullen in his BALL-EYEPIECE SCANNER.
MCCULLEN McCullen runs his holographic fingers over the warheads.
MCCULLEN Satisfied, he turns to Hawk.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Please keep me informed of your progress, General.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Duke and McCullen share a quick glare.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) And then McCullen cuts the feed.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Scarlett notices concern on Breaker's face.
SCARLETT Breaker?
BREAKER That bloke's Beta waves were going up, down, and sideways...
BREAKER I think he's hiding something.
And off the faces of the rest of the group WE CUT BACK TO:
McCullen turns as Ana appears on a HOLO-PROJECTOR behind him.
MCCULLEN I spend five years setting this up.
MCCULLEN Wringing money out of NATO.
MCCULLEN This was supposed to be the easy part.
ANA If you'd let me stage the assault at your precious factory, we could have contained the situation.
MCCULLEN And lost the trust of our clients in the process?
MCCULLEN It had to be NATO's fault.
MCCULLEN What happened?
MCCULLEN Did you hesitate?
ANA You're implying this was about some ancient history?
ANA That's as laughable as your Intel.
ANA What went wrong was the Joes appearing out of nowhere.
ANA He stares at her suspiciously, then softens.
MCCULLEN Forgive me, jealousy isn't my strong suit.
ANA Forget that, where are we now?
ANA Have you tracked the case?
MCCULLEN They deactivated the beacon.
MCCULLEN I gave them a code to quietly re-arm it.
MCCULLEN McCullen hits a key, a SCREEN switches on, displaying A MAP OF THE WORLD.
MCCULLEN A BEACON LIGHT flashes over a spot in the Egyptian desert, grip coordinates blinking.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) There it is.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) The infamous Pit.
ANA I will get those warheads back.
McCullen steps forward and lovingly caresses her face, his hand going right through her.
McCullen whispers menacingly.
MCCULLEN I hope so.
ANA If I were really there, I might actually let you touch me.
MCCULLEN I'll send a jet.
ANA Business first.
ANA Besides, I'm married, remember?
ANA Her holo-form blinks off, leaving McCullen alone in the room.
MCCULLEN Sometimes I really hate technology.
He sighs heavily, then hears a VOICE:
STORM SHADOW It is most often used by those without honor.
STORM SHADOW McCullen turns to see STORM SHADOW, a well-tailored Korean man whose soul has long since departed, standing on the other side of the room.
MCCULLEN There can't be any more mistakes.
MCCULLEN The schedule can't be compromised any further.
STORM SHADOW If you had sent me, it would be done.
MCCULLEN I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow.
MCCULLEN To the Baroness's villa.
MCCULLEN .Make sure her commitment doesn't waiver.
MCCULLEN Storm Shadow nods, McCullen continues on THROUGH him.
MCCULLEN We now realize Storm Shadow was a holo-proj.
MCCULLEN Storm Shadow vanishes.
McCullen steps up to a large oval perspex window.
WE PULL BACK out of the window to reveal that he's riding through DEEP ARCTIC OCEAN inside a next-gen "TRIDENT" submarine.
CAMERA KEEPS PULLING BACK to show the Trident approaching the docking bay of a MASSIVE FACILITY built into the seabed under the jagged canopy of the POLAR ICE CAP.
The place is defended by several HARPOON CANNONS and a fearsome TURBO-LASER.
It's a breath-taking sight, but also a little frightening.
The MARS LOGO is stamped on a pair of WATER-TIGHT DOORS.
The logo pulls apart as the doors open, allowing McCullen inside the docking back entrance.
Waiting for him is a man known only as THE DOCTOR.
His face hidden by a life-support mask that continually pumps air into his lungs and also mechanically helps him to speak without the vocal chords he is missing.
THE DOCTOR Welcome back.
MCCULLEN Good to be back.
THE DOCTOR we've been very busy.
THE DOCTOR He gestures to TWENTY MERCENARIES or various ethnicities, all standing at attention, not a single muscle moving among them.
THE DOCTOR These are NEO-VIPERS.
THE DOCTOR The baddest of the bad.
MCCULLEN Is it working?
THE DOCTOR You tell me.
THE DOCTOR The Doctor beckons a waiting LAB ASSISTANT who rolls out a glass case containing an eighteen foot long KING COBRA.
THE DOCTOR the Doctor bends down and gazes at the snake.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) The King Cobra is a magnificent creature.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Its venom can kill a full grown elephant with a single bite.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) He rattles the case and the cobra HISSES at him, revealing its hood.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) The Doctor steps up to a Neo-Viper and shows McCullen an INCISION SCAR behind the Neo-Vipers' right ears.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) We introduced into each subject one thousand cc's of the nano-mite solution.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) As expected, subjects became extremely ill and fell into a coma-like state for approximately forty hours.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) The Doctor produces a small HANDHELD DEVICE from his pocket, A FILE PHOTO of a Neo-Viper appears on the device's screen.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) When they returned to sentience, brain scans showed complete inactivity in the self-preservation region of the cortex.
MCCULLEN English, Doctor.
MCCULLEN The Doctor keys a demand and that particular Neo-Viper steps up and sticks his bare arm into the case through a portal.
THE DOCTOR They feel no fear.
THE DOCTOR The Neo-Viper grabs the cobra and squeezes, the cobra bites his arm, latching on, sinking its venom into his veins.
THE DOCTOR The Neo-Viper doesn't even wince.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Cortical nerve clusters revealed complete inactivity--
MCCULLEN --Doctor.
THE DOCTOR They feel no pain.
THE DOCTOR The Doctor keys another command and the Neo-Viper obediently lets go of the cobra and removes his arm from the case.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Frontal lobe concepts of morality are disengaged...
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) No remorse...
MCCULLEN And they are completely obedient?
THE DOCTOR Of course.
THE DOCTOR .The real world applications are endless.
The Neo-Viper's knees give out.
McCullen watches curiously.
WE SMASH CUT INTO the NEO-VIPER'S BITE WOUND where the WHITE VENOM is racing through a blinding labyrinth of veins.
The nano-mites will target the venom.
STILL IN HIS VEINS we see hundreds of MICROSCOPIC NON-MITES rushing to meet the venom head on.
Blocking it.
Then swiftly pushing it back.
All the way to the original fang holes.
The venom seeps out of the holes and drips off the Neo-Viper's arm.
He stands and returns to his place in line without a word.
The Doctor looks at impressed McCullen.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) So you tell me: is it working?
The Doctor follows McCullen through various corridors.
THE DOCTOR The science is staggering isn't it?
MCCULLEN You've done well.
MCCULLEN You've thrown the caber clear out of the yard.
THE DOCTOR But research and science are expensive propositions.
THE DOCTOR If I can make a suggestion..?
THE DOCTOR McCullen stops and looks at him, there is something truly menacing and evil behind this Doctor's mask.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Selling one batch of warheads on the black market could fund--
MCCULLEN --I appreciate your thirst for knowledge, Doctor.
MCCULLEN But this world is messy enough.
MCCULLEN Factions fighting and scrabbling for control, for resources, and it's only going to get worse as the century progresses.
MCCULLEN No.
MCCULLEN What the world needs is unification.
MCCULLEN Leadership.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) It needs to be taken out of chaos by someone with complete control.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) He looks through a portal into a shadowy OPERATING CHAMBER, where a brilliant but vicious looking MAN is being scanned by SMART ROBOTS.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) This is ZARTAN.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) A Smart Robot begins to change Zartan's fingerprints, which we see on a monitor.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) My family was once this close to that kind of power...
The French...
Zartan CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and gives McCullen a nod.
McCullen looks back at the Doctor.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Once I get my hands on the reins, the money will take care of itself.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) You'll be able to do all the research you want.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) McCullen strides off.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) The Doctor stares after him.
Duke, still holding the briefcase, stares at a PHOTO OF ANA from the ambush, now up on a monitor.
BREAKER We grabbed an image from Heavy- Duty's helmet cam.
Ripcord looks stunned, he leans closer to Duke and whispers:
RIPCORD Hey, that's-- Duke cuts him off with a look.
RIPCORD Breaker extracts a full 3D FRONT-VIEW of Ana's face from the photo.
RIPCORD Then on an adjacent monitor, he runs an endless series of PHOTOS OF WOMEN.
BREAKER Now we can run the face through an infinity scan.
HAWK We have access to any photograph on any server anywhere in the world.
BREAKER Everyone gets photographed in some way at some time.
BREAKER ATM machines, airports, crowd shots at a football game.
BREAKER We'll find her.
Duke just stares at Ana's photo.
Ripcord whispers quietly:
RIPCORD You okay?
DUKE .what happened to her?
DUKE For once, Ripcord doesn't know what to say.
DUKE Cover Girl walks in and hands a document to Hawk, who looks through it.
HAWK From NATO.
HAWK I am now the official custodian of the warheads.
HAWK Your mission is complete.
HAWK Once you hand it over, that is.
HAWK Duke nods, hands over the case with a hint of defeat.
DUKE When you move it, she's gonna come after you, you know that, right?
DUKE And with her Intel, and her toys...
DUKE she'll find you.
HAWK And your point is...?
DUKE You're going to go after her first.
DUKE And I want to help.
RIPCORD Let us in on this, General.
RIPCORD Our team just got wasted.
RIPCORD I think a little payback is in order.
HAWK You don't ask to be a part of GI JOE.
HAWK You get asked.
DUKE You scouted me four years ago, now I'm ready.
DUKE Let's have at it.
HAWK I've lost men too, Captain.
HAWK Good men.
HAWK But attempting to--
DUKE I know her.
HAWK Excuse me?
DUKE You said knowing is half the battle.
DUKE Well, I know who she is.
DUKE Duke reaches into his pocket, pulls out a photo and shows Hawk.
DUKE INSERT PHOTO: Ana, four years earlier, much softer looking, staring lovingly at Duke as they're about to kiss.
DUKE (CONT'D) Her name is Ana Lewis, and I can tell you everything you need to know about her until...
DUKE (CONT'D) four years ago.
DUKE (CONT'D) After that, well, obviously sa lot's changed.
DUKE (CONT'D) Hawk just stares in disbelief.
Hawk sits down behind his desk and looks up at Duke, still standing at attention.
HAWK Before this goes any further, I need to know what I'm dealing with, a man looking to settle a score, or a man who can put the mission first.
HAWK Because the battlefield is the wrong place for emotion.
HAWK Could you kill her?
DUKE If I had to.
HAWK Chances are you will.
HAWK But if you flinch, hesitate even an instant...
HAWK what I'm trying to say is, unless you can kill her graveyard dead I don't want you.
DUKE I can.
DUKE I signed on to deliver those warheads, General, and despite your present authority, I want to finish the job.
DUKE Hawk regards him for a moment.
HAWK So tell me about her.
DUKE Okay, I'll start right here: I hope that vault is tight, because she always gets what she wants...
A BLACK, BEEFED-UP SUV drives towards a magnificent mansion in the Parisian suburbs.
Though the vehicle looks relatively harmless, we'll come to know it as a "SCARAB" attack truck.
Ana enters the mansion.
SERVANTS take her coat as her handsome, sophisticated and well dressed husband, BARON LEON DECOBRAY, glides up to her, very French.
They kiss warmly.
DECOBRAY Hello, darling.
ANA How is work at the lab?
DECOBRAY Steady progress.
ANA So the Minister of Defense was pleased?
DECOBRAY He was.
DECOBRAY You know I wish I could tell you more...
ANA Of course.
DECOBRAY You were gone a long time.
DECOBRAY How were the shops in Monte Carlo?
ANA I didn't get what I was after.
ANA They head up the stairs.
DECOBRAY I suppose I should be grateful.
ANA Most husbands would be.
DECOBRAY Most husbands don't have such mysterious wives, they know exactly where they are and what they do.
They think they know.
Ana throws open the double doors to her grand bedroom on a high floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower.
ANA I never get over how beautiful...
DECOBRAY Neither do I.
DECOBRAY She spots Storm Shadow standing in an ante room and quickly spins to face her husband.
DECOBRAY She pulls Decobray close and kisses him.
DECOBRAY Storm Shadow makes a move, but ana warns him off with her eyes, She finishes the kiss and looks at Decobray.
ANA Let me change and freshen up and I'll meet you for dinner.
DECOBRAY Of course.
DECOBRAY Decobray smiles at her and leaves.
DECOBRAY The smile falls from Ana's face as she spins around and heads for Storm Shadow.
STORM SHADOW Mr. McCullen gave me explicit orders to sever the Baron's spine if he so much as touched you.
ANA He's my husband, of course he touches me.
ANA Tell McCullen to grow up.
ANA Besides, the Baron says his work in the lab goes much better after we've...
ANA touched.
ANA And that's the important thing.
STORM SHADOW I'll be accompanying you to retrieve the warheads this time.
STORM SHADOW Along with some of the men the Doctor's been working on.
ANA The Doctor.
STORM SHADOW We go at dawn.
STORM SHADOW Storm Shadow turns and heads out through the doors.
STORM SHADOW Ana Stands alone in her room now, she heads over to her dresser and opens a hidden drawer.
STORM SHADOW Inside is a SMALL BOX.
STORM SHADOW She opens it carefully and gazes at an ENGAGEMENT RING inside.
Something sad and lonely in her eyes...
And WE FLASHBACK TO:
A crowded military club.
OFFICERS and ENLISTED dancing to an orchestra.
And there's Ana, the most beautiful woman in the room.
Wearing a black dress.
Slightly younger and with none of the cold viciousness she displayed earlier.
She's dancing with Duke who's wearing his officer's DRESS UNIFORM, replete with bars and medals.
She laughs as Duke whispers something in her ear.
She's in love.
And so is he.
Ripcord is in a booth, downing shots with four ENLISTED WOMEN.
He has his arms around two of them and looks loaded.
RIPCORD My hot tub only holds four.
No, five.
Duke leads Ana outside onto a quiet verandah, the lights of Washington shimmering beyond them.
He suddenly kneels down in front of her, an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box in his hand.
Ana gasps with shock and joy, tears welling in her eyes.
DUKE I've been wanting to do this before we deploy.
ANA Duke...it's beautiful.
ANA It's too nice you lunatic.
DUKE Only time I'm buying one of these, so why not?
DUKE They stare a each other, a touching beat.
DUKE Then Duke screws up his face, worried?
DUKE (CONT'D) Well, what do you say?
She's too emotional to speak.
And then they hear:
REX Say yes, you idiot...!
REX Lieutenant REX LEWIS saunters up, MEDICAL INSIGNIA on his collar.
REX The look on his face tells us he's happy for them.
REX (CONT'D) .Before I tell my new brother-in- law what it's like to share a bathroom with you.
DUKE Thanks for killing the mood, Rex.
REX I was coming to offer you a ride back to post.
ANA Time already?
DUKE We go at oh-five hundred.
ANA Is it WMDs?
ANA It is, right?
ANA That's why you're pulling Rex out of the
DUKE Ana, we can't--
ANA Yeah, yeah.
ANA Classified.
ANA Top Secret.
ANA Have to kill me if you told me, blah, blah, blah.
DUKE Speaking of classified information, you still haven't answered.
ANA Yes.
ANA Of course it's yes.
ANA On one
She grabs REX and pulls him down on his knees next to Duke.
ANA (CONT'D) Promise me that you won't let my genius egghead brother get hurt.
ANA (CONT'D) He's the only family I've got left.
ANA (CONT'D) Promise me.
DUKE I promise.
DUKE She smiles and holds out her hand.
DUKE He threads the ring onto her trembling finger.
DUKE Rex smiles, but in his eyes is a glint of instability.
DUKE Ripcord comes CRASHING OUT through shuttered doors and sprawls out next to them, arms and legs akimbo.
DUKE (CONT'D) Jesus, Rip.
Ripcord rolls over and yells back through the doors:
RIPCORD How was I supposed know she was married!?
RIPCORD Nice rock!
RIPCORD Hey, are you proposing?
DUKE I'm done proposing.
ANA I already said yes.
RIPCORD Not official until you answer my question.
RIPCORD Do you love my boy?
ANA Always and forever.
ANA Ripcord flips open his CELL PHONE and takes the photo of Ana that Duke carries with him.
RIPCORD Now I've gotta find someone to love me, as many times as possible for the next three hours.
RIPCORD WE PUSH IN ON THE PHOTO, then SMASH CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.
On Duke, watching Heavy Duty pulling out an ACCELERATOR SUIT.
HEAVY DUTY If you want to join us, you'll need to be mission ready, Joe style.
HEAVY DUTY This is the Mark One Accelerator Suit.
RIPCORD What's it accelerate?
HEAVY DUTY You.
HEAVY DUTY It'll make you run faster, jump higher, and hit harder than any of your enemies.
HEAVY DUTY A TITANIUM BOOT slides over a shoe.
HEAVY DUTY COBALT MACHINE PARTS snap into place with a HISS over Duke and Rip's arms and legs.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) Head-to-toe turbo-hydraulics and highly-pressurized pneumatics.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) They both slap on aerodynamic, flying-wing HELMETS.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) Inside, the CYBERNETIC POWER-UP with an ear piercing whine.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) LASER ENHANCED LED readouts scramble and fritz across their HUDs.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) An advanced cybernetics heads-up display, feeding into your helmet.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) Duke checks out two gas-propelled GRAPPLING SPEARS and six WRIST ROCKETS around his right forearm.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) Two gas propelled grappling spears and six ten millimeter, hi- explosive, heat seeking, fire-and- forget rockers.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) Rip spins the twin barrels of a caseless SUBMACHINE GUN on his left forearm.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) A Cheshire grin spreads across his face.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) And a nine millimeter, caseless submachine gun with six hundred rounds capable of firing all of them in thirty seconds.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) Duke and Ripcord are now buckled in, getting a feel for the FLEXIBLE, POLY-ALLOY SUITS.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) Ripcord glances at Heavy Duty.
RIPCORD I just missed everything you said.
RIPCORD How do I look?
RIPCORD Pretty cool, huh?
Duke and Ripcord run through and URBAN ENVIRONMENT OBSTACLE COURSE, 3D HOLO-PROJECTION TERRORISTS lunging out at them.
The guys take them out one by one, never more than a split second after they appear.
The HOLO-PROJECTIONS fritz and die.
They reach the end of the and a BUZZER SOUNDS.
At the back, arms crossed, impassively taking it all in, is Hawk.
Scarlett approaches the guys with an ELECTRONIC CLIPBOARD.
SCARLETT Sixty-three seconds.
SCARLETT Not Bad.
SCARLETT But not good enough.
SCARLETT Gotta get under a minute to qualify.
DUKE What's the record?
SCARLETT Forty-five.
RIPCORD Don't tell me, Snake-Eyes?
SCARLETT No, me.
SCARLETT Ripcord glances at Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL.
RIPCORD You can do this whole course with that thing in forty-five seconds?
SCARLETT If you're going to shoot at something, kill it.
SCARLETT Otherwise take up knitting.
RIPCORD When I want something, I don't just shoot at it...
RIPCORD When I get a target in my sights, I take it down.
RIPCORD His meaning is clear.
RIPCORD She holds his gaze, slaps a magazine into her CROSSBOW PISTOL and hands it to him.
SCARLETT Here.
SCARLETT Go on.
SCARLETT Try it.
RIPCORD I wouldn't want to show you up.
SCARLETT Oh, that's so thoughtful of you.
RIPCORD What can I tell you?
RIPCORD I guess I'm just a considerate, humble guy.
RIPCORD You'll learn that about me.
SCARLETT I'm the "target in your sights," right?
SCARLETT You've got ten rounds to "take me down".
RIPCORD I don't want to hurt you.
SCARLETT They're training arrows.
SCARLETT The most I'll feel is a little jolt.
Scarlett walks back and faces him.
He glances aside at Duke who is loving this.
Ripcord readies the pistol.
Scarlett darts left.
He shoots and misses.
She darts right.
He misses.
DUKE C'mon, Rip.
DUKE Ripcord tries harder, genuinely doing his best.
DUKE But Scarlett us too fast.
DUKE Ducking and weaving around Ripcord, as nimble as a cat.
DUKE Five more shots miss her.
DUKE And now Ripcord's feeling the pressure.
DUKE He waits for her to move.
DUKE Fires.
DUKE She leaps up onto a corner wall and the bolt passes underneath.
DUKE He fires again as she lands, ducks under it and rolls up to him.
DUKE He fires his last bolt point blank.
DUKE She catches it in her left hand by the stem as it leaves the chamber.
DUKE Slamming her body up against his.
DUKE Right hand behind his head, left hand holding the bolt.
DUKE Their faces close.
DUKE Lips closer.
Ripcord's eyes on hers as he whispers:
SCARLETT Guess you didn't really want me that bad, rip.
SCARLETT She holds his eyes a moment longer, then lets him go.
SCARLETT As she walks away, Scarlett casually tosses the ARROW, it hits the ground and EXPLODES.
SCARLETT Ripcord and Duke jump back.
SCARLETT Ripcord glances at the underside of the pistol's magazine.
SCARLETT Three words: "CAUTION: LIVE BOLTS".
SCARLETT Both men watch Scarlett saunter back to the beginning of the course, awestruck.
SCARLETT Breaker walks by eating a burrito and watching his bio-rhythm display.
BREAKER Aw, Ripcord's heart just skipped a beat.
BREAKER Isn't that sweet?
The sun is sinking, turning the dunes a brilliant orange.
INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT Security works a console in the Security Room.
INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT Their infrared monitors show a HERDSMAN AND HIS CAMELS walking across the desert dunes.
INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT A Technician taps some keys and an X-RAY IMAGE shows the skeletal structures of the herdsman and his camels.
The HERDSMAN walks across the desert with his CAMELS under a FULL MOON and a field of glittering stars.
All of a sudden, MULTIPLE MOUNDS OF SAND whip past his feet, almost knocking him over.
He stares at them as they abruptly disappear deeper under the sand, like diving submarines.
Ana drives the lead MOLE POD, an oblong-shaped digging device that is just large enough for her to fit inside.
She watches her HUD relay information about her angle of decent and her distance to the target.
Thirty yards...twenty yards...ten...
A light flashes on the console in the security room.
SECURITY TECHNICIAN #1 Sensors detecting seismic activity to the southwest.
SECURITY TECHNICIAN #1 Probably just a tremor, but have a team check it.
Ripcord and the other Joes watch as Duke and Snake-Eyes circle one another with special ELECTRIFIED PUGIL STICKS.
Duke thrusts with a standard bayonet style move, Snake-Eyes side steps it, spins his pugil stick above his head and brings it down on Duke's head with a sword-like stroke.
A CRACKLING SHOCK is delivered and Duke goes down.
The Joes grimace, feeling Duke's pain.
Snake-Eyes turns away, done with him.
Duke pops back up again.
DUKE Again.
DUKE They go at each other, fast and furious, the electrified pugil sticks crackling and sparking.
DUKE Duke spins and attempts a stroke similar to Snake-Eyes' earlier move.
DUKE Snake-Eyes blocks it, drops, and sweeps Duke's feet, taking him down hard before finishing him with another SPARKING HIT.
DUKE Again, the Joes react.
DUKE Snake-Eyes turns away.
DUKE Duke shakes it off and pops to his feet once more.
DUKE (CONT'D) Again.
Snake-Eyes nods, a little more respect in his eyes now.
This time after the high blows are parried, Snake-Eyes tries the sweep.
Duke jumps it, rolls, comes up behind Snake-Eyes and STRIKES.
Snake-Eyes barely blocks it.
They trade half a dozen blows, the electricity popping and crackling before Snake-Eyes tries a finishing blow.
Duke stuffs it with his stick and tackles Snake-Eyes.
They fall to the ground, both receiving JOLTS.
They go eye-to-eye.
It wasn't pretty, but Duke is getting effective.
Snake-Eyes pops to his feet.
This time he offers a hand to pull Duke up.
Across the room, Hawk watches with approval.
The huge drill bit of Ana's mole machine bursts out of the reinforced clay wall, it opens and retracts, Ana rolls out and drops to the ground.
Another huge drill bursts out, it retracts and opens and Storm Shadow drops to the ground.
They look around.
They're between the clay wall and the ELECTRIFIED POWER GRID FENCE of the Pit's generator station.
ANA The foundation of this fence is a hundred feet deep.
ANA No going under.
ANA Ten Neo-Viper mole pods start to burst out the wall.
ANA And then there's a crashing sound as one of the wall girders bends, obviously a mole machine in the clay behind it hit it.
ANA Ana can hear the engine grind to a halt.
ANA (CONT'D) If we don't get him out he'll suffocate.
ANA (CONT'D) Storm Shadow gives her a look: Like I care?
ANA (CONT'D) Just thought I'd mention it.
STORM SHADOW All that matters is the mission.
STORM SHADOW Ana pulls out a hi-tech SCANNING DEVICE which shoots out six STEEL BLUE BEAMS in a 360 DEGREE ARC, creating a DETAILED SCHEMATIC of the Pit, showing rooms and people moving about them.
STORM SHADOW She points down a tunnel beyond the electrified fence.
STORM SHADOW Storm Shadow gestures to one of the Neo-Vipers.
STORM SHADOW The Man immediately walks over and grabs the fence, electricity JOLTS him violently, but the man ignores it and shakily starts climbing the fence.
STORM SHADOW The skin on his hands and arms starts to burn and bubble.
STORM SHADOW (CONT'D) Acceptable collateral damage.
ANA Is there any other?
ANA Near the top the Man finally falls backward and drops down dead.
ANA Storm Shadow nods to the next Viper.
ANA Without hesitation the Man walks over and grabs the fence.
ANA He is immediately JOLTED, but keeps climbing, burning and bubbling.
ANA This guy makes it to the top, throws himself over, and crashes to the ground, then crawls over and pulls the OFF SWITCH, cutting the electricity before dropping dead himself.
ANA Ana, Storm Shadow and the others quickly scale the fence.
An area where the Joe team chills.
Duke and Ripcord enter, sore and worked over.
They move to some couches.
Heavy Duty grooves to the blasting Reggaeton classic "Salio El Sol".
HEAVY DUTY You can learn a whole hell of a lot about a girl by the way she dances.
HEAVY DUTY Tell me I'm wrong Snake-Eyes.
HEAVY DUTY Snake-Eyes, sharpening his sword, barely looks up.
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) See?
HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) He agrees.
SCARLETT No, he doesn't.
SCARLETT Do you?
SCARLETT This time Snake-eyes looks up, his expression unreadable.
SCARLETT (CONT'D) See, he knows you have to listen to get to know someone.
SCARLETT (CONT'D) Right, Rip?
SCARLETT (CONT'D) Rip is happily stowing his liquid armor gear, glances over.
RIPCORD What?
RIPCORD You say something?
RIPCORD Breaker sits at a chessboard.
RIPCORD Heavy D sits across from him.
BREAKER Sorry, Scarlett, gotta go with Heavy D on this one.
BREAKER (CONT'D) Like my man says, get a girl on the floor, you don't just see how she moves, you get the smell of her.
BREAKER (CONT'D) What biologists tell us is that the decision is made by he nose long before the rest of the body gets involved.
BREAKER (CONT'D) It's a question of pheromones.
SCARLETT You're going to teach me science?
SCARLETT I read all about the positron emission tomography studies concerning sex pheromones when I was twelve.
SCARLETT I'm just saying, it's not very romantic.
SCARLETT Rip whispers to Duke, nodding towards Scarlett.
RIPCORD Heavy told me she graduated college at twelve.
RIPCORD No response from Duke, who is trying to get comfortable.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) She's like a freaky genius.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) A deadly, freaky genius.
DUKE You like her, I get it already.
BREAKER You can't learn this stuff in a book, Scarlett.
BREAKER You have to at least kiss a guy, before you're an expert on romance.
BREAKER The guys all laugh.
BREAKER Scarlett blushes, then raises her bow.
SCARLETT Who am I shooting first?
SCARLETT The laughter stops.
SCARLETT Rip looks surprised.
RIPCORD You haven't kissed anyone?
RIPCORD Now Scarlett looks really furious.
RIPCORD Rip instantly wishes he could take his words back.
RIPCORD Duke just shakes his head.
DUKE Really firing on all cylinders there, Rip.
HEAVY DUTY All I know is, when the bass get's that booty shaking in the right way, I'm in the skin like a man named Flynn.
HEAVY DUTY Heavy Duty does a little freak dance.
HEAVY DUTY Scarlett makes a show of disgust.
HEAVY DUTY Ripcord watches Scarlett, then makes a decision.
RIPCORD Hell with it.
RIPCORD He strides across the room toward Scarlett.
RIPCORD Breaker notices.
BREAKER Into the Valley of Death rode the
Heavy Duty looks at him, confused.
Breaker nods to Ripcord, stopping near Scarlett's chair.
Ripcord sees Snake-Eyes taking in his every move.
Scarlett now has her nose in a book.
Ripcord CLEARS HIS THROAT but she doesn't look up.
He peers closer and WE SEE THE COVER, on which, though in English, is a damn near INDECIPHERABLE SCIENTIFIC TITLE.
RIPCORD Beach reading, huh?
RIPCORD She groans and lowers the book only slightly.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Hi, I guess we kinda got off on the wrong foot...
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Without changing expression she goes back to her book.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Okay look, I'm attracted to you.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) And you, you're attracted to me.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) And him--
RIPCORD (CONT'D) The Zen Master, he creeps me out, but what I'm saying is--
SCARLETT "We're attracted to one another."
RIPCORD Thank you.
SCARLETT That's what you're saying, not what I'm saying.
RIPCORD Okay, what are you saying?
SCARLETT Attraction is an emotion.
SCARLETT Emotions are not based in science.
SCARLETT And if you can't quantify or prove that something exists, well, in my mind...
SCARLETT it doesn't.
RIPCORD Okay, I'll get back to you on that.
RIPCORD And he walks away scratching his head.
RIPCORD Hawk steps in.
RIPCORD Everyone comes to attention.
HAWK Duke, You scored in the top half- percent of all people we've ever tested.
HAWK Rip, well, if we average your scores with Duke's, you pass too.
HAWK Welcome aboard, provisionally.
HAWK But we still need to see if you pass muster in the field.
HAWK Hawk gives them a nod.
HAWK Duke and rip nod back with pride.
HEAVY DUTY YO JOE!
HEAVY DUTY Welcome aboard, boyz!
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT Ana, Storm Shadow and the Neo-Vipers creep down the hallway.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT Two GI JOE GUARDS come around a corner, before they can even react, Storm Shadow practically cuts them in two with his Katana sword.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT Ana Directs them down another hallway.
A DOOR reads, "General Hawk".
Cover Girl walks up and knocks.
As she waits, we see a SHADOW moving behind her.
Hawk opens the door.
She hands him her POWERBOOK and a
COVER GIRL Sorry to disturb you, general.
HAWK That's all right, Cover Girl.
HAWK What am I signing now?
HAWK Cover Girl GASPS, a KATANA BLADE piercing out through her chest.
HAWK She drops lifelessly, revealing Storm Shadow behind her.
HAWK Hawk grabs a PISTOL, but Storm Shadow flashes his two swords.
HAWK One slices the barrel of the pistol clean off, the other buries itself in Hawk's gut.
HAWK Hawk collapses.
HAWK Ana steps forward and rips the General's SECURITY BADGE off his jacket.
HAWK Hawk's eyes follow them as they leave.
HAWK He glances at a RED BUTTON under his desk and struggles to reach it, giving everything he's got, until he finally hits the button.
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT A KLAXON BLARES.
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT Duke, Ripcord and all the Joes leap up.
DUKE The warheads.
DUKE They all rush out of the doors.
DUKE Breaker stops to change a chess piece on the board before racing out.
Ana swipes Hawk's SECURITY BADGE across the lock of the VAULT DOOR.
It opens.
The weapons case sits on a table.
She opens the case to check that the four warheads are inside, they shine on her glasses.
Duke and Ripcord reach the main vault, armed only with their pistols.
They find the INNER VAULT DOOR ajar.
They approach, pushing back the door to discover that the place is empty and the weapons case is gone.
DUKE They can't be far.
Some of the Neo-Vipers now reach the MOLE PODS and begin prepping them for escape.
BOOM!
A GRENADE slams into them, killing them and destroying the pods.
It's Heavy Duty with his "MPL".
Ana enters the room and quick-draws her PULSE PISTOL and blasts away.
Heavy Duty dives behind cover, which is blown away, knocking him out cold.
Storm Shadow examines the ruined MOLE PODS, glancing around, his eyes falling on a pair of "ARCLIGHT" JET PACKS mounted on a wall rack nearby.
Storm Shadow strides to the nearest one and puts it on.
Ana heads after him, still carrying the case.
Suddenly, Duke and Ripcord rush up behind them, guns raised.
DUKE Put the case down, Ana, Rip trains his gun on Storm Shadow.
RIPCORD And you get out of that...thing.
RIPCORD Stalemate.
RIPCORD Storm Shadow doesn't move.
RIPCORD Ana turns and looks at Duke.
RIPCORD Sets the case down, her voice is gentle.
ANA Fine.
ANA Done.
ANA Then she takes a step toward Duke.
DUKE Stop, Ana.
DUKE Stop right there.
DUKE But she doesn't.
DUKE She just keeps slowly moving toward him.
ANA You can't shoot me, can you?
DUKE I will if I have to.
ANA Deep down, you're still the same man I fell in love with.
DUKE Don't force this, Ana.
ANA What could have been, right, Duke?
ANA You beside your best man.
ANA Me walking down the aisle.
RIPCORD Don't listen to her, Duke.
RIPCORD Was I really going to be your best man?
DUKE Don't make me do this god-damnit!
ANA "Don't make me do this?" A recurring theme in your life, right Duke?
ANA She takes another step.
ANA Duke levels his pistol right at her forehead.
ANA Storm Shadow flinches.
ANA Duke gives him a glance.
DUKE Move and I'll blow her away.
DUKE Get the briefcase.
DUKE Ana takes another step forward, daring Duke to pull the trigger.
DUKE Ripcord, gun drawn and fixed on Storm Shadow, moves slowly forward to retrieve the briefcase.
DUKE Ana is now an inch from the extended barrel.
DUKE Ana and Duke are close enough to feel each other's breath.
DUKE Their eyes lock.
ANA Do it, Duke.
ANA .You already killed me once.
ANA And in Duke's eyes we see him falter, just a bit.
ANA Ripcord passes Ana, and wit hone lightning quick hand she slaps at Duke's pistol.
ANA AN ERRANT SHOT GOES OFF.
ANA Storm Shadow lunges at ripcord, SLICING his pistol in half with one sword and about to kill him with the other.
ANA When suddenly, Snake-Eyes lunges INTO FRAME.
ANA CLANG!
ANA Snake- Eyes' KATANA BLADE saves Ripcord's life by a half inch.
ANA The rest of the Neo-Vipers arrive and immediately open fire, pinning both Duke and Ripcord down.
ANA All hell breaks loose.
ANA Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow lunge at one another, swords flashing at impossible speeds, then they lock swords.
ANA Face- to-face, staring hard into each other's eyes.
Snake-Eyes glances at Storm Shadow's right forearm, spotting the same RED MARKINGS of his ninja clan underneath his suit sleeve.
This shocks the hell out of Snake-Eyes.
Storm Shadow smiles.
Hello brother.
Snake-Eyes looks shocked.
Storm Shadow uses the moment to elbow him in the face, knocking him hard to the ground.
Ana grabs the weapons case as Scarlett rushes in, aiming her
SCARLETT I believe you've got my luggage.
SCARLETT Ana stares at Scarlett, then quick-draws a PULSE PISTOL.
SCARLETT Her shot tears the CROSSBOW PISTOL out of Scarlett's hands.
SCARLETT Ana's got her dead-to-rights until Scarlett triggers her CAMO- SUIT, melting into nothing right in front of Ana.
SCARLETT Ana doesn't spot the RIPPLES OF AIR around her until she's stuck hard.
SCARLETT The case goes flying.
SCARLETT Another SMACK and her pistol is knocked free.
SCARLETT Ana grabs a second pistol, but that's just as quickly twisted out of her grasp and dropped.
SCARLETT Ana fights the invisible Scarlett as best she can, but Scarlett lands several unseen blows on her.
SCARLETT Ripcord and Duke take out a pair of Neo-Vipers.
SCARLETT Storm Shadow climbs back into the Arclight.
SCARLETT Looking at ana as she falls near a vehicle on the blocks.
SCARLETT Ana grabs an OIL PAN and flings the oil, which sprays over everything, including Scarlett, making her visible.
SCARLETT Ana leaps on Scarlett, knocks her to the ground and angrily begins to choke the life out of her.
SCARLETT Storm Shadow ignites the Arclight which jumps into the air, powered by an arc of blue light shooting out of its engine pack.
SCARLETT He quickly swoops towards the two women and grabs ana by her arm, pulling her along.
SCARLETT Ana grabs the weapons case and they soar up out of the motor pool and over the landing pad.
SCARLETT The battle raging below them.
SCARLETT Ripcord and Duke fire after them, but they vanish up into the next level.
SCARLETT Heavy Duty, now back in action, takes out the last of the Neo-Vipers.
SCARLETT Snake-Eyes checks on Scarlett who's nursing her neck.
Ana climbs to Storm Shadow as the rocket up to the SECURITY ROOM WINDOW and BLAST it out of their way.
SHATTER CITY.
INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT They fly into the security room and quickly dispatch the few technicians still alive.
INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT Ana his the large switch on the console and the huge door begins to spiral open.
INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT She jumps back into Storm Shadow's arms and they blast back out--
--and fly up through the hole where their Typhoon gunship rockets up.
They fly in through a door as four Joe ANTI- AIRCRAFT TURRETS spring out of the sand, firing away at the Typhoon as it speeds away into the dark desert night...
Dawn light shimmers across the reflecting pool, the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument.
The AMERICAN PRESIDENT quickly but quietly closes the door to his bedroom, throwing on a robe, he charges down a corridor, trailed by his STAFF and BODYGUARDS.
One of the staffers hands the President a report which he skims through.
PRESIDENT How many warheads?
STAFFER #1 Four, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT Any threats?
PRESIDENT Any demands?
STAFFER #1 None so far, sir.
We take this to mean the terrorists are unfocused, no clear goals.
The President stops, glancing gravely back at his staff.
PRESIDENT No, .it means they're going to use them.

MCCULLEN (CONT'D) As I have never forgotten what the French did to Clan McCullen.
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY In the shadowy operating chamber, the Doctor approaches Zartan who sits on a gurney, scanning his PDA.
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY Dozens of SMART ROBOTS warm up as the Doctor flicks on switches.
THE DOCTOR Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?
ZARTAN This is going to be the achievement of a lifetime.
THE DOCTOR For you and me both.
ZARTAN Eighteen months of studying the subject, learning the mannerisms, adopting his eating habits, losing sixty percent of my muscle mas...
THE DOCTOR Your commitment has been inspiring.
THE DOCTOR McCullen enters.
MCCULLEN Gentlemen.
MCCULLEN About to get under way?
MCCULLEN Zartan raises his PDA.
ZARTAN Once the ledgers are all square.
MCCULLEN Check your account.
MCCULLEN Zartan checks the PDA.
MCCULLEN McCullen shakes his head.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) It's always about the money.
ZARTAN It's a useful tool.
ZARTAN You should understand that.
ZARTAN Ah!
ZARTAN The transfer just hit my account.
ZARTAN Zartan puts the PDA aside, leans back on the gurney and
Let's do this.
The Doctor straps Zartan down, then starts the SMART ROBOTS which converge on Zartan, injecting his body with dozens of long needles.
He remains conscious, not feeling any pain.
WE ZOOM into a LARGE NEEDLE which OPENS an INCISION behind his right ear.
The needle feeds thousands of tiny NANO-MITES into Zartan's head.
Zartan's eyes bulge, he starts to SCREAM and fight his restraints as the nano-mites begin to reshape his appearance, reforming facial bones and changing the texture and elasticity of his skin and even changing the color of his eyes.
The Doctor grins proudly.
McCullen looks disturbed.
Joes are busy cleaning up the mess.
Snake-Eyes sits by himself, hasn't moved in several hours.
A thousand yard stare in his eyes.
AND WE FLASHBACK TO:
A TEN YEAR OLD FRENCH ORPHAN BOY, cold from the rain and desperately hungry, scavenges for food in a garbage can, he looks up and notices a warm light coming from the other side of a wall and gate MARKED WITH RED CLAN MARKINGS.
INSIDE THE TEMPLE: Young Snake Eyes sneaks in through the Kitchen window and goes to a rice pot on the counter.
As he takes a first bite, another young boy enters, we see the RED CLAN MARKINGS on his forearm, it's a young Storm Shadow, healthy, wealthy, and well fed.
YOUNG STORM SHADOW Thief !
YOUNG STORM SHADOW He picks up the KITCHEN KNIFE and tries to cut Young Snake- Eyes, who blocks the strike with the rice pot.
YOUNG STORM SHADOW They fight fiercely for two little kids, using all sorts of utensils and furniture.
YOUNG STORM SHADOW Snake-Eyes has desperate street skills, but Storm Shadow's classic training gives him the edge.
YOUNG STORM SHADOW He finally traps Snake-Eyes under his foot, a triumphant look on his face.
YOUNG STORM SHADOW He starts to choke Snake-Eyes with his foot ...
HARD MASTER Enough!
HARD MASTER Storm Shadow!
HARD MASTER A Ninja Master steps forward.
HARD MASTER Storm Shadow turns to him.
YOUNG STORM SHADOW Father, he was stealing.
YOUNG STORM SHADOW We need to call the magistrate.
HARD MASTER He is hungry.
HARD MASTER We need to invite him in and show him the way.
STORM SHADOW He's a cur!
STORM SHADOW A Frenchie!
HARD MASTER He doesn't fight like one.
HARD MASTER The two young warriors glare at one another.
Now what shall be your clan name?
Snake-Eyes glares up at Storm Shadow, narrowing his eyes furiously.
Hard Master just smiles, AHl AND WE FLASH BACK TO: Snake-Eyes in the motor pool, he stands up and walk off...
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT Battered and bruised, Scarlett hurriedly enters the barracks.
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT Checks around to see that she's alone.
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT Then she heads for a mirror over one of the sinks, peeling back her collar to check the CHOKE MARKS on her neck.
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT Her hands are trembling.
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT She turns on the water and cleans her face with a WASH CLOTH.
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT Ripcord enters the barracks behind.
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT Like Scarlett, he looks around to see if he's alone.
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT He catches Scarlett looking at him in the mirror, as if he's unwanted.
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT Then he notices the choke marks.
INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT He is genuinely concerned.
RIPCORD Jesus, you okay?
SCARLETT I'm fine.
RIPCORD You're not fine, let me look at that.
SCARLETT I looked at it, it's fine.
RIPCORD Take it easy, just trying to help.
SCARLETT I know what you're trying to do.
RIPCORD And what is that exactly?
SCARLETT I don't have time for this.
RIPCORD You know, not every guy you meet is an asshole.
RIPCORD You do know that, don't you?
RIPCORD Scarlett stops and returns to the sink, he ignores her, cleaning the blood off his face.
RIPCORD She softens.
SCARLETT It's not you, I...
SCARLETT I didn't really want anyone to...
SCARLETT see me in here.
RIPCORD Why not?
SCARLETT I don't know.
SCARLETT All the people we lost last night.
SCARLETT General Hawk...
SCARLETT My neck is not that important.
RIPCORD You almost died.
RIPCORD You're allowed to be concerned.
SCARLETT First fight I've lost since I was a kid.
SCARLETT My father would be...
SCARLETT he was my instructor.
RIPCORD Think he's be disappointed.
SCARLETT He taught me to win.
RIPCORD I don't know how you teach anybody to win at everything every time.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) But I do know you can teach someone to get up when they get knocked down.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Ripcord turn her gently in the mirror.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Look at you.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Still here.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Maybe this is what he wanted you to learn.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Scarlett stares at her reflection briefly.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) But of course, that would be an emotional response, one that can't be explained or quantified.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Ripcord turns and heads for the door.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Scarlett watches him.
SCARLETT We're not a couple.
SCARLETT Snake-Eyes and me.
SCARLETT We're...
SCARLETT close, he's like a brother, but...
SCARLETT we're not a couple.
SCARLETT Ripcord looks back at her, nods, then walks on out.
Hawk is hooked up to a LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE.
Duke sits nearby, his shoulder being bandaged by a Medical Officer.
WE PUSH IN ON Duke's eyes, staring into oblivion, AND FLASHBACK
HAWK Can you kill her?
HAWK And then WE FLASHBACK TO: Ana strangling Scarlett, a smile on her face.
HAWK Squeezing harder, harder.
HAWK Pure evil.
That ought to hold you.
Duke "comes to" as the Doctor finishes and walks away.
Duke takes a breath, looks to Hawk in his bed, then stands and walks over.
He stares down at Hawk, then, a promise--
DUKE Graveyard dead.
Duke, Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Heavy Duty stare at some next-gen computerized ultra-sound PHOTOSTATS of a dead Neo-Viper.
Snake-Eyes points in question to an area.
SCARLETT Nano-mites.
SCARLETT I wrote my thesis on the theory behind them at Oxford.
SCARLETT They've been surgically implanted behind the ear, all programmed to accomplish different tasks.
DUKE Like what?
SCARLETT Theoretically, the possibilities are endless.
SCARLETT Increase their speed, agility, resilience.
SCARLETT You program, they perform.
SCARLETT That's the genius of nanotechnology, it can do pretty much whatever you want it to.
DUKE Mind control?
SCARLETT I don't see why not.
Duke and Ripcord move with the others through a corridor.
DUKE Their weaponry, financing, intel, it has to be McCullen.
DUKE Doing an inside job on his own warheads.
SCARLETT You may be right.
SCARLETT Maybe he needed NATO to pay for his R D.
RIPCORD The weapons case!
RIPCORD Everyone stops and looks at Ripcord like he's nuts.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Remember he had us open the case for him.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Remember that?
SCARLETT What about it?
RIPCORD I'll bet that code he gave us like re-activated the tracking beacon or something.
RIPCORD Looks pass among the group, it starts to make sense.
DUKE And who says you're not a thinker.
DUKE All of the sudden, Breaker rushes up to them, out of breath.
BREAKER I think I found her...
INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY Breaker leads the group into the control room where a WEDDING PHOTO OF ANA AND DeCobray is up on screen.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY Duke stares at the photo, gazing at her face.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY Ripcord sees her and knows, too.
DUKE Yeah, you found her all right.
BREAKER Her name is Ana DeCobray now, Baroness if you're feeling formal.
RIPCORD Wow, she traded up, huh?
RIPCORD I mean...
RIPCORD financially.
DUKE Who is he?
BREAKER Baron DeCobray.
BREAKER Big shot French scientist.
BREAKER Runs a lab in Paris.
SCARLETT Lab?
SCARLETT Breaker call up an image of DeCobray standing in front of a huge PARTICLE ACCELERATOR along with some other scientists.
BREAKER Particle accelerator.
SCARLETT They're gonna use him to weaponize the warheads.
DUKE That's where she's going.
HEAVY DUTY Who likes croissants?
And then a lighted aircraft in the distance approaches at Mach three.
It's the Howler.
The Joes are silent, eyes ahead.
Scarlett shares a smile with Ripcord, next to her, Across from them Duke watches, almost smiles, then lays back his head and closes his eyes.
AND WE
CAMERA PANS AROUND a village choked by thick jungle as EXPLOSIONS erupt in SLO-MO and a BLACKHAWK circles, ROTORS beating hypnotically, giving the images a dreamlike quality.
Duke, Ripcord, Rex, and the rest of an insertion team, sit with their backs against the chopper walls.
DUKE Per the briefing, we fast rope in, form up and assault the main lab...
DUKE Rex--uh, .the science officer, stays back with Fireteam Alpha until Bravo enters and secures the building.
DUKE Alpha holds the perimeter while science officer secures the WMDs.
DUKE Five minutes before extraction and the airstrike.
DUKE The squad nods.
DUKE Duke looks to Rex again.
DUKE Rex is sweating, trying not to show it.
DUKE Duke hands him a piece of gum.
DUKE (CONT'D) Double Bubble?
DUKE (CONT'D) Rex takes it.
DUKE (CONT'D) Duke blows a bubble, smiles at Rex.
DUKE (CONT'D) Always helps me.
DUKE (CONT'D) You good?
REX Yeah...
REX They chew their gum.
DOWN IN THE VILLAGE: Duke leads a frontal assault of the main building.
They take fire from some GUARDS, but put them down.
Other GUARDS flee.
The way to the door is cleared.
Duke gives hand signals along with his commands.
DUKE Go, Bravo.
DUKE Bravo, a TWO-MAN fire team hit the door of the building.
DUKE They disappear inside.
DUKE Rex, a kit bag over his shoulder and a .45 Colt ACP on his hip, waits in a crouch, Duke next to him puts a hand on his shoulder.
DUKE Duke scans the treeline for any treats.
DUKE One of Bravo Team appears in the doorway and signals "ALL CLEAR."
DUKE Duke double taps Rex on the shoulder.
DUKE (CONT'D) You're good to go, Rex.
DUKE (CONT'D) You don't find it in four minutes, get out of there, because that house won't be standing in five.
DUKE (CONT'D) I already called for the air strike.
DUKE (CONT'D) Rex nods.
DUKE (CONT'D) Duke gives him a smile.
DUKE (CONT'D) Rex takes off and runs low to the door, entering the house.
DUKE (CONT'D) Duke watches him go, then looks back to the jungle and hears the WHUMP of mortars.
DUKE (CONT'D) Duke takes one more look, Rex disappears safely inside, then the mortar rounds start to hit.
DUKE (CONT'D) The ground is torn apart, dirt flying in the air, as Duke, Rip and the rest of the squad takes cover.
DUKE (CONT'D) We catch glimpses of the enemy, lots of them, in the jungle, firing.
DUKE (CONT'D) Duke and Ripcord pop up and return fire.
RIPCORD I've gotta level with ya!
DUKE I hate it when you level with me.
RIPCORD Gonna be a long five minutes.
RIPCORD Duke just grits his teeth and keeps firing.
RIPCORD Then, in the distance, RUMBLING coming from the sonic roar of JETS.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) I love that sound...
RIPCORD (CONT'D) But then he looks to Duke, confusion on his face.
DUKE No, no, no...
DUKE It's too soon.
DUKE ANGLE ON: The F-16s in formation streaking toward them across the sky.
DUKE Duke looks back at the main building.
DUKE (CONT'D) Rex.
DUKE (CONT'D) Duke runs for the building.
DUKE (CONT'D) Tracer fire and mortar explosions all around him.
DUKE (CONT'D) Then the whistle of a bunker buster.
DUKE (CONT'D) Duke dives and BOOM!
DUKE (CONT'D) The building is flattened by the bomb.
DUKE (CONT'D) Duke is tossed through the air like a rag doll.
DUKE (CONT'D) Lands hard, barely registers the pain, staggers up, bloody and ripped, stumbles toward the smoking.
DUKE (CONT'D) Flaming rubble that was the building.
DUKE (CONT'D) The Blackhawk comes sweeping low, ready for extraction, the tracer fire and explosions intensify.
DUKE (CONT'D) Black smoke washes over Duke.
DUKE (CONT'D) Ripcord finds him in the debris.
RIPCORD Blackhawk's waiting.
RIPCORD Come on, we've got wounded!
RIPCORD And incoming enemy!
RIPCORD Lots of 'em!
DUKE I can't.
RIPCORD Nothing you can do.
RIPCORD Come on...!
RIPCORD Gunfire bursts around them as Ripcord pulls Duke away from the ruins of the house.
TIGHT ON Duke's haunted, soot-streaked face as his eyes take on a thousand-yard stare.
AND WE CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT:
Duke is wide awake, his eyes have on a thousand-yard stare...
Paris by day, the Eiffel Tower in all her glory.
Ana's SCARAB ATTACK TRUCK pulls up to a GUARD SHED outside a large building which is surrounded by an ELECTRIFIED FENCE.
A SECURITY GUARD steps out of the shed and taps on the driver's window.
The Neo-Viper behind the wheel lowers the BACKSEAT WINDOW, revealing Ana and Storm Shadow in the back.
The guard smiles at Ana.
They speak in French, subtitled.
SECURITY GUARD Good Morning.
SECURITY GUARD Baroness.
ANA Good morning.
ANA Gene.
ANA My husband's expecting me.
SECURITY GUARD Absolument.
SECURITY GUARD The Security Guard opens the ELECTRONIC GATE and the Scarab drives up to the building.
Two SECURITY GUARDS look up from their desks as Ana and Storm Shadow stride through the DOORS with two Neo-Vipers.
Storm Shadow throws something.
Both guards fall dead.
THROWING STARS in their heads.
The Neo-Vipers steal behind the desk, throw a switch, open a LOCKED DOOR for Ana and Storm Shadow.
INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY Ana and Storm Shadow enter a colossal chamber which is all but consumed by the PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.
LAB TECHNICIANS swarm all over it, taking readings and making adjustments, under the eyes of DeCobray who sits at a control station surrounded by monitors.
Ana gives the weapons case to Storm Shadow who hangs back as she walks up to her husband.
DECOBRAY Ana...?
ANA I need you to do something for me and I don't have much time.
DECOBRAY Who is this?
DECOBRAY She beckons Storm Shadow who sets the weapons case down on DeCobray's desk, opening it up to reveal the four NANOTECH WARHEADS and their launchers.
DECOBRAY DeCobray stares, bewildered.
DECOBRAY (CONT'D) I don't understand...
DECOBRAY (CONT'D) what are these things?
DECOBRAY (CONT'D) What's going on?
ANA They're warheads, dear.
ANA And I need you to weaponize them for me...
ANA .or we'll kill everyone in here.
ANA DeCobray stares at her, shocked.
ANA He looks at Storm Shadow who removes a GLOCK PISTOL from his belt and shoots a TECHNICIAN.
ANA Chaos erupts.
ANA DeCobray shouts to the room, calming the others somewhat.
ANA He stares at Ana and Storm Shadow, terrified.
DECOBRAY This is a civilian laboratory.
DECOBRAY We don't have the correct programming protocols for weaponizing...
ANA The protocols are in the case.
ANA I told you, I don't have much time.
ANA DeCobray reluctantly takes the weapons case.
A BRAWLER charges through the streets.
On the outside it looks like your Uncle's R.V, but inside it's all next-gen.
Heavy Duty drives the Brawler while Breaker mans a hi-tech terminal next to him.
In the back, Snake-Eyes loads his guns while Scarlett, Duke, and Ripcord put on ACCELERATOR SUITS.
SCARLETT Heavy D and Breaker will stay in the Brawler, watch our back.
SCARLETT The rest of us will break into the lab with the accelerator suits.
SCARLETT Once the warheads are weaponized, they'll be extremely volatile.
SCARLETT We can't afford to let any of them go off inside the city.
SCARLETT Ripcord looks at Snake-Eyes.
RIPCORD What about you?
RIPCORD Don't you get a suit?
RIPCORD Snake-Eyes just looks at him, "Are you kidding me?"
SCARLETT He doesn't need one.
INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY A TREMENDOUS WHINE echoes through the chamber as the particle accelerator come to life, HUMMING evenly.
INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY Storm Shadow backs up a little.
INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY Ana glances at him.
INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY He shrugs, what?
INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY Technicians quickly finish up and back away from the accelerator.
DECOBRAY Firing.
DECOBRAY DeCobray hits a switch.
DECOBRAY The PARTICLE ACCELERATOR charges and begins hurling atoms through miles and miles of underground tunnels.
DECOBRAY Inside the accelerator, the four warheads begin to spin in a GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER -- then, as the power grows, they begin to rise, each one hovering as they spin.
DECOBRAY Ana and Storm Shadow watch with mild curiosity as the noise inside the chamber builds.
DECOBRAY The atoms catapulting faster and faster through the tunnels, bombarding the warheads again and again.
DECOBRAY Until finally, a LOUD BOOM rings out.
DECOBRAY And the warheads slowly sink back down and stop spinning.
DECOBRAY DeCobray keys another button and the GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER emerges from the accelerator.
Technicians open the chamber and very carefully remove the warheads, returning them to their case.
Storm Shadow locks the case and picks it up.
DECOBRAY (CONT'D) Careful...
DECOBRAY (CONT'D) they're alive.
ANA Thank you, Leon.
DECOBRAY I think I have never seen the face of evil until I looked at you now.
DECOBRAY Ana looks at him and falters, something in his words piercing her hard veneer.
DECOBRAY She feels Storm Shadow watching her and with a flick of her eyes, the walls go up again.
DECOBRAY She drop a SEALED ENVELOPE on DeCobray's desk and heads for the door.
ANA Adieu.
ANA DeCobray watches her go, then opens the envelope.
ANA We see the LARGE HEADER printed on the first page: "ACCORD DE DIVORCE".
The Brawler races up towards the lab, they see it out their forward windows.
HEAVY DUTY There it is.
Ana and Storm Shadow emerge from the lab and climb into the back of the Scarab as the two Neo-Vipers climb in the front.
DeCobray stumbles out to the foyer, finds the two Security Guards dead, and quickly picks up a phone.
The Security Guard in the guard shed puts down his phone and glances at the oncoming Scarab just as a Neo-Viper leans out with his PULSE RIFLE and blasts the whole shed to pieces.
The Scarab crashes right out the gate.
At the same time, the Brawler reaches the laboratory and there's a split second where both sides see each other in their windows.
Duke and Ana lock eyes.
Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow do the same.
BREAKER That's them!
BREAKER Snake-Eyes is already moving, lunging out a SIDE DOOR onto the street as the Brawler still moves, running right at the Scarab which turns to get away.
BREAKER Scarlett immediately follows him out, landing in a roll with her accelerator suit.
BREAKER Ana leans out of her window and fires her PULSE PISTOLS at the Brawler, keeping Duke and Rip inside.
BREAKER Then she fires at Snake-Eyes and Scarlett.
BREAKER Snake-Eyes dives, but the blasts nail Scarlett.
BREAKER She crashes hard.
BREAKER Snake-Eyes glances at her.
SCARLETT Keep going!
SCARLETT With that, he leaps after the Scarab, just grabbing the back of the vehicle as it tears away.
SCARLETT The Brawler stops right next to Scarlett, out of breath, her accelerator suit
SCARLETT (CONT'D) Don't worry about me, go and help Snake-Eyes!
SCARLETT (CONT'D) Duke doesn't need to be told twice.
SCARLETT (CONT'D) He leaps out and runs after the Scarab.
SCARLETT (CONT'D) Rips starts to follow, Breaker grabs him.
BREAKER Careful.
BREAKER They're worth millions of dollars...
BREAKER each.
RIPCORD Millions of dollars, got it.
RIPCORD He promptly trips and crashes to the pavement.
RIPCORD Picks himself up.
RIPCORD Gets hit by a car.
RIPCORD Picks himself up again.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Sorry!
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Excusem moil
RIPCORD (CONT'D) Won't happen again.
Then Rip hauls-ass after Duke.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY An ACCORDIAN BUS passes casually through an intersection.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY All of a sudden, the Scarab bursts through it, ripping it in two and barrelling on down the busy street.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY Snake-Eyes is still barely clinging to the back.
INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY Breaker watches the two halves of the bus whirl around on his SATELLITE VIEW as Heavy Duty drives through the city streets.
BREAKER Christ, they just shot right through a bus!
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY Duke and Rip charge after the Scarab.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY Their speedometers reading 15mph...then 30mph...then 40mph.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY they leap over and around speeding cars and trucks.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY The Scarab smashes through any vehicle in its path, leaving a trail of destruction for Duke and Ripcord to leap over or dart around in their suits.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY Ana and Storm Shadow hear Snake- Eyes on the roof and drop their windows and lean out and shoot at him.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY But Snake-Eyes quickly clambers down the side of the vehicle, escaping their shots by disappearing beneath the undercarriage.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY And that's when Ana sees Duke and Rip following.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY She sits back down inside and keys a button on a console.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY SIDE PANELS slide open on the outside of the Scarab to reveal two MISSILES, one on each side.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY They fire.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY The MISSILES streak back towards Duke and Ripcord.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY No time to get out of the way, they dive and roll in various directions, extreme kinetic energy hurling them forward.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY The two missiles whip between them and detonate, one on a PARKING OFFICER'S CAR and the other on a BILLBOARD.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY The EXPLOSION from the car knocks them down.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY The Scarab tears away around a corner.
INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY They see Snake-Eyes on their monitors in the Brawler.
BREAKER They're turning the corner.
BREAKER Go through that building at 6 o'clock!
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY Duke and Ripcord see the building in front of them.
RIPCORD There's no door!
BREAKER'S VOICE Make one!
BREAKER'S VOICE Duke charges directly at the building.
BREAKER'S VOICE Ripcord reluctantly following as Duke smashes through the wall into...
A crowded bar.
Neither of them slow for a second.
Duke bolts through.
Rip grabs a MARTINI, opens his visor, downs the drink, then places the empty glass on the tray of a stunned waitress.
Behind her a sign reads: "DRINK RESPONSIBLY".
Duke and Ripcord SMASH through the opposite wall...
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY .back out onto the city streets where they turn and level their WRIST-MOUNTED ROCKETS at...nothing.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY A puzzling beat.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY And then the Scarab thunders up behind them at full speed.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY Ripcord dives out of the way just in time.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY Duke has no such luck.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY He spins and catches the FRONT GRILL, digging his feet into the road in an attempt to slow the Scarab down.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY But the Scarab now angles towards a busy intersection, threatening to crush DUKE in the criss-crossing traffic.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY Duke throws himself onto the hood just as an SUV CRASHES into the front grill and is chucked away like so much garbage.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY Duke tumbles up onto the roof.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY A PULSE CANNON pops up.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY Duke dives off the back as the weapon fires.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY He tumbles to the pavement as Ripcord speeds up to him, firing his WRIST- MOUNTED ROCKETS at the Scarab.
EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY Duke fires with him.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY Their rockets nail the Scarab and knock out the PULSE CANNON.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY BOOM!
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY But its armor saves the vehicle.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY INSIDE: Storm Shadow and Ana are knocked around.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY Storm Shadow pops a hatch and grabs one of their own ACCELERATOR SUITS.
INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY Hands it to Ana.
STORM SHADOW Mr. McCullen would be quite unhappy if I let you die.
STORM SHADOW Ana quickly and nervously starts to buckle in.
ANA How thoughtful.
On the monitors, Scarlett and Breaker watch the Scarab via Snake-Eyes speeding through the streets.
SCARLETT Look at the moves they're making, they're heading somewhere.
SCARLETT Breaker widens the map, plotting a route.
BREAKER This's their route from the lab.
BREAKER On the screen, they see the lab, the current position of the Scarab, and what lies just ahead.
BREAKER .the Eiffel Tower.
Metal...
Oh God...
Snake-Eyes is now desperately clinging to the undercarriage.
Duke and Rip are catching up behind him.
SCARLETT'S VOICE Guys, you have to stop them.
DUKE Yeah, we're working on it.
SCARLETT'S VOICE I mean right now.
SCARLETT'S VOICE They're going to detonate one of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower.
SCARLETT'S VOICE Ripcord glances up and sees the Eiffel Tower looming up fast.
RIPCORD Oh, man...
RIPCORD Under the Scarab, Snake-Eyes pulls out his GLOCK PISTOL and fires into the unprotected insides of the FRONT TIRES, which promptly rip to shreds.
RIPCORD The Neo-Viper loses control of the vehicle, SMASHES through a GUARD ARM onto train tracks.
RIPCORD Snake-Eyes sees something, lets go, rolls free and crashes into garbage cans just as a METRO TRAIN barrels into the Scarab, which LAUNCHES into the air, hood-over-tailpipe.
RIPCORD Duke and Ripcord are running too fast to stop.
RIPCORD Duke manages to leap into the air, his boots barely scraping the top of the train while Ripcord covers his face with his hands and PLUNGES headlong into a window on the side of the train...
.flying across the aisle, whipping past a group of stunned morning COMMUTERS, and smashing out through the far window...
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY The Scarab, Duke and Rip all CRASH HARD to the pavement and tumble.
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY Sparks and flame and flying metal everywhere.
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY Duke and Rip finally stop tumbling, a hundred yards away from the wreck of the Scarab.
INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY Scarlett, Heavy Duty and Breaker see this on their monitors.
Holy shit...
You guys okay?
Duke and Ripcord's visors lift, both looking a bit wigged.
DUKE What happened to you?
RIPCORD I went through the train.
RIPCORD What happened to you?
DUKE I jumped over it.
RIPCORD You can do that?
DUKE Yeah, you didn't know?
DUKE INSIDE THE SCARAB: We see the Neo-Vipers are dead.
DUKE Storm Shadow is incredibly beat and bloody, but Ana is just fine in her red Accelerator Suit.
DUKE Storm Shadow grabs the weapons case and he and Ana leap out.
DUKE Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls out of the TRASH CANS nearby.
DUKE They see Storm Shadow and Ana emerge from the Scarab and hurry off towards the tower.
DUKE (CONT'D) C'mon!
DUKE (CONT'D) Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord, charging after them.
HUNDREDS OF TOURISTS swarm around the south base of the tower to buy their tickets and start their tours.
Storm Shadow and Ana burst through them, slamming past SECURITY GUARDS as they bound onto the stairs.
People scream at the sight of Ana.
Duke and Ripcord arrive seconds later, rushing up in their Accelerator Suits like beings from another world.
They spot Ana and Storm Shadow on the stairs and hurry after them.
The Security Guards draw their pistols and start SHOOTING at Duke and Ripcord.
The BULLETS ping off their suits.
RIPCORD How do you say "we're the good guys" in French?
RIPCORD Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up under the south base, scaling the iron lattice like a monkey.
ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow crest the stairs and rudely push through the crowd to the stairway on the opposite side of the floor.
Another SECURITY GUARD draws a gun on them but Storm Shadow snatches the weapon out of the man's hands, swatting him with the butt, all without missing a step.
The crowd panics and runs screaming for the stairs-- --where Duke and Ripcord are struggling to catch up.
The avalanche of tourists slows their progress.
Underneath the stairway, however, Snake-Eyes continues to climb fast without a safety net.
He makes it to the first floor and races after Ana and Storm Shadow.
ON THE GROUND: The Brawler screeches up.
Scarlett's first out with Breaker and Heavy Duty behind her.
All of them carrying weapons.
The Security Guards instantly go on the defensive as they hurry up to the stairway.
Guns go up.
Scarlett speaks to them urgently in French.
SCARLETT Don't shoot!
SCARLETT We're a special anti- terrorist unit!
SCARLETT There's a bomb up there!
SCARLETT POLICE CARS are now rushing up behind them.
SCARLETT ON THE SECOND FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow speed over to the main tower ELEVATOR and barge their way inside.
SCARLETT Storm Shadow hurls the ELEVATOR OPERATOR out as Ana opens the weapons case and removes one of the NANOTECH WARHEADS and its KILL SWITCH.
SCARLETT Through the stunned crowd, they see Snake-Eyes reach the top of the stairs behind.
SCARLETT Ana rolls the warhead towards him while Storm Shadow lines up on him with the Security Guard's pistol as if to shoot him.
SCARLETT Snake-Eyes glares defiantly at Storm Shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the warhead.
SCARLETT A SINGLE SHOT AND THE WARHEAD EXPLODES.
SCARLETT Snake-Eyes recoils.
SCARLETT ON THE GROUND: Everyone hears the warhead detonate.
SCARLETT ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Duke and Ripcord freeze.
SCARLETT ON THE SECOND FLOOR: A BURST OF NANO-MITES spreads out in all directions.
SCARLETT Storm Shadow closes the ELEVATOR DOORS and hits a button for the top.
SCARLETT The elevator races upwards as everything else gets eaten by the ravenous NANO-MITES.
SCARLETT The floor begins to disappear.
SCARLETT Tourists stampede towards the stairs.
SCARLETT A LITTLE GIRL is thrown from her MOTHER'S GRIP.
SCARLETT The mother screams out for her child as the girl goes over the railing.
ON THE FIRST FLOOR: a hundred feet up, Duke and Rip see her coming.
Ripcord swings out and catches the girl just in time.
Above them, the tower is dissolving before their eyes.
Duke sees Snake-Eyes being pushed down the stairs by the tourists.
He leaps up onto the iron lattice.
RIPCORD Where you going?
DUKE Each warhead has a kill switch.
RIPCORD It's too late!
RIPCORD We gotta get off this thing!
DUKE Those nano-mites will level the entire city!
DUKE Duke climbs up the side of the tower with his Accelerator Suit.
DUKE Rip things about following, but then looks at the little girl in his arms, who smiles and hugs him.
DUKE Snake-Eyes grabs him and they join the flow of people down the stairs.
DUKE The NANO-MITES chasing them close behind.
DUKE Below them, Scarlett, Breaker, and Heavy Duty are helping the police evacuate the Tower.
DUKE INSIDE THE ELEVATOR: Ana and Storm Shadow race to the top.
ANA Be ready to pick up in thirty seconds.
ANA IN THE SKIES: The Typhoon gunship rockets towards the top of the disintegrating Eiffel Tower, its SIDE DOOR opening.
ANA ON THE TOWER: Duke scales the tower, the NANO-MITES chasing him up.
ANA His eyes on the elevator as it reaches the top deck just above him.
ANA The Typhoon fires a blast of its CONCUSSION CANNONS at Duke, knocking him off the tower.
ANA He falls, but manages to catch the tower just below, the NANO-MITES almost on top of him now.
ANA The climbs even faster.
ANA ON THE TOP DECK: The elevator arrives.
ANA Ana and Storm Shadow calmly walk out and climb the railing as the Typhoon hovers up beside them.
ANA Below them, Duke sees them board.
ANA The tower groans and wobbles.
ANA It's a long way down.
ANA Time has run out.
ANA Ana and Storm Shadow jump into the Typhoon.
With the NANO-MITES at his heels, Duke clambers up and jumps up off the side of the Tower, sailing up through the air and latching onto the SIDE DOOR of the Typhoon.
IN THE TYPHOON: The gunship rocks with his sudden weight.
Ana and Storm Shadow almost lose their footing.
Duke springs inside.
He smacks Storm Shadow down and grabs the KILL SWITCH from Ana, pressing the trigger.
Immediately, the NANO-MITES pulse with light and fall to the ground around the Eiffel Tower.
The Tower groans, half-eaten, then topples over on its side.
Ripcord and Snake-Eyes scurry out of the way as it crashes down onto the Seine, sending up an enormous explosion of water.
The shock on the faces of everyone around reverberates through the entire Joe team.
Ripcord keeps his eyes on the Typhoon as it pulls away.
Breaker suddenly gets an idea.
BREAKER Come on!
BREAKER He hauls-ass.
Ana looks at Duke, a pursed smile on her lips.
ANA You just saved Paris.
ANA Storm Shadow is not happy at all, he TASERS Duke, who drops hard to the floor of the Typhoon.
EXT. STREET - DAY A crowd has gathered around the crashed Scarab.
EXT. STREET - DAY Heavy Duty yanks one of the dead Neo-Vipers out.
EXT. STREET - DAY Breaker yanks off the guy's HELMET then removes a needle-like PORT PLUG from his SURVEILLANCE SUIT.
EXT. STREET - DAY Scarlett moves into position to help him.
EXT. STREET - DAY Ripcord kneels down.
RIPCORD What are you doing?
BREAKER Plugging into his cerebral cortex.
BREAKER With a SICKENING CRUNCH, Breaker plunges the needle into the top of the Neo-Viper's head.
BREAKER Ripcord winces at the sight.
SCARLETT The brain survives for a couple of minutes after death.
SCARLETT We can read his most recent memories.
RIPCORD Can you find Duke?
BREAKER If this guy remembers the way home we can.
BREAKER INSERT: A FLASH OF MEMORIES appearing on Breaker's HUD.
BREAKER Duke shooting him in the face, racing along the highway, driving the ARMORED CAR.
BREAKER As the images continue, we PUSH IN
on the Neo-Viper's open eyes and CUT TO:
INT. CONTROL ROOM - MARS HEADQUARTERS - DAY McCullen watching Breaker and Ripcord through the dead Neo- Viper's eyes on a screen.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - MARS HEADQUARTERS - DAY He turns to the Doctor urgently.
MCCULLEN Destroy that unit immediately.
MCCULLEN The Doctor removes his PDA and taps a key to draw up the Neo- Viper's file.
MCCULLEN He clicks a button that reads "TERMINATE".
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY Instantly, the Neo-Viper's body snaps rigid and begins to shake.
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY Everyone gets a shock.
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY Backing up.
HEAVY DUTY He's still alive!
SCARLETT He's not alive.
HEAVY DUTY You ever seen a dead guy do that?
SCARLETT They activated a self-destruct.
SCARLETT The Neo-Viper's body starts to decay before them.
SCARLETT Thousands of NANO-MITES literally eating away at his flesh and bones.
BREAKER Nano-mites!
RIPCORD They're eating him!
SCARLETT Hurry, Breaker!
SCARLETT But the NANO-MITES are too fast.
SCARLETT The Neo-Viper's legs are now gone.
SCARLETT His chest and arms next.
SCARLETT Breaker rapidly scans through the MEMORY FLASHES.
SCARLETT But now the NANO-MITES consume his head.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - MARS HEADQUARTERS - DAY McCullen watches Breaker's frantic face suddenly disappear on his screen.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - MARS HEADQUARTERS - DAY He gives the Doctor a smile.
EXT. STREET - DAY Breaker looks crestfallen at the empty Neo-Viper suit in his arms.
EXT. STREET - DAY Ripcord kneels beside him, stunned and bereft.
RIPCORD You did the best you could.
BREAKER Relax, I got it.
RIPCORD You got it?
Well, what was the "NOO!" for?
BREAKER That was for McCullen.
BREAKER There is the sound of weapons being raised.
BREAKER The team looks to see they are surrounded by FRENCH POLICE and PARATROOPERS.

RIPCORD Heavy, you go for his weapon and--
BREAKER --Start an international incident.
RIPCORD I'm not gonna just sit here!
BREAKER This is bigger than Duke.
RIPCORD What if it was one of you?
RIPCORD What if they had Heavy or Scarlett, what would you do?
RIPCORD The Joes trade looks - rock and a hard place.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) We're not doing Duke a damned bit of good sitting here.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) If it was reversed, Duke would be kicking down every door between here and the freakin' moon 'til he found me.
SCARLETT And we'll do the same for him as soon as we get out of here.
SCARLETT She has a thought and turns to Breaker.
SCARLETT (CONT'D) Partial?
SCARLETT (CONT'D) You said partial latitude and longitude.
BREAKER We only got the one coordinate-- 90 degrees, then the image went to snow.
SCARLETT Maybe it was the whole coordinate, just 90 degrees latitude.
SCARLETT (CONT'D) Before the image went to snow,...it's the polar ice cap.
SCARLETT (CONT'D) RIP'S DOG TAGS hit the floor and slide to his feet.
SCARLETT (CONT'D) The Joes all look up to see several POLICE OFFICIALS looking at them.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT The Joes are led down a hallway.
RIPCORD They did away with the guillotine, right?
RIPCORD They arrive at a door.
RIPCORD The door is opened to reveal a man in a wheelchair, back turned.
RIPCORD When he spins around, it's Hawk.
BREAKER General!
BREAKER Hawk just shakes his head and sighs heavily.
The Joes sit around the General, mid-discussion.
HEAVY DUTY How long before we're released?
HAWK The French government is allowing you to leave on the condition that none of you ever return.
HAWK Other agencies will be handling this from here on.
What?!
HAWK The heads of state of every member of GI JOE are recalling their operatives.
HAWK We are now considered a rogue unit, uncontrollable.
HAWK Shut down.
HAWK We're to report to Washington for debriefing.
HAWK Hawk rolls his wheelchair to the door.
RIPCORD That's it?
RIPCORD They've got Duke!
Hawk stops his wheelchair, turns to them.
HAWK I said you were to report to Washington.
HAWK I didn't say when, or which route to take.
SCARLETT Maybe a northern one.
SCARLETT Hawk smiles and wheels out the door.
A NIGHT RAVEN rockets through the orange skies, SMASHING through the sound barrier with an ear-tingling SONIC BOOM.
Storm Shadow sits in a meditative state.
Duke is shackled, hands bound, out of his ACCELERATOR SUIT.
Ana steps out of the cockpit area and approaches him, nods to Storm Shadow.
ANA He thinks I should kill you.
DUKE Why don't you?
ANA James wants to meet you in person.
DUKE James?
ANA Mr McCullen.
DUKE Ana listen--
ANA --Talk softly, or he'll tazer you again.
DUKE Loosen these, he'll never taser anything again.
DUKE She taps the bonds on his wrists.
ANA I should've thought of this before.
ANA They almost share a smile.
DUKE Let me get this straight.
DUKE You're with McCullen.
DUKE You're married to that Baron.
DUKE And you claim you're still in love with me.
ANA I'm a complex woman.
DUKE Maybe you just don't know who you are anymore.
ANA Who I was died long ago.
DUKE No, this isn't you, I still see the person I loved behind your eyes.
DUKE Her eyes soften for a moment.
ANA Tell me what she was like.
DUKE She was smart, and funny.
DUKE She was loyal as hell.
DUKE She loved those she was close with, me, her brother...
DUKE I did my best.
DUKE With Rex.
DUKE I'm sorry.
DUKE He was my responsibility.
DUKE I should have...
DUKE It's why I left, Ana.
DUKE Why I couldn't be with you.
DUKE You were in so much pain...
DUKE I thought the sight of me just give you more.
DUKE She seems to be affected by this ever so slightly, then...
DUKE a hard, cold look comes to her eyes, she shakes her head.
ANA It doesn't matter now.
DUKE No, it matters very much.
DUKE We have the chance to make things right.
ANA Nothing will ever be right again.
ANA Duke stares at her, his heart ripped apart.
ANA WE PUSH IN ON
the two of them and FLASHBACK TO:
Rain is drizzling on a military cemetery.
Ana sits alone, without family, without Duke, staring straight ahead as Rex's casket is lowered into the ground.
Parked on a nearby road is a lone car.
Duke sits inside it, staring at the funeral in the distance.
His face tells us the anguish he's living with.
He pulls out and starts to drive away, the rain on the windshield BLURS AS WE DISSOLVE
The Night Raven zeroes down on a stretch of ice near a huge CAVE.
A SET OF RUNWAY LIGHTS appear under the ice, guiding it in for a smooth landing.
The cave swallows the plane whole.
The Night Raven rolls to a stop inside the cave.
The side door opens.
Storm Shadow exits with the weapons case.
Ana leads Duke out, two Neo-Vipers behind them.
Storm Shadow clicks a hand held remote and a HIDDEN ICE WALL opens to reveal a HI-TECH DIVING BELL awaiting them.
Duke uses the moment to lunge forward, grab the case and haul ass towards the cave door.
Storm Shadow spins, Shurikan throwing stars in his hands.
The Neo-Vipers whip up their pulse rifles.
ANA NO!
ANA McCullen has plans for him!
ANA Storm Shadow throws a star, it whistles across the cave and nails Duke in his shoulder, Duke goes down hard, staggers back up, but the Neo-Vipers are already on him, they start beating the living shit out of him.
ANA Ana jogs up.
ANA (CONT'D) Enough!
ANA (CONT'D) Storm Shadow picks up the case and looks at Duke, face down, bloody and beaten.
STORM SHADOW And what was your plan?
STORM SHADOW Run three thousand miles across the ice?
STORM SHADOW He rips his star out of Duke's shoulder.
STORM SHADOW Duke sucks it up.
STORM SHADOW (CONT'D) Stupid soldier.
STORM SHADOW (CONT'D) Duke rolls over and stares up at them, breathing hard.
Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, Heavy Duty and Breaker are in the conn tower of a next-gen submarine, going over a 3-D MAP of the polar ice cap.
HEAVY DUTY That's a lotta ice.
RIPCORD It's gonna be like trying to find whale spit in the ocean.
RIPCORD Breaker sees a SMALL LIGHT flashing on his Ball-Eyepiece.
BREAKER That's strange.
SCARLETT What?
BREAKER When they stole the weapons case, I set my suit to scan for the tracker beacon in case it came back on, and it just came back on.
BREAKER Ripcord just smiles.
RIPCORD That's my boy.
The DIVING BELL comes shooting down out of a shaft in the bottom of the ice cap and rockets down towards the facility.
As the diving bell descends, Duke stares at the facility out the portal.
He is awed by the immense size of the place, he looks at Ana, proud of her office.
ANA Certain work needs to be done away from the public eye.
The diving bell entry port opens, guarded by two Neo-Vipers.
McCullen stands waiting.
His eyes first move to the weapons case in Storm Shadow's hands.
Storm Shadow opens it and shows him the three remaining warheads.
McCullen runs his fingers over them, then nods, Storm Shadow closes the case.
MCCULLEN Take them to the drones.
MCCULLEN I want them ready to launch in one hour.
STORM SHADOW It will be done.
STORM SHADOW And only then does McCullen greet Ana.
MCCULLEN My beautiful Lady of the Lake...
MCCULLEN He kisses her.
MCCULLEN Ana kisses him back with slightly-feigned affection, her eyes open and on Duke.
MCCULLEN Duke stands there, impassive.
MCCULLEN McCullen finishes the kiss and turns to Duke.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) This bother you?
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Duke says nothing, so McCullen steps closer.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Isn't it funny, with the entire balance of power in the world about to shift, a couple of guys can still have a stare down over who gets the girl.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Duke takes the opportunity to HEAD BUTT McCullen.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) The Neo- Vipers instantly pummel Duke to the floor.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) McCullen wipes a small trickle of blood from his nose.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) The interesting thing about my Neo- Vipers is they still think the same thoughts they always did, they just can't act on them anymore.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Instead, they do what I want.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) I imagine that must be very frustrating.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) He gets right down in Duke's face.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) I'm going to make you very unhappy.
DUKE I'm already happy.
DUKE McCullen glances at Ana, watching the display with conflicted eyes.
DUKE McCullen heads for the door, beckoning the Neo-Vipers to make Duke follow him.
Duke trails behind McCullen and Ana, flanked by Neo-Vipers.
DUKE What're you gonna do with the warheads?
MCCULLEN You take to your training well, that's good.
MCCULLEN Still trying to develop information.
MCCULLEN Still planning to escape and stope me.
MCCULLEN Moments from now, you'll see that won't ever happen.
DUKE Then you won't mind telling me.
MCCULLEN Isn't it clear?
MCCULLEN I'm a business man.
MCCULLEN I'm going to use them.
DUKE Millions of people are gonna die if you launch those warheads.
DUKE What is it you want, McCullen?
MCCULLEN Merely to strike fear into the hearts of every man, woman, and child on the planet.
MCCULLEN Only then will they look up to the man who wields the most power, and obey him.
The control room is alive with TECHNICIANS squirreling about various stations.
Monitors show three large AERIAL DRONES sitting in vertical launch bays.
Duke sees the drones and his face registers the horror of what McCullen's about to do.
He glances at Ana, she quietly looks away, a hint of remorse in her eyes?
The Doctor rises to greet McCullen, glancing at Duke for several moments, as if struck by the sight of him.
MCCULLEN Meet the genius behind all my nanotechnology.
THE DOCTOR My genius lies only in taking what others created to the logical next steps.
THE DOCTOR All modern gains in science are made through theft.
MCCULLEN You'll have to excuse his modesty, when I found him, he was --
THE DOCTOR --Another "recruit"?
MCCULLEN Albeit a rather unwilling one.
MCCULLEN The Doctor's nano-mites can control all manner of brain functions.
MCCULLEN When you wake up, you'll be working for me, and your past will be a distant shimmer that floats in and out of your mind like a leaf on a breeze.
THE DOCTOR I'll prepare him for the surgery.
THE DOCTOR The Doctor beckons the Neo-Vipers who shove Duke after him towards another door.
THE DOCTOR Duke and Ana exchange one last look.
THE DOCTOR McCullen keeps his eyes on her as she watches him go.
A school of fish swims past the facility, one fish breaks away from the school.
CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT ON IT: it's not a fish at all, but a mini robotic underwater spy system.
A sleek submarine drifts silently through the arctic waters.
Picture's coming on line now.
In the Conn Tower of the sub, our team gathers around Breaker who sits at a monitor watching what the "fish" is watching.
SCARLETT It's an underwater facility...
HEAVY DUTY McCullen's home away from home.
RIPCORD Dukes' gotta be in there somewhere.
SCARLETT Wait, what's that?
SCARLETT Breaker ZOOMS IN on a massive TURBO-LASER CANNON.
BREAKER Oh, Jesus...That's an automated, phased array turbo-pulse battery.
BREAKER A really big gun.
SCARLETT Could it take out our sub?
BREAKER That thing could take out a dozen subs simultaneously.
SCARLETT Then that's our first objective.
RIPCORD No, no.
RIPCORD Duke's our first objective.
SCARLETT The main force can't attack as long as that cannon's online.
HEAVY DUTY How you figure getting it offline?
HEAVY DUTY Snake-Eyes points to the DIVING BELL CABLES n the monitor.
SCARLETT Elevator cables.
SCARLETT They've got a surface entrance.
SCARLETT Shipwreck?
SCARLETT She turns to the submarine commander, HECTOR "SHIPWRECK" DELGADO, a fiery Spanish naval combat veteran.
SHIPWRECK Going up, senorita?
SHIPWRECK Scarlett nods and leads the others down a corridor.
SCARLETT Snake-Eyes, Breaker, Ripcord, and I will infiltrate the factory from above and destroy the cannon.
SCARLETT Heavy D, as soon as we give the word, you lead the assault from outside.
HEAVY DUTY Go, Joes...
A quiet wind blows across a remote stretch of arctic ice.
All of a sudden the ice pack begins to tremble like the mother of all earthquakes.
It cracks and ruptures and then erupts as the CONN TOWER of the submarine crashes through, then grinds to a halt.
A FORWARD HATCH OPENS and two ROCK SLIDES launch out, landing hard on the ice and speeding away.
Ripcord and Breaker on one.
Scarlett and Snake-Eyes on the other.
McCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch monitors showing TECHNICIANS securing the warheads onto three rocket propelled SMART-DRONES.
As the last one is secured a Technician says:
TECHNICIAN All drones prepared and ready, Sir.
MCCULLEN Good, commence the launch sequence immediately.
MCCULLEN is that a ripple of concern flickering across Ana's face?
INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY Our team races into the ice cave on their ROCK SLIDES and park beside the dormant Night Raven.
INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY Weapons up.
INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY Scanning the place from top to bottom.
INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY Ripcord stars at the awesome plane towering before him.
RIPCORD That McCullen's got some gadgets.
RIPCORD Breaker gestures to the ice wall.
RIPCORD Snake-Eyes uses his Katana sword to slice a circle in the wall and yank it out, revealing the DIVING BELL CABLES, but no diving bell.
BREAKER Maybe we could slide down.
BREAKER Snake-Eyes shakes his head, doubtful
SCARLETT The arctic water would kill us.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY McCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch the drones sitting in the launch bays on the screens.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY Technicians are working hard.
TECHNICIAN Three...
TECHNICIAN two...
TECHNICIAN one...
TECHNICIAN ignite primary engines.
TECHNICIAN The entire control room begins to shake.
TECHNICIAN The screens fill with fire.
INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY The Joes run outside, wondering what the hell is causing the earthquake.
INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY A large circle of ice near them MELTS.
INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY And then the first drone EXPLODES UP before them and LAUNCHES into the morning sky, peeling away to the east.
INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY Before they can react, the second drone EXPLODES UP a hundred yards away, peeling off to the west.
INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY They hear the third one about to rocket up--
Snake-Eyes thinks fast, sprints into the cave, jumps on a Rock Slide, hauls-ass outside, hits a WEAPONS SWITCH on his Rock Slide, prepping two HEAT-SEEKING ROCKETS on either side of the vehicle.
The third drone LAUNCHES UP from two hundred yards away.
Snake-Eyes locks onto its exhaust and FIRES.
The missiles race up after the drone and knock it out of the sky.
It EXPLODES.
Metal FLIES.
Snow BURNS.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY The technicians see this on their monitors.
TECHNICIAN We lost one.
MCCULLEN Lost one?
MCCULLEN What do you mean?
TECHNICIAN Bird Three is down, Sir.
TECHNICIAN McCullen looks at the monitors, enraged.
TECHNICIAN Storm Shadow smiles.
STORM SHADOW We're under attack.
MCCULLEN Alert all defences.
MCCULLEN Charge up the pulse cannon.
MCCULLEN He turns to say something to Ana, but she has left the room.
Topside, the team watches the two remaining drones race away.
BREAKER What about the other two?
RIPCORD We find the kill switches and short out the nano-mites.
BREAKER They're already way out of range.
SCARLETT Then somebody has to go up there and shoot those things down.
That's me.
Ripcord climbs into the Night Raven's cockpit.
Scarlett steps up to watch.
He's already flipping switches and putting on a
SCARLETT Can you even fly this thing?
RIPCORD I can fly anything.
RIPCORD You just track those warheads and guide me in.
RIPCORD We don't have long until they hit.
SCARLETT Ripcord?
SCARLETT He glances at her, a moment between them.
SCARLETT Then she presses forward and kisses him on the mouth.
SCARLETT He stares back at her.
SCARLETT (CONT'D) Good luck.
RIPCORD Do me a favor?
RIPCORD Save Duke.
RIPCORD She gives him a nod, then leaves.
RIPCORD Ripcord grins to himself.
The NIGHT RAVEN tears across the ice and launches into the sky.
Ripcord WHOOPS with adrenaline.
Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Breaker fast rope down into the first launch bay as the ice REFORMS behind them, hiding the hole.
We now find Duke, wearing only SURGICAL TROUSERS, strapped on the operating gurney we saw Zartan on earlier.
The SMART ROBOTS warming up around him as the Doctor approaches.
THE DOCTOR The atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima destroyed seventy percent of the city.
THE DOCTOR Seventy percent...
THE DOCTOR Did you know that, Duke?
Duke looks at him, something familiar.
REX There was a bank situated less than one hundred yards from Ground Zero, destroyed of course.
REX Only one thing survived.
REX It's four bank vaults.
REX And when those vaults were opened, they discovered everything inside them had survived completely unscathed.
DUKE Who are you?
THE DOCTOR Of course, the vault I took shelter in wasn't that well-made.
THE DOCTOR He unclips his BREATHING TUBES and lowers the mask to reveal a scarred and burned face.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Double Bubble?
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Duke is beyond shocked.
DUKE Rex...
DUKE Rex immediately has trouble breathing and returns the mask over his face.
DUKE (CONT'D) You sonuvabitch...
DUKE (CONT'D) Ana buried you.
THE DOCTOR A moving ceremony, I'm sure.
THE DOCTOR The three volley salute.
THE DOCTOR The flag on the coffin.
DUKE Why?
DUKE .Why didn't you come in...?
THE DOCTOR Because I found out the truth...
Rex moves through the building with Fireteam Bravo.
Intel says the lab's in the basement.
Fireteam Bravo kicks open a door.
They lead the way down a staircase toward the basement.
Rex follows, nervous as hell.
The soldiers round a corner, suddenly, Rex hears GUNFIRE, he freezes, then silence, Rex pulls out his .45 And rounds the corner to see Fireteam Bravo down.
A GUARD is trying to clear a jam in his machine gun.
As he clears the weapon and raises it, Rex raises his .45 and fires first.
The Guard drops.
Rex checks Bravo, but they're not moving.
He looks around the basement, no lab, but he sees a massive VAULT DOOR, closed.
He heads for the vault, 45 raised, breathing hard.
WHOOSH, a blast of refrigerated air hits him as he opens the door.
Rex enters a small room filled with DEAD ANIMALS in huge FORMALDEHYDE JARS> Something inside the animals is constantly reshaping their appearances, reforming their facial bones and changing the color, texture and elasticity of their skins.
There is a scuffling noise, Rex points his gun.
A small, stooped old SCIENTIST in a lab coat appears.
SCIENTIST Are you going to shoot me?...
SCIENTIST Rex doesn't respond.
SCIENTIST (CONT'D) We knew you were coming.
SCIENTIST (CONT'D) But I couldn't walk away from it...
SCIENTIST (CONT'D) Rex stares in awe, not what he was expecting.
REX Stay where you are.
REX His gun up, he finds a COMPUTER TERMINAL and begins accessing various files, starts reading them.
REX (CONT'D) These aren't chemical or nuclear--
SCIENTIST No.
SCIENTIST Something much...
SCIENTIST better.
This is beyond anything...
This is light years ahead of anyone in the field.
SCIENTIST You see why I couldn't leave.
SCIENTIST Rex nods, hypnotized by the science in front of him, an instant bond formed with the man who created it.
SCIENTIST The distant sound of Jets.
SCIENTIST The Scientist moves to the vault door and begins pulling it closed as we hear the J-Dam Bunker Buster whistling towards them.
SCIENTIST (CONT'D) If we live, I'll show you everything...
Duke tries to absorb what he's learned.
The Doctor continues.
THE DOCTOR The man who created this technology was not our enemy.
THE DOCTOR In fact, he was hired by our very own government to create it.
THE DOCTOR When it was deemed too unethical, they sent us to kill him.
THE DOCTOR He didn't survive the blast.
THE DOCTOR But I...
THE DOCTOR lived.
THE DOCTOR And I escaped with his research.
THE DOCTOR Unfortunately I tested it on myself first, and lost my lungs and vocal chords in the process.
THE DOCTOR But now I've perfected it, and you will get a first-hand experience.
DUKE Does Ana know about this, about you?
THE DOCTOR No...
THE DOCTOR and she never will.
THE DOCTOR He glances at the SMART ROBOTS and Duke realizes.
DUKE You sick bastard...
DUKE you did this to your own sister?
I loved my sister!
Do you have any idea the state she was in?
Me dead.
You AWOL.
Depression, drugs.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) So, I had her brought here, gave her a way to deal with her pain, gave her purpose.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Made her strong.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) I gave her a new life, Duke.
DUKE Why work for McCullen?
THE DOCTOR He saved my life, for starters.
THE DOCTOR Now to mention infinite resources to work in the field of my choosing.
DUKE That's bullshit.
DUKE You could have had any job you wanted.
THE DOCTOR I didn't want any job.
THE DOCTOR You can't play nice with science, Duke.
THE DOCTOR It's sometimes necessary to experiment, to fail, even to destroy to attain a goal.
THE DOCTOR It's a fact that McCullen has the guts to embrace.
DUKE Everything she's done, everything she's become, started because she thought you died that day.
THE DOCTOR And because you then abandoned her, let's not forget that part.
THE DOCTOR And with that, he leaves Duke to the SMART ROBOTS, which menacingly begin to move in.
Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Breaker drop down into the launch bay.
They see a chrome corridor leading into the facility.
SCARLETT It's pressure plated and laser protected.
SCARLETT Anyway around it?
BREAKER No.
BREAKER Any object larger than a quarter will fry your britches.
BREAKER Snake-Eyes shakes his head with a sigh, then steps forward and leaps onto the floor, landing on his fingertips.
Then, with incredible strength, he proceeds to walk across the floor on his fingertips, aware of the continuous crackle and hum of lasers around him.
Scarlett and Breaker watch with baited breath.
Snake- Eyes now reaches the doorway.
BREAKER (CONT'D) What you'll have to do is rewire the laser panel's brain by-- --Snake-Eyes swiftly balances on one set of fingertips while his other fingers grab his sword and STAB the laser panel.
BREAKER (CONT'D) The sound of the laser net instantly vanishes.
BREAKER (CONT'D) .or you cold just stab it.
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY Duke lies on the operating table as a SMART ROBOT makes an incision behind his right ear.
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY Duke grimaces.
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY A long needle zeroes in on the incision.
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY As the needle dives towards Duke's head, a hand hits a switch and the needle quickly retracts.
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY Duke looks over to see Ana by the controls, gazing at him.
ANA I don't have much time.
ANA She rushes over and unties him and they stare at each other, then kiss passionately.
ANA All of a sudden, Duke feels something behind her right ear, he turns her head, --an INCISION SCAR.
ANA He looks at her, but before he can say anything, Ana's body snaps rigid and falls limp in his arms.
DUKE Ana!
DUKE Duke looks over to see the Doctor holding his PDA, McCullen and two Neo-Vipers beside him, their rifles on Duke and Ana.
DUKE Duke gazes at Ana, desperately feeling for her pulse.
INT. TURBO LASER CONTROL ROOM - DAY Two TECHNICIANS man the firing controls of the huge TURBO LASER CANNON.

INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY Breaker takes over a station console.
BREAKER Okay, I've got a lock on the two remaining warheads.
BREAKER Target one is Moscow!
BREAKER Target Two is Washington!
SCARLETT Give Ripcord the coordinates.
INT. TURBO LASER CONTROL ROOM - DAY Snake-Eyes spins to see a pair of KATANA BLADES come crashing down at him from behind.
INT. TURBO LASER CONTROL ROOM - DAY He spins, but one of the blades cuts him on his left arm, sending him reeling backwards, it's Storm Shadow.
INT. TURBO LASER CONTROL ROOM - DAY Who quickly powers the laser cannon back online.
INT. TURBO LASER CONTROL ROOM - DAY Snake-Eyes dives to stop
him, --and as their swords meet WE FLASH CUT TO: THE GROUNDS OF THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where two sixteen year- olds, Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow, trade blows with wooden katanas.
Storm Shadow drops Snake-Eyes, who falls hard, Storm Shadow steps on his throat, sword point in Snake- Eyes' face.
Hard Master looks on without expression.
FLASH CUT BACK TO: THE CONTROL ROOM, where Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow's blades flash like lightning, they battle fiercely around the room.
A Neo-Viper charges up the controls.
Snake can't stop him.
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY Outside, the massive TURBO-LASER swings wildly towards the submarine and fires.
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY A BRILLIANT BLUE PULSE ripples through the arctic sea, glancing the side of the vessel.
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY WHAM!!
INT. CONN TOWER - DAY The submarine shakes hard.
INT. CONN TOWER - DAY Rivets burst.
INT. CONN TOWER - DAY Water pours in.
SHIPWRECK The hull's been ruptured!
HEAVY DUTY Everyone into the attack boats!
Hatches open along the sides of the submarine, deploying ten SHARC ATTACK CRAFT carrying dozens of Joes.
At the same time, batches begin to open on the facility and a dozen MANTIS attack craft carrying dozens of Neo-Vipers emerge.
INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY Heavy Duty and Shipwreck pilot one of the SHARCS.
INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY The huge opposing force coming at them is quite terrifying.
HEAVY DUTY Keep tight everybody.
HEAVY DUTY He fires a HARPOON TORPEDO which BLASTS a Mantis.
HEAVY DUTY The mantis craft RETURN FIRE.
HEAVY DUTY The whole area explodes in a pulse fire and harpoon blasts.
HEAVY DUTY The Joe submarine sinks and EXPLODES at the base of the facility.
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY Duke cuddles dead Ana, clearly emotional.
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY McCullen steps up.
MCCULLEN Is she still alive?
THE DOCTOR For now.
MCCULLEN You said this couldn't happen.
THE DOCTOR I didn't think it could.
THE DOCTOR I've never seen anyone defeat the programming, even momentarily.
THE DOCTOR Duke recovers and angrily grabs one of Ana's PISTOLS and kills the two Neo-Vipers, then turns the gun on the others.
THE DOCTOR The Doctor lifts his PDA, finger on the "TERMINATE" BUTTON.
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) If I press this, Ana dies.
DUKE Put it down.
THE DOCTOR Your choice, Duke.
DUKE Put it down!
DUKE The Doctor doesn't move.
DUKE McCullen watches the stand-off his right hand discreetly drawing STEEL HOSE out from his sleeve.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY Ripcord streaks into the upper atmosphere in the Night Raven, the curve of the Earth visible out his windows.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY Ahead, he can see a PULSATING LIGHT.
RIPCORD I see it, dead ahead.
Breaker speaks into his headset.
BREAKER You have to knock it down before it re-enters the atmosphere so the nano-mites don't reach the ground.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY Ripcord flicks a switch and opens a PULSE LASER on the nose.
RIPCORD Uh, I've got a problem.
RIPCORD The fire controls are not in here.
BREAKER'S VOICE What do you mean, not in there?
RIPCORD I mean I can't see them anywhere!
INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY Scarlett hears this and realizes.
SCARLETT It's gotta be voice-activated.
RIPCORD'S VOICE What?
SCARLETT You have to say the words into your flight helmet.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY Ripcord lines up the missile in his sights, gets a lock.
RIPCORD Fire!
RIPCORD Shoot!
RIPCORD Blast away!
RIPCORD Still nothing, the missile streaking onwards towards the Earth.
INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY They hear Ripcord yelling over the speakers.
RIPCORD'S VOICE Nothing's happening!
BREAKER Must be a different language.
SCARLETT Try "teine".
RIPCORD'S VOICE What?
SCARLETT It's Scottish for fire.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY Ripcord's not sure about this, the missile arcing down.
RIPCORD Teine.
SCARLETT Listen to my voice, "Teine".
RIPCORD Teine!
RIPCORD Teine!
RIPCORD Teine!
RIPCORD It's not working!
SCARLETT'S VOICE That's because you're not saying it right!
RIPCORD How many different ways you want me to say it?
SCARLETT'S VOICE One way!
SCARLETT'S VOICE The right way!
SCARLETT'S VOICE Teine!
RIPCORD Teine!
RIPCORD And at last the PULSE LASER fires.
RIPCORD Blasting the missile out of the sky.
RIPCORD The CLOUD OF NANO-MITES floats aimlessly away.
INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY They all see the missile disappear on their screen.
BREAKER Nice work, Ace.
BREAKER You just saved Moscow.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY Ripcord sighs with relief, already peeling away.
RIPCORD Just doing my job.

RIPCORD (CONT'D) .man, I freakin' saved Moscow!
The White House glistens in the midday sun.
INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY The American President's Bodyguards rush him and his staff down into a fortified bunker beneath the White House.
PRESIDENT How soon will it strike the city?
STAFFER Seventeen minutes, Sir.
PRESIDENT This will be a disaster the likes of which we have never seen.
PRESIDENT As the DOORS CLOSE behind them we see the MARS INDUSTRIES LOGO on the doors.
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY Another blast from the TURBO-LASER destroys a SHARC.
INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY Heavy Duty sees this as he takes out a MANTIS.
SHIPWRECK That cannon's going to kill us all.
HEAVY DUTY My guy will take care of it, trust me.
Snake-Eyes kills the Neo-Viper, who falls down a large shaft into freezing waters.
Storm Shadow lunges at Snake-Eyes and the two of them tumble down into the shaft, but land on a gangway.
They both leap up and begin to fight again.
The Neo- Viper tries to crawl out of the freezing water, seemingly unfazed as he slowly freezes solid.
All of a sudden, there's LOUD NOISES and a series of ENERGY LASERS power on up and down the shaft between various circuit modules.
This is where the energy is charged to operate the cannon.
One of the lasers catches Storm Shadow's shoulder and burns him severely.
Snake-Eyes sees this and ducks just as an ENERGY LASER fires on beside his head.
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY Outside, the TURBO-LASER fires.
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY The Joe craft desperately weave and dodge.
INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY .and the LASER NET fades.
INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY Instantly, Storm Shadow and Snake- Eyes continue their desperate fight.
INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY Swords FLASH and CLANG,
two masters at their best.
AND WE FLASH CUT TO: THE GROUNDS OF THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where two twenty-two year olds, Storm Shadow and Snake-Eyes sword fight.
Storm Shadow knocks Snake-Eyes to the ground again and places his steel sword against Snake-Eyes' face.
Again, Hard Master watches without expression.
AND WE FLASH CUT BACK TO: THE ENERGY SHAFT, where Storm Shadow slashes Snake-Eyes across the chest, but before he can finish him off, the cannon charges up again and the LASER NET slams on.
Storm Shadow twists his body to avoid the ENERGY LASERS while Snake- Eyes lifts himself up to his toes to avoid a laser that threatens to disintegrate his crotch.
Storm Shadow sees this, grins to himself.
INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY A staffer is on the phone, looking up at the President.
STAFFER It seems somebody's shot down the warhead heading for Moscow.
PRESIDENT Thank God...
PRESIDENT As he says this, a SECRET SERVICE AGENT draws a SILENCED PISTOL and kills the other Agents and Staff.
PRESIDENT We see an INCISION SCAR behind his right ear and realize he is a Neo- Viper.
PRESIDENT The President stares, stunned and horrified.
PRESIDENT The Neo- Viper holds his pistol on the President as--
--A BOOKCASE moves on the wall, revealing a secret room.
An UNSEEN FIGURE emerges and the President stares in shock.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY Up in the skies, Ripcord spots the second drone rocketing down towards the lower atmosphere in front of him.
RIPCORD Second drone in my sights.
INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY Breaker and Scarlett watch in the control room.

INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY Ripcord's feeling the pressure.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY He targets the missile.
RIPCORD Taine!
RIPCORD But nothing happens.
RIPCORD Scarlett's voice yells in his head.
SCARLETT'S VOICE Teine!
SCARLETT'S VOICE Teine!
RIPCORD Don't yell at me!
SCARLETT'S VOICE Teine.
SCARLETT'S VOICE Ripcord takes a breath, stealing his nerves.
SCARLETT'S VOICE A RED FUEL LIGHT starts beeping on his control board.
SCARLETT'S VOICE Rip does his best to ignore it, focusing on the missile as it begins to disappear into the lower atmosphere.
SCARLETT'S VOICE The light beats faster and louder.
RIPCORD Teine!
RIPCORD The LASER PULSE fires, blasting straight at the missile which is lost in the atmospheric haze below.
RIPCORD For a moment, he can't tell if he hit it or not.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY The tracking in the control room provides the answer.
BREAKER You missed!
BREAKER The warhead has entered the lower atmosphere!
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY Ripcord realizes this as he enters the lower atmosphere himself.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY The spread of WASHINGTON D.C. Far below him now.
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY In the operating chamber, the stand-off reaches its boiling point now.
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY McCullen slowly approaching Duke who keeps Ana's pistol on the Doctor, Ana still in Duke's arms.
MCCULLEN Did you think she loved you?
DUKE Stay back!
MCCULLEN Did you imagine your life with her?
DUKE I said stay back!
THE DOCTOR Don't you know you've lost, Duke?
DUKE All I know is that neither of you deserves her.
DUKE McCullen suddenly lifts the STEEL HOSE in his right hand-- --A BURST OF FLAME tears out at Duke who reflexively fires the PULSE PISTOL at it.
DUKE The intense air blast from the pulse pistol catches the flames midway between them and blows them back onto McCullen.
DUKE McCullen SCREAMS as his face is literally burned off.
DUKE The Doctor freaks and drops the PDA, then yanks McCullen out into the corridor.
DUKE Duke fires after them, then grabs the PDA, removing Ana's screen with a sigh of relief.
Above Washington, Ripcord guns his aircraft after the falling drone.
Getting real close this time.
No way he can miss.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY They see this on the screens in the control room.
BREAKER You're too close, Rip.
BREAKER Back up.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY Ripcord gets eerily calm all of a sudden.
RIPCORD Actually, I think I'm just about close enough...
.teine.
The PULSE LASER fires point blank.
The missile EXPLODES right in front of him.
Ripcord flies through the flames, the CLOUD OF NANO-MITES latching onto his wings.
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY The drone disappears from their screens now.
SCARLETT Ripcord?
SCARLETT What happened?
SCARLETT Rip!
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY Ripcord is now struggling mightily with his controls as the NANO-MITES swiftly eat his plane.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY His FUEL LIGHT flashes at him alarmingly.
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY He angles the Night Raven upwards, giving it all he's got, NANO-MITES everywhere.

RIPCORD Cur magh!
RIPCORD The canopy explodes.
RIPCORD Rip shoots back down into the atmosphere as the NANO-MITES devour the Night Raven, then float away...
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY They see this on their screens.
BREAKER He did it...
BREAKER He actually did it...
SCARLETT Ripcord?
SCARLETT Talk to me...Ripcord!
Still nothing.
And now they begin to suspect the worst.
Then:
RIPCORD'S VOICE I asked you not to yell at me.
RIPCORD'S VOICE Relief comes rushing back to Scarlett and Breaker.
SCARLETT What happened?
SCARLETT Are you okay?
RIPCORD'S VOICE Yeah, did it work?
SCARLETT Yes...yes, it worked.
Ripcord smiles, parachuting down towards Washington.
RIPCORD Good...cause I think I'm about to get arrested.
Ripcord lands on the White House lawn, holding his hands up benignly as dozens of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS surround him.
INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY ENERGY LASERS pulse on again, almost catching the two ninjas in their fight.
INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY Snake-Eyes draws his KATANA SWORD, its blade shimmering in the laser-light as he redirects the laser back into its module.

INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY But before we find out the climax to
their fight, we must finish their story: ON THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE GROUNDS, Snake-Eyes, still 26, walks along the pond.
He hears a LOUD CRY.
Snake-Eyes breaks into a run, careens around a building and sees Hard Master slumped on the ground, a sword in his back.
SNAKE-EYES Master!
SNAKE-EYES Other NINJAS come flooding in.
That's Storm Shadow's sword!
There!
There's the murderer!
Snake-Eyes spins to see Storm Shadow climb up the side of the Temple, onto the rood, give him a last look, and jump down over the wall.
FLASH BACK TO: THE ENERGY SHAFT where Snake- Eyes is suddenly filled with renewed energy, he stares up at Storm Shadow's katana blade poised for the final kill.
STORM SHADOW You took your vow of silence to avenge our Master.
STORM SHADOW But now you will die without a word.
STORM SHADOW The LOUD NOISE gears up again, distracting Storm Shadow for just a beat.
STORM SHADOW Snake-Eyes uses the moment to catch Storm shadow with his feet, holding him up for a split second as the ENERGY LASERS come back on.
STORM SHADOW One of them burns deeply across Storm Shadow's neck, he SCREAMS and stumbles back and falls OVER THE EDGE and down into the freezing turgid waters.
STORM SHADOW Snake- Eyes steps up and looks down to see if he surfaces...
STORM SHADOW He doesn't.
SNAKE-EYES Father always feared it would come to this.
SNAKE-EYES EXPLOSIONS begin to rock the shaft now.
SNAKE-EYES Snake-Eyes stumbles towards the exit, leaving his fallen Sword Brother behind.
INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY Heavy Duty sees the cannon return to its dormant position.
HEAVY DUTY Turbo-laser is down!
HEAVY DUTY He guns his engines, firing at a MANTIS attack craft.
HEAVY DUTY It EXPLODES.
HEAVY DUTY Heavy Duty howls with delight.
HEAVY DUTY Around him, the Joes begin to turn the tide of the battle.
HEAVY DUTY A SERIES OF SHOTS of Mantis vehicles getting nailed by Joe harpoon cannons.
They feel the EXPLOSIONS in the control room.
Screens short out.
Water starts to cascade in through BURSTING RIVETS.
BREAKER Energy overload in the phased array battery.
BREAKER Power subsystems are going critical.
SCARLETT Let's get out of here!
SCARLETT Scarlett grabs Breaker by the scruff of the neck and hauls him out of the room.
McCullen's face is horrifically burned as The Doctor helps him down into the Trident.
EXPLOSIONS blowing above them.
The pilots guide the sub out white the Doctor starts injecting McCullen with NANO-MITES.
McCullen starts to SCREAM...
Scarlett and Breaker races into the diving bell entry port and are shocked to find Snake-Eyes already here.
Scarlett runs up and gently hugs him.
SCARLETT Snake!
SCARLETT Snake-Eyes grimaces, then looks Scarlett in the eyes.
SNAKE-EYES .he's dead.
SNAKE-EYES She knows who he means, she gives him a grim smile.
SNAKE-EYES And that's when they see Duke, carrying Ana, charging up to them.
SNAKE-EYES Another EXPLOSION makes them all dash into the diving bell.
SNAKE-EYES The doors close and we hear them launch.
INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY Heavy Duty notices the Trident escaping out of the EXPLODING docking bay into the arctic water.

HEAVY DUTY INSIDE THE DIVING BELL: Our heroes are rocked by the BLAST, then they see MASSIVE CHUNKS OF POLAR ICE plummet down from the ice pack above, cutting off Heavy Duty and the Joes, and DEMOLISHING the remainder of the facility.
HEAVY DUTY The Trident disappears behind the trillions of bubbles and falling ice.
Shipwreck checks his targeting scanner.
SHIPWRECK All other targets neutralized.
The Trident is moving fast through the water somewhere.
McCullen turns to us and we see that the NANO-MITES have created a FORM-FITTING MASK all over his face.
He catches his reflection in the portal and he grabs at the mask, the NANO- MITES twisting with the contours of his muscles to reveal his complete and ever-lasting horror.
He breaks down, falling to the floor, then he recovers and looks up at The Doctor.
MCCULLEN I guess I should thank you, Doctor.
MCCULLEN The Doctor is busy fiddling with his hand held PDA.
THE DOCTOR I want you to call me...
THE DOCTOR Commander.
THE DOCTOR And from now on, I'll be on a first name basis with you, Destro.
THE DOCTOR McCullen's silver face goes blank.
MCCULLEN Yes, Commander.
Duke watches Ana through a two-way mirror.
She sits alone in a holding cell.
A MILITARY SCIENTIST watches her with Duke.
SCIENTIST Physically, she's fine.
SCIENTIST But without the correctly-coded kill frequency, we can't short them out.
DUKE There's nothing you can do?
SCIENTIST Only the man who put them in there has the correct code.
SCIENTIST Duke considers this carefully, staring at Ana.
Duke walks along a prison corridor with Ana, led by two PRISON GUARDS.
She carries a small bundle of PRISON GEAR.
DUKE I'll visit you.
ANA I won't be here long.
DUKE You'll be here for the rest of your life, Ana.
DUKE She looks at him, her face softening.
ANA Duke?
DUKE I'm here.
ANA After all I've done, .you can't save me, .it's too late.
ANA A BEAT passes between them.
DUKE I'll visit you.
DUKE And for a moment, she appears to crack...
DUKE but then a sinister smile creases her mouth.
ANA You know, this has only just begun.
ANA She touches his face, then the PRISON BARS slam shut between them.
ANA She holds his eyes a moment longer, then the two Prison Guards lead her away.
ANA Duke just watches her go, his face torn with pain.
ANA He walks off alone...
INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY General Hawk is in his wheelchair, still recovering from his wounds.
INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY He leads Duke and ripcord to the Howler.
HAWK With GI JOE reinstated, would you boys like to stay on awhile?
DUKE What do you say, Rip?
DUKE Ripcord looks at Scarlett, who throws him a wink and a smile.
RIPCORD I'm good.
RIPCORD They all laugh.
RIPCORD Rip steps up to her.
RIPCORD (CONT'D) So how do you feel about this?
SCARLETT I feel very...
SCARLETT emotional.
SCARLETT Duke smiles and the Joes climb aboard as the platform rises.
A bevy of SECRETARIES and STAFFERS greets the President.
Then he enters the Oval office and closes the door, alone, he looks around, walks behind the desk, and grins as he sits, as if this is the first time he's ever done this.
With a little flair, he CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and we realize this is Zartan!
And we SMASH CUT TO BLACK and ROLL CREDITS...
