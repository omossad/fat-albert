*Turbo-Charged Prelude*

After allowing fugitive Dominic Toretto to evade arrest, former LAPD officer Brian O'Conner finds himself on the run from the FBI and leaves Los Angeles to start a new life.
He travels across the U.S. in a red 2001 Mitsubishi GTO, entering various drag races and winning large amounts of money.
The FBI issues a country-wide manhunt against Brian and one day, the police locate him and repossess his car, forcing him to leave on foot.
A girl picks him up after he hitches a ride, and she drops him off at the local car lot, where he buys a 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 with the money he won.
After winning several more races, he decides to settle in Miami.

While in Miami, he meets Tej Parker, an ex-street racer/organizer who leads a top racing garage, as well as Jimmy, a well-known car tuner who works with Tej, and Suki, another street racer, and now lives in a small cot near Tej's garage.
After taking his Skyline to the streets of Miami and winning in races organized by Tej, he establishes a name for himself as one of Miami's top drivers, earning the nickname Bullitt.
