Neil Clarke (Simon Pegg) is a disillusioned schoolteacher, who suddenly finds and uses the ability to do anything he wants, a challenge bestowed upon him by a group of power-crazed aliens (John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin) watching him from space. As he struggles to deal with these new found powers and the events that subsequently arise, he calls upon his loyal canine companion and best friend Dennis (Robin Williams) to help him along the way.
