Hook's squad of British soldiers is sent to Belfast in 1971 in the early years of The Troubles. Under the leadership of the inexperienced Lieutenant Armitage, his squad goes to a volatile area of Belfast where Catholic Nationalists and Protestant Loyalists live side by side. The unit provides support for the Royal Ulster Constabulary as it inspects homes for firearms, shocking Hook with their rough treatment of women and children. The Catholic neighbourhood has been alerted to the activity and a crowd gathers to protest and provoke the British troops who, though heavily armed, can only respond by trying to hold the crowd back., One soldier leaves his gun on the ground in the confusion and a young boy runs off through the mob with it; Hook and another pursue him. As the crowd's protest escalates into rock-throwing, the soldiers and police pull out, leaving the two soldiers behind. Hook and the other soldier are briefly rescued by a sympathetic woman who fails to hold back a small crowd who are beating them. Hook sees the other soldier shot dead at point blank range by the young Nationalist Paul Haggerty and then, with the crowd physically engaging Haggerty, flees through streets and back alleys, finally eluding his pursuers and hiding until dark., A Protestant youngster brings Hook to a local pub that serves as a front for the Loyalists, where he glimpses a Loyalist group in a back room constructing a bomb under the guidance of the Military Reaction Force (MRF), the covert counter-insurgency unit of the British Army. Hook steps outside the pub just before an enormous explosion destroys the building. Hook flees once more into the dark streets. Unaware that the Loyalists have blown themselves up, each of the two IRA factions charges the other with responsibility for the bombing., Two Catholics, Eamon and his daughter Brigid, discover Hook as he lies unconscious in the street. They take him to their apartment and, even though they discover he is a British soldier, Eamon stitches his wounds. Eamon contacts Boyle, a senior IRA official, for help, expecting a more humane solution than the younger IRA faction would allow. Boyle, less radical and violent than younger IRA members, has a working relationship with the MRF. He tells MRF Captain Browning, leader of the British MRF section, of Hook's whereabouts and asks in return that Browning assassinate James Quinn, a key leader of the younger IRA faction., Quinn and his IRA squad have been tailing Boyle since the pub explosion and saw him visit Eamon's apartment without knowing why he was there. Sensing danger, Hook flees the apartment, taking with him a sheathed blade. Moving painfully through the apartment complex halls and stairways, he eludes the IRA men who have separated to search for him. Finally, unable to get away from Haggerty, who is about to come around a corner and discover him, Hook stabs him. As the wounded man lies dying, Hook reaches down and grasps his shoulder, sharing strength and sympathy as they hold each other's gaze and the IRA man dies., Hook is captured by Quinn's group and taken to a hideout. Quinn orders Sean, a young teen whom Quinn has recruited, to execute Hook. When Sean hesitates, Quinn prepares to execute Hook. Browning's group arrives, and Lewis, to Hook's horror, shoots Sean.

Hook's squad of British soldiers is sent to Belfast in 1971 in the early years of The Troubles. Under the leadership of the inexperienced Lieutenant Armitage, his squad goes to a volatile area of Belfast where Catholic Nationalists and Protestant Loyalists live side by side. The unit provides support for the Royal Ulster Constabulary as it inspects homes for firearms, shocking Hook with their rough treatment of women and children. The Catholic neighbourhood has been alerted to the activity and a crowd gathers to protest and provoke the British troops who, though heavily armed, can only respond by trying to hold the crowd back., One soldier leaves his gun on the ground in the confusion and a young boy runs off through the mob with it; Hook and another pursue him. As the crowd's protest escalates into rock-throwing, the soldiers and police pull out, leaving the two soldiers behind. Hook and the other soldier are briefly rescued by a sympathetic woman who fails to hold back a small crowd who are beating them. Hook sees the other soldier shot dead at point blank range by the young Nationalist Paul Haggerty and then, with the crowd physically engaging Haggerty, flees through streets and back alleys, finally eluding his pursuers and hiding until dark., A Protestant youngster brings Hook to a local pub that serves as a front for the Loyalists, where he glimpses a Loyalist group in a back room constructing a bomb under the guidance of the Military Reaction Force (MRF), the covert counter-insurgency unit of the British Army. Hook steps outside the pub just before an enormous explosion destroys the building. Hook flees once more into the dark streets. Unaware that the Loyalists have blown themselves up, each of the two IRA factions charges the other with responsibility for the bombing., Two Catholics, Eamon and his daughter Brigid, discover Hook as he lies unconscious in the street. They take him to their apartment and, even though they discover he is a British soldier, Eamon stitches his wounds. Eamon contacts Boyle, a senior IRA official, for help, expecting a more humane solution than the younger IRA faction would allow. Boyle, less radical and violent than younger IRA members, has a working relationship with the MRF. He tells MRF Captain Browning, leader of the British MRF section, of Hook's whereabouts and asks in return that Browning assassinate James Quinn, a key leader of the younger IRA faction., Quinn and his IRA squad have been tailing Boyle since the pub explosion and saw him visit Eamon's apartment without knowing why he was there. Sensing danger, Hook flees the apartment, taking with him a sheathed blade. Moving painfully through the apartment complex halls and stairways, he eludes the IRA men who have separated to search for him. Finally, unable to get away from Haggerty, who is about to come around a corner and discover him, Hook stabs him. As the wounded man lies dying, Hook reaches down and grasps his shoulder, sharing strength and sympathy as they hold each other's gaze and the IRA man dies., Hook is captured by Quinn's group and taken to a hideout. Quinn orders Sean, a young teen whom Quinn has recruited, to execute Hook. When Sean hesitates, Quinn prepares to execute Hook. Browning's group arrives, and Lewis, to Hook's horror, shoots Sean.

Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely., When Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat. Cameron selects ""bad boy"" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take out Kat, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca.

Patrick initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Kat is still angry with Patrick, but he wins her over by serenading her with the accompaniment of the marching band, and she helps him sneak out of detention. They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go with him to the prom, an event she is adamantly against. Bianca is irritated that Cameron hasn't asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter won't allow it unless Kat goes too. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were freshmen and, succumbing to peer pressure, had sex with him. Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey., All is going well at the prom until Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night. Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave heartbroken. Joey then punches Cameron, but is in turn beaten up by Bianca for having hurt her, Kat, and Cameron. Bianca and Cameron share another kiss., The next day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron. Walter admits that Kat is capable of taking care of herself, and gives her permission to attend Sarah Lawrence College.
